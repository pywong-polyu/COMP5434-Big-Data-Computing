Yet data from wild birds on seasonal fluctuations in prevalence and infection intensity, and thereby the potential high-risk times for virus transmission, have been lacking. We screened wild Crimson Rosellas (Platycercus elegans) for BFDV in blood and cloacal swabs. Prevalence in blood samples and cloacal swabs, as well as viral load varied with Julian date and in blood, were highest after the breeding season. Breeding birds had lower viral load and lower BFDV prevalence in blood than nonbreeding birds (10.1% prevalence in breeding vs. 43.2% in non-breeding birds). BFDV prevalence was much higher in younger (<3 years) than older (\u22653 years) birds for both blood samples (42.9% vs. 4.5%) and cloacal swabs (56.4% vs. 12.3%). BFDV status in blood and cloacal samples was not correlated within individuals. We show that, at least in P. elegans, BFDV infection seems to occur year-round, with seasonal changes in prevalence and load found in our samples. Our analyses suggest that the seasonal changes were associated primarily with the breeding season. We also discuss age and sex as important predictors of BFDV infection.",

Knowledge of temporal patterns of infection allows improved targeting of management strategies to times when pathogens are most prevalent 3,4 . Pathogens are often present in host populations year-round, but prevalence fluctuates seasonally 5 . Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this, including seasonal changes in weather 3,6 , in pathogen virulence and presence 5 , and variation in host susceptibility 7,8 . Seasonal breeding can influence host susceptibility, with lowered antibody production and increased parasite load during the breeding season often typical 9 and generally attributed to a weakened immune system during offspring care 3 . Only a few wildlife studies have investigated the influence of seasonal changes in host biology on pathogen dynamics, with the available studies finding a peak in pathogen prevalence after the breeding season, and explaining this via an influx of susceptible young into the host population 6,10 .",

This is concerning, as the Psittaciformes are among the most threatened bird orders 13 . Accordingly, BFDV has been declared a 'key threatening process to biodiversity' by the Australian Government and a Threat Abatement Plan has been established 14,15 . It has furthermore been found in an increasing number of non-psittacine birds [16] [17] [18] . BFDV can be transmitted horizontally through crop secretions, faeces and feather dander 19 , and vertically from mother to embryonated egg 20 . It can cause acute and mostly fatal disease in very young birds, as well as chronic, often fatal disease mostly in older individuals 21 , and has been shown to persist for up to at least seven months in wild host individuals 22 . The risk of severe consequences of infection with BFDV is especially high in small populations of endangered species with low genetic diversity 23-25 .",

In blood samples, we detected BFDV in all age and sex classes of P. e. elegans, and the overall prevalence blood (refers to population prevalence of BFDV in blood samples) was 21.8% (31 of 142 individuals, 95% confidence interval (CI) 15.3 -29.5). When we tested the complete data set (i.e. both breeding and non-breeding birds) we did not find an effect of season on prevalence blood (see Supplementary Table S3 for statistics). We did, however, find significant linear and quadratic effects of date (p = 0.005 and 0.046 respectively, Supplementary Table S3) , indicating fluctuations in BFDV prevalence throughout the year: prevalence blood appeared to be highest after the breeding season (1 st February) and then declined towards the next breeding season (Fig. 1a) . Host sex and age class were also consistently related to prevalence blood , regardless of controlling for season, date, or breeding status. Overall, females (14 of 58, 24.1%, 95% CI 13.9 -37.2) had a higher prevalence than males (13 of 65, 20.0%, 95% CI 11.1 -31.8). However, when accounting for season, date, or breeding status, males were more likely to be infected than females (Supplementary Table S3 Fig. 1b) . When we analysed non-breeding birds only, we found no relationship between prevalence blood and date (p > 0.35) or season (p = 0.35), but the effects of age and sex remained (Supplementary Table S3 ; Fig. 1c ). Mean prevalence blood in young females by season and breeding status is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 and within young birds by age in months in Supplementary Fig. S4 , but sample sizes did not permit further statistical analysis for these age and sex cohorts.",

In wild P. elegans, we show that BFDV appears to be present in the host population year-round. Prevalence and viral load varied across the year, and with breeding status and age. In breeding birds, we found a lower BFDV prevalence in blood samples, and lower viral load in blood samples, compared to birds that we caught outside the breeding season. Previous work by our group found a lower than expected BFDV prevalence within breeding P. elegans pairs; one possible explanation may be that infected individuals might be less likely to breed 35 . In addition, adult P. elegans may be more likely to become infected with BFDV outside of the breeding season because they may be more susceptible after breeding 3 . We provide comparisons of BFDV prevalence during and outside the breeding season, which may suggest, among other explanations, a possible link between infection and the likelihood of breeding.",

            "text": "In our study, we found that BFDV prevalence in both sample types varied with date (i.e. quadratic or cubic date terms, with the cubic date term included where it improved the fit of the model). Prevalence in blood www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ appeared to be highest after the breeding season, in autumn. In cloacal swabs, prevalence seemed to increase after the breeding season and peak in early winter. This later peak in prevalence in cloacal swabs than in blood samples may possibly be due to a delayed onset of viral shedding after a short viraemia 32 . The higher prevalence after the breeding season might be driven by the influx of young birds into the host population following seasonal breeding 32, 36, 37 . In support of this interpretation, we found that young P. elegans had a higher BFDV prevalence in blood than older birds, and a trend towards higher BFDV prevalence in cloacal swabs than the older individuals. Previous studies have also shown that birds under one year of age are particularly likely to get infected with BFDV 33, 38, 39 . Nestlings may be especially likely to contract BFDV because they may get infected by their parents or by contaminated nesting material 27 ; alternatively, they may become infected by conspecifics or interspecific reservoir hosts after the breeding season 37 . In P. elegans, nestlings fledge after five weeks and usually accompany the parents for one to two months 40 . They then form post-breeding flocks until the next breeding season 41 , whereas adult P. elegans usually stay together in pairs and only rarely form large groups with conspecifics 41, 42 . In House Finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), flocking behaviour of young birds has been shown to elevate pathogen prevalence, caused by high contact rates with infected individuals 6 and increased density of susceptible hosts 8 . Young P. elegans might be more susceptible to infections, as their immune system is na\u00efve to the virus. Such an effect, with young birds showing lower seroprevalence, higher pathogen prevalence and more intense shedding of pathogens, and being more likely to be infected, has been shown in several avian host-pathogen systems, for example www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ in young C. mexicanus that were infected with the bacteria-like Mycoplasma gallisepticum 6 , and for infection of wild birds with avian influenza virus 43 . We accounted for host age when testing the effect of date and season, also because our 'non-breeding birds' group contained a higher proportion of young birds than the 'breeding birds' group, as can be seen in Fig. S1 and Table S1. Our findings reinforce the potential importance of targeted management strategies in threatened species infected with BFDV, in order to protect young birds, because they appear particularly susceptible to BFDV infection. We realise that it would be preferable to enter site and year into the analysis of seasonal variation, to validate the seasonal effect across years and geographical regions. In our study, however, BFDV prevalence for some age or sex groups was so low that the models often did not converge, which is why we could only show some of this information in the Supplementary Material. The bigger sample size we have for one of the years of our study could result in stochastic seasonal variation in that single year leading to an interpretation of overall, consistent seasonal effects. Future studies should include year and site when possible.",

In comparison, previous studies have documented a slightly higher prevalence (males 28.3%, females 30.8%) 35 , although those included other subspecies of P. elegans. In P. e. elegans alone, 45% 33 and 34.5% 34 BFDV prevalence was detected previously in blood, which is again higher than the 21.8% we report in this study. One explanation for the differences between studies may be the effect of breeding status: based on the findings reported here, studies would be expected to find a higher prevalence of BFDV if a higher proportion of birds were sampled outside of the breeding season. In addition to the effects of breeding status, flocking behaviour and age (discussed above), seasonal fluctuations in prevalence of wildlife disease may also be influenced by other variables, including weather factors 3 , which can vary across years, so leading to strong inter-annual fluctuations in prevalence. In contrast to the higher prevalence we detected in females, we found males to be more likely to be infected than females when controlling for season, date, breeding status or age, and when testing non-breeding birds only. We think that our analysis of non-breeding birds may be the most reliable, as subadult male P. elegans rarely breed 35 , which can lead to models including breeding birds being quite unbalanced. Including breeding status and age in particular could change the direction of the observed sex effect (females or males more likely to be infected), which should be taken into account when analysing the influence of host sex on BFDV infection. While further research would be desirable, our findings suggest that males may be more likely to be infected with BFDV than females, at least in P. elegans.",

This may indicate that a high proportion of hosts may shed BFDV into the environment, which could have important implications for conservation management. Cloacal swabs are a commonly used method to estimate viral shedding 32, 44 , as BFDV and other pathogens are often transmitted via the faecal-oral route 19, 45 . Additionally, in birds that were BFDV positive in at least one sample type, we found no association between BFDV presence in blood samples and BFDV presence in cloacal swabs. Some viral infections, such as infection with herpes simplex virus 46 , can become latent, usually after an active phase, and the viruses are then only detectable in certain tissues where they persist until re-activation. BFDV can be undetectable in blood during latent phases of infection, but may still be detectable in the cloaca 32, 47 . Positive cloacal swab results in birds with BFDV-negative blood may result from viral persistence within the Bursa of Fabricius, which sits near the cloaca and is one of the main sites of BFDV replication 32, 48, 49 . On the other hand, birds that are BFDV positive in blood only, but not in cloacal swabs, may be in the early stages of infection, before occurrence of viral shedding 47 . Additionally, a small percentage of the BFDV positives in blood may represent remnant viral DNA from previous infections. It is however thought that the majority of BFDV positives in blood represent active viral infection 35 , and the qPCR detection assay we used is a very widely used method for investigations of BFDV prevalence 33, 50 . Cloacal swabs have not been subject to the same level of validation as blood samples for BFDV detection, and cloacal results should therefore be interpreted more cautiously than blood samples. To confirm that the BFDV DNA detected in cloacal swabs is indeed viable virus, and not viral DNA fragments excreted after ingestion, future studies considering shedding of BFDV would benefit from including haemagglutination assays for antigen detection in faecal or feather samples 31 , or sequencing of BFDV-positive swabs, as has been done for blood samples 33 . Our results are, however, in accordance with other studies showing that BFDV 32 and other circoviruses 48 can be detected in the cloaca even while not being detectable in blood. As BFDV is thought to be highly stable in the environment 27 , prolonged periods of virus shedding may lead to high levels of environmental contamination. While we cannot fully exclude false negative results due to the much lower DNA yield from swabs than from blood, or false positives due to contamination from feathers surrounding the cloaca, our results suggest that BFDV presence can be missed in subjects if one only tests for active infection in blood.",

Here we discuss that BFDV prevalence in natural P. elegans populations can show seasonal variation, with a possible peak prevalence in blood samples occurring after breeding. Our data suggest that this variation may be mainly influenced by changes in host breeding status and the influx of young birds into the population, a finding consistent with studies on other avian pathogens. We detected BFDV in a large proportion of the cloacal swabs we analysed, suggesting that wild hosts might shed the virus over extended periods of time, although swabs should be subject to further validation. Based on our and other data, which show highest prevalence and load in young birds, as well as a higher Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:7894 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64631-y www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ prevalence blood outside of the breeding season, we conclude that, in P. elegans at least, the high-risk time for BFDV infection and transmission might be during and after the breeding season, when young, susceptible host individuals enter the population and subsequently flock together. Accordingly, our findings suggest consideration of targeted BFDV management aimed at the protection of young hosts, at least in threatened or vulnerable species. Future studies should test whether the pattern we find in P. elegans is found in other avian hosts of BFDV, and across additional geographical regions and years.",

The extracted DNA was stored in low Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris.HCL, 0.1 mM EDTA; pH 7.5 -8.0) at -20 \u00b0C 34 . We determined DNA quality and quantity using a DU 640B spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, CA, U.S.A.) with a 1: 200 dilution. We sexed birds using a modified PCR protocol by Griffiths, et al. 61 . For BFDV detection, we diluted DNA to the same concentration (200 ng/\u00b5l), and then used a probe-based quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) method 34 . We ran the assay using a PikoReal Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MA, U.S.A.). We added positive and no-template controls to each qPCR plate, and all samples were run in duplicate. Duplicate samples with Cq values (cycle at which probe fluorescence crosses the arbitrarily set detection baseline) differing by more than one cycle were run again. Although the qPCR method amplifies a shorter fragment of viral DNA than conventional PCR, it has been shown to deliver comparable results, while being more sensitive than the conventional assay 34 . qPCR is a widely used method for BFDV surveillance 50 . As most positives detected by qPCR represent active infection with viable virus as confirmed by sequencing 33 , but some can be non-active remnant viral DNA, we define prevalence as the percentage of individuals positive for BFDV viral DNA 35 . BFDV-positive (BFDV+) birds are termed either BFDV+ blood or BFDV+ cloacal , depending on which sample type was positive for BFDV presence. Samples that were BFDV-negative are termed BFDV\u2212 blood or BFDV\u2212 cloacal .",

We carried out statistical analyses using SPSS 25.01 (IBM, Armonk NY, U.S.A.). To ensure independence of cases, we used only data from the first capture if individuals were recaptured. We pooled the data from our two years of study and from the three field sites, because we found overlapping confidence intervals between years and sites during initial data analysis ( Supplementary Fig. S6) . Additionally, Eastwood, et al. 33 found that in P. elegans, geographic location, host density and parrot community diversity and composition do not explain differences in BFDV prevalence or load. A very low BFDV prevalence in some sex/age groups did not permit us to include year and trapping site as random intercepts, as well as age and sex in the same model, as the models did not converge. When we ran site and year separately as main effects in the full models, they were not significant, while we still found effects of age, date and sex (Supplementary Tables S7 -S10). We combined two of our three field sites, namely Meredith/She Oaks and Steiglitz, for statistical analysis. The two sites are located within 10 km of each other. Data from previous studies show that most recaptured P. elegans were trapped or resighted within approximately 10 km of their banding site 54, 63 . We therefore defined Meredith/She Oaks and Steiglitz as one P. elegans population. We are aware that due to different and sometimes low sample sizes of infected birds trapped in some years and sites, and the resulting grouping of years and sites for most of our analyses, some of the observed seasonal patterns may in fact be stochastic effects. We address this in the discussion.",

We analysed date as a continuous variable in addition to season, because grouping samples by season can result in samples that were in fact collected close together being assigned to different seasons, potentially leading to unreliable results (for example, a bird trapped on the 31 st May would be in the autumn group, but a bird trapped one day later would be in the winter group). Both season (as a categorical predictor) and date (as a continuous predictor) are common methods for investigating seasonal effects 64, 66 . Seasons were defined as follows: Spring: 1 st September to 30 th November; summer: 1 st December to 28 th February; autumn: 1 st March to 31 st May; winter: 1 st June to 31 st August. Season was included as an ordinal variable (season 1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = autumn, 4 = winter). During exploratory data analysis we ran the same models using season as either ordinal or nominal variable, which led to identical results. Julian date was set to day one on the 1 st February, to represent a biologically significant date 67 , i.e. the end of the breeding season of P. elegans in our study area 35 . During exploratory data analysis, we also tested 1 st January (start of the year) and 1 st September (beginning of the breeding season) as Julian day 1. Between the three examples of Julian day 1, the resulting R 2 , AICc and p-values were very similar (Supplementary Table S11 ); we therefore only report results based on 1 st February as day 1. We centred Julian date to avoid collinearity, and tested linear, quadratic and cubic date predictors. For blood samples, models with quadratic date terms showed better fit (based on AICc and Nagelkerke R 2 ) than models with cubic as well as quadratic date terms (data not shown). For body condition and body mass, models had almost identical fit with and without the cubic date terms. We therefore chose to use the most parsimonious models and for blood samples, body condition and body mass, we report model outputs without the cubic date term. For cloacal swabs and when testing our complete data set of P. elegans, models including cubic as well as quadratic date terms showed better fit than models that included only quadratic terms. We thus report results based on these models (Supplementary Table S4 ). Additional predictors we used were host traits that have previously been shown to influence BFDV infection (age class and sex) 56 . After performing GLMs on the full data set, we also tested seasonal effects separately in subsets of breeding and non-breeding birds, as date and breeding status were correlated. Nine birds which were caught in walk-in traps during the breeding season were excluded from analyses comparing breeding and non-breeding birds, as we could not determine whether or not they were breeding at the time of capture. Sample size thus varies between models, and also because of missing information for some predictors for some individual birds.",
