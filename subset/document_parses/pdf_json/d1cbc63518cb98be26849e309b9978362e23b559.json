A crisis that affects the community, from natural disaster to mass casualty event to infectious disease outbreak, can have a profound and enduring effect on its healthcare systems and training programs. Events, such as Hurricane Katrina, the Pulse Nightclub shooting, and the recent explosion in Beirut, demonstrate the vulnerability of training programs to respond to these crises and to adequately deal with the aftermath. 1 Studies have shown that 30% of surgical residents who responded to the Pulse Nightclub shooting in 2016 suffered from burnout, major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder for months after the event. 1 Pandemics create unprecedented public health challenges that require comprehensive and coordinated responses from health care systems and can, thereby, cause substantial and prolonged disruption to residency training. 2 The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted medical education worldwide. There is a large and growing literature documenting the challenges faced by training programs, including cancellation of elective procedures, loss of clinical and operative experience, increased tele-medicine with less hands on clinical care, redeployment to non-specialty services, and rapid and complete transition to virtual learning. [3] [4] [5] Moreover, trainees describe significant stress and anxiety related to the pandemic's effects on their personal and professional lives. 3, 6 A study of medical and surgical residents in a large urban academic center in the United States showed that 50% of the respondents thought that the COVID-19 pandemic had affected their medical experience negatively, but that their experience could be compensated in the future. 3 Academic medical centers have a responsibility to provide care to large surges of COVID-19 patients, whilst mitigating disruptions to education and ensuring resident safety and wellbeing. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has encouraged a multi-pronged approach to supporting residents during the pandemic. Key target areas include (1) meeting the basic physical needs of trainees;",

In Singapore, lessons learned from prior experiences with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks enabled the rapid development of a \"pandemic response team\" that enabled an efficient and systematic approach to help minimize education disruption, while prioritizing transparency and trainee wellbeing. 8 In an academic medical center in the Midwest United States, trained psychiatry residents provided easily accessible, on demand peer support. With the support of faculty supervisors, the residents offered counseling to other trainees dealing with the chronic stress of working as frontline physicians during the pandemic. 9 To date, however, there is limited literature on the effectiveness of these interventions, and resident reactions to these contingency plans remains largely unknown. 3 As internal medicine residents serving on the frontlines of a COVID-19 designated government hospital in the United Arab Emirates, we also faced significant challenges and uncertainties during the pandemic. We have worked extra shifts and extended hours and provided care under highly stressful conditions for many months. Our electives and vacations were indefinitely postponed and academic sessions cancelled or transitioned to virtual learning activities. Board examinations were postponed and changed in structure. The sheer clinical volume and social distancing restrictions translated into less time for formal teaching and the near disappearance of bedside rounds. The surge in patient volume and acuity mandated that even junior residents cared for large numbers of critically ill patients. The uncertainty of this novel virus meant that, for the first time in our training, we were on the same learning curve as our faculty and could no longer rely on their trusted expertise. The emotional and physical exhaustion brought on by this experience is undeniable, and compounded by the physical isolation from family members and the personal trauma of experiencing the illness of family, friends and colleagues. Despite these challenges, we recognize the important role we played in our institution's COVID-19 response. We are proud of our continued commitment to patient care, and know that we have witnessed true professionalism and resilience in our colleagues and in ourselves.",

It is essential to provide residents with different outlets for counseling and support. In addition to group de-briefing sessions conducted by mental health and trauma experts, we have access to individual confidential counseling. Psychiatry residents in our institution operate a 24/7 psychological support hotline. Weekly online yoga classes are available for all healthcare workers. An easily implementable change is the provision of healthy, accessible daily meals. Onsite gyms, relaxation spaces in the hospital and mindfulness training are other interventions that can help reduce resident stress. Also, residents are encouraged to take time off whenever possible to limit fatigue and re-energize.

Chief residents served a unique additional leadership role, operating as liaisons between the program directors and the residents.

In supporting learning during these times, residency programs have adopted flexible scheduling, focused on frequent and transparent communication, incorporated different strategies to build community and promote psychological wellbeing, and advanced virtual teaching modalities. We are hopeful that these interventions will be long lasting. This pandemic will undoubtedly be a defining moment in our careers and our lives. We not only learned to be better physicians; the experience has made us better human beings. We shared the same fears and worries of our patients and their families and became more compassionate; we grew more patient, flexible and understanding. We were taught important lessons in courage and teamwork. COVID-19 is not the first, and will certainly not be the last, major health emergency that we will encounter in our careers as health professionals. The COVID-19 pandemic may indeed be a transformative event in medical education. From this experience, we have learned not to fear the unknown, but to grow from the process and rebuild stronger.",
