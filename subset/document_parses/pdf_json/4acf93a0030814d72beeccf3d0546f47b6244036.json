Despite its limitations, notably a 'healthy donor' effect, it seems plausible that these estimates are reasonably generalisable to actual population level anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, but should be further verified.",

The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay appears to have particularly good durability of antibody detection for months post PCR reversion and symptom resolution, with no evidence of antibody waning and seroreversion over more than four months in a US COVID-19 convalescent plasma cohort (personal communication, M. Busch). \u2022 We ignore, for now, the effects of 1) the donor deferral rule that people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, or COVID-19-like symptoms, are precluded from donation for a period of two weeks after PCR test and symptom resolution, and 2) deferral of regular donors who were in quarantine due to a positive contact who would not have presented for their routine donation.

Although we are not aware of any biological basis for expecting racial differences -in South Africa, as elsewhere, race is, for historical reasons, a strong correlate of socio-economic status, living conditions, and social circumstances, and therefore a suspected predictor of prevalence.

Figure 4 shows the seroprevalence estimates by the remaining meaningful disaggregation -race and province. The large difference by both race and province are highly statistically significant as well as epidemiologically meaningful. We also show the race-weighted overall provincial prevalence estimates (which we interpret as provincial 'attack rates'), and the official prevalence of having been diagnosed, based on reporting of positive PCR diagnostic test results to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (6). Table 1 shows our provincial estimates of attack rates, as a percentage; the implied number of infections; the number of laboratory confirmed cases according to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) (6) which reports on testing performed both in the private and public sector; and the (multiplicative) discrepancy between our estimate and the official count. Note that our estimated number of infections is conservatively based on our estimated prevalence being applied only to the age group 15-69, so these factors are not quite as large as implied by Figure 4 . The estimated seroprevalence ranges from 31.8% in NC to 62.5% in the EC and is at least 8 fold higher than the official case count.",

Firstly, Black and White donors each account for roughly half the total participants of this study, though South Africa's population is about 80 percent Black African and only 8 percent White/European (4). Other population groups are generally insignificantly small except Asian in Kwazulu-Natal (about 20%) and Coloured in the Western Cape (about 50%). Furthermore, repeat blood donors (who supply the majority of donations) are pre-selected to have recently been negative for pathogens included in routine blood safety screening. In South Africa this selection for being HIV negative is certainly relevant, given the country's extraordinary HIV prevalence. Communities which are economically stressed, or without ease of access to blood donor centres, will be under-represented among the study population.",

Deferral rules based on confirmed infection or COVID-19-like symptoms should slightly depress seroprevalence estimates relative to 'true' prevalence. The age weighting we adopted to estimate total infections also produces a face value underestimate for population totals as it assigns no cases in the age range 0-14, which accounts for about 30 percent of the population. The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay appears to have particularly good detection sensitivity for months post PCR reversion (9) , though there may be some seroreversion. Therefore, while further investigation of the issue of representativeness will clearly need to be done, our estimates are subject to downward bias by at least some obvious considerations.",
