It was discovered in Wuhan, China and then began spreading around the world, impacting the health of millions. Efforts for treatment have been hampered as there are no antiviral drugs that are effective against this virus. In the present study, we have explored the phytochemical constituents of Salvia plebeia R. Br., in terms of its binding affinity by targeting COVID-19 main protease (M pro ) using computational analysis. Molecular docking analysis was performed using PyRx software. The ADMET and drug-likeness properties of the top 10 compounds showing binding affinity greater than or equal to \u2212 8.0 kcal/mol were analysed using pkCSM and DruLiTo, respectively. Based on the docking studies, it was confirmed that Rutin and Plebeiosides B were the most potent inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 with the best binding affinities of \u2212 9.1 kcal/mol and \u2212 8.9 kcal/mol, respectively. Further, the two compounds were analysed by studying their biological activity using the PASS webserver. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis was performed for the selected protein-ligand complexes to confirm their stability at 300 ns. MM-PBSA provided the basis for analyzing the affinity of the phytochemicals towards M pro by calculating the binding energy, and secondary structure analysis indicated the stability of protease structure when it is bound to Rutin and Plebeiosides B. Altogether, the study identifies Rutin and Plebeiosides B to be potent M pro inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.",

On February 12, 2020, the WHO proceeded to name the disease \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (COVID-19) and on March 11, 2020, they declared the outbreak a global pandemic. On conducting a whole viral genome evaluation, it was found that 88% of the viral sequence identity was shared with two SARS-like coronaviruses obtained from bats. This led to it being named \"SARS coronavirus 2\", primarily based on the taxonomy and phylogeny (Fauci et al. 2020; Ranney et al. 2020) . The Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a part of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, which belongs to the family Coronaviridae, coming under the order Nidovirales. Orthocoronavirinae has 4 genera within it, that is, Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1-CoV), Betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoV), Gammacoronavirus (\u03b3-CoV) and Deltacoronavirus (\u03b4-CoV) (Li et al. 2020) . The Coronaviruses are positively stranded RNA, enveloped viruses (Xiu et al. 2020) . Mammals have been shown to be affected by \u03b1-CoV and \u03b2-CoV genera, and on the other hand, birds are known to be affected by \u03b3-CoV and \u03b4-CoV genera (Amin and Jha 2020) .",

An important process is the breakdown of the multidomain, viral polyprotein into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps). These individual proteins combine to form complexes that carry out the synthesis of viral RNA (Kandeel et al. 2020; Naidoo et al. 2020) . Along with these non-structural proteins, the SARS-CoV-2 further possesses four structural proteins, namely the Spike surface glycoprotein, the membrane protein, the envelope protein and the nucleocapsid protein. These are all required for the infection and assembly of the virus (Li et al. 2020) . When the virus is inhaled, the spike proteins help it interact with the epithelial cells by binding to the human receptor, ACE2. The virus then proceeds to proliferate and enter into the alveolar epithelial cells. This, in turn, triggers a vigorous immune response leading to cytokine storm syndromes as well as damage to the pulmonary tissue (Li et al. 2020; Mason 2020) .",

            "text": "Main protease (M pro ) is an enzyme of great importance to the coronaviruses as it plays a crucial part in the replication of the virus and transcription. This functional significance of M pro in the life cycle of the virus, along with the lack of any similarly related homologues in humans, has identified it as an attractive target for the development of medication against SARS-CoV-2. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro complexed with N3 is found in PDB (PDB ID: 6LU7) and it provides a basis to identify potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 M pro , with the help of virtual screening. From the literature, it can be seen that N3 is a Michael acceptor inhibitor that can inhibit M pro from a range of coronaviruses like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and also displays potent antiviral activity. From the crystal structure of M pro it was seen that it comprises protomers A and B which associate to form a dimer and each protomer consists of three domains. The residues of the active site of M pro are conserved and make a catalytic Cys145-His41 dyad. N3 binds in the substrate-binding pocket situated in a cleft in the middle of domain I and domain II. The amino acid residues involved in the specific interactions of N3 with M pro include Phe140, Cys145, Glu166, Leu4, Val3, Ala2, His172, Leu167, Asn142, His163, Met49, Leu141, His41, Met165, Tyr54, Gln192, Asp187, Phe185, Thr25, Gln189, Thr24 and Pro168 (Jin et al. 2020) .",

One of the potential methods of treatment that is currently being looked into by researchers is drug repurposing, which is also referred to as drug reprofiling or drug repositioning, where drugs that were intended as a treatment against other diseases or similar viruses (SARS and MERS) are used as a treatment against COVID-19. While this method substantially decreases the time it would have taken for the development of a new drug, drug repurposing does also pose certain challenges such as the absence of patent protection, establishment of the efficacy, demonstration of its safety and in certain cases the continuous need for risky and expensive trials (Nurton 2020; Pushpakom et al. 2018; Shineman et al. 2014; Talevi and Bellera 2020) . Problems faced by synthetic or synthetically derived drugs such as harmful side effects and antibiotic resistance in the case of antibiotics, lead to the shift towards natural remedies. Herbal drug preparations, obtained from biologically active products, have been an important part of traditional medicine. The compounds obtained from natural products are known to be pharmacophores and possess certain properties, such as high stereochemistry and metabolite-likeness that make them ideal as alternative medicines (Marathe and Datey 2012; Harvey et al. 2015; Ngane et al. 2011; Veeresham 2012) .",

The SPC water model was used to carry out the solvation procedure by using the gmx solvate tool. The electroneutralization of the system was carried out with the tool gmxgenion. To optimize the structure and remove the steric clashes, energy minimization was done. The system was then calibrated by implementing two steps. The NVT equilibration's first step lasted for 100 picoseconds. The system's temperature was stabilised by heating the system to 300 K. The NPT ensemble's second step lasted for 100 picoseconds. The stabilization of pressure and density of the system was then carried out.

An ideal oral drug should be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, distributed to the target specifically, metabolized without eliminating its property and removed without any damage. The dynamic movements of the chemical structures during their passage through the body and their relation to physiological parameters helps us in understanding the pharmacokinetic properties (Gibaldi and Levy 1976) . To understand these properties, the skin-permeability coefficient (logKp), apparent Caco-2 and MDCK were computed. The absorption level of the compounds can be anticipated using water solubility, Caco-2 permeability, skin permeability, intestinal absorption (human), and P-glycoprotein substrate or inhibitor. All ligands are found to be sparingly soluble in water. CaCo-2 permeability value greater than 0.9 indicates high permeability. All the compounds have shown a high permeability, except for rutin, cymaroside, 6 hydroxyluteolin 7 glucoside, plebeiosides B, plebeiosides A, salviaplebeiaside, rosmarinic acid and 6\u2033-O-acetylhomoplantaginin. About skin permeability, log Kp > \u2212 2.5 shows low skin permeability. Skin permeability is an important consideration for dermal drug delivery (Pires et al. 2015) . All the compounds have shown good skin permeability. For intestinal absorption (humans), a value below 30% is associated with poor absorption. All the compounds have shown acceptable absorption, except rutin (23.446%). P-glycoprotein belongs to the ATP-binding transmembrane glycoprotein family [ATP-binding cassette (ABC)], which is found to be associated with the excretion of drugs or other exogenic chemicals from cells. The results suggest that all the compounds are substrates of P-Glycoprotein except Aflatoxin B2. Neocafhispidulin and salviaplebeiaside were found to be a P-glycoprotein I inhibitor. Neocafhispidulin was anticipated to be a P-glycoprotein II inhibitor.",

When VDss is lesser than 0.71 L kg \u22121 (log VDss < \u2212 0.15), the volume of distribution is contemplated to be relatively low which indicates that the drug tends to remain in the plasma. When VDss is more than 2.81 L kg \u22121 (log VDss > 0.45), the volume of distribution is examined to be relatively more which indicates that the drug has the propensity to exit the plasma and pass into the body's extravascular compartments (Mansoor and Mahabadi 2021). Neocafhispidulin, plebeiosides B, plebeiosides A, salviaplebeiaside, rosmarinic acid, 6\u2033-O-acetylhomoplantaginin, Aflatoxin B2 showed relatively low distribution volumes. Rutin, cynaroside and 6 hydroxyluteolin 7 glucoside showed moderate values of distribution volume.

LogBB value lower than \u2212 1 suggests that the compounds do not easily traverse the blood-brain barrier. None of the compounds were found to traverse the blood-brain barrier easily indicating that the ligands express fairly minimal side effects and toxicity to the brain.

MM-PBSA can be used to perceive the contribution of amino acid residues within the active site to the structural stability of ligands and binding free energy throughout the simulation period (Kumar and Pandey 2013) . MM-PBSA calculates absolute binding free energies that are the sum of the electrostatic interaction, polar solvation free energy, van der Waals interaction and nonpolar solvation free energy. The predicted energy components for the binding of Rutin and Plebeiosides B with main protease are summarised in Table 5 . From the results, it is observed that electrostatic, SASA and van der Waals energy has a negative contribution to the total interaction energy and the polar solvation energy has a positive contribution to the total binding energy. The van der Waals interaction's contribution between the protein and ligands is larger in magnitude and the SASA's contribution is comparatively less. A high negative value of van der Waals energy indicates the massive hydrophobic interactions between the ligands and the main protease ). The total binding energies of Rutin and Plebeiosides B are found to be \u2212 75.100 \u00b1 21.854 kJ/mol and \u2212 121.182 \u00b1 20.640 kJ/mol, respectively.

            "text": "Secondary structure analysis Structural changes during the simulation were studied to observe the evolution in the 3D structure of the complex by comparing 4 snapshots of the protein-ligand complexes (Fig. 3) . From the overall secondary structure analysis, it is observed that the protease structure remains conserved and shows minimal changes throughout the 300 ns simulation period, which shows the stability of the protease-ligand complexes. Figure 4 and Table 6 display the secondary structural analysis of the apoprotein (M pro ) as well as that of the M pro -ligand complexes on the whole. The percentage of A-Helices/B-Sheets in the secondary structure determine its structural rigidity and the percentage of coils/turns found within the structure determine its flexibility. When M pro binds to Rutin and Plebeiosides B, marginal structural changes were observed. Rutin showed a slightly greater percentage of coils and \u03b1-helix in comparison to the Plebeiosides B docked complex and the apo protein. The Plebeiosides B docked complex showed the same percentage of secondary structure elements as the apo-protein. Based on previous studies, rutin has shown anticancer/ antineoplastic effects, antimicrobial activity and antiviral activity (Araruna et al. 2012; Lin et al. 2009 ). Sodium rutin sulfate which is a sulfated rutin analogue, was previously studied for its anti-HIV activity against HIV-1 X 4 viruses IIIB, HIV-1 R5 isolates Ada-M and Ba-L strains (Tao et al. 2007 ). Plebeiosides B is a relatively newly isolated benzoylated monoterpene glycoside. This compound has been found to be structurally similar to salviaplebeiaside, isolated from S. plebeia and (1R,2S,4R,7S)-vicodiol 9-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside that was isolated from Amomum xanthioides. Such camphane monoterpenes are generally found in essential oils such as citronella oil, valerian, turpentine and so on (Bang et al. 2016) . Monoterpenoids are widely found in the aerial parts of the plant like leaves and flowers, and are the most important components of naturally occurring volatile products (Ghasemnezhad et al. 2020) . However, as Plebeiosides B is a relatively novel compound and has not been studied extensively, further studies would be required to confirm the activities identified through in silico studies.",

A library of the 208 compounds identified was scrutinized by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies which led to the identification of Rutin and Plebeiosides B which showed maximum inhibitory activity against M pro . The protein-ligand interactions displayed that hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, electrostatic, polar and non-polar interactions played key roles in the contribution of the interactions at the active pocket of the protein. The compounds showed strong affinity towards the target and the analysis of the ADMET properties, biological activities, as well as drug-likeness properties, showed that they could be effective potential drug molecules against SARS-CoV-2.

It can be seen that apo-M pro and the complexes show slight fluctuations up to 150 ns and have got the equilibration state thereafter. The average RMSD values for apo-M pro , M pro -Rutin and M pro -Plebeiosides B is found to be 0.152 nm, 0.147 nm and 0.218 nm, respectively. The M pro -Plebeiosides B complex has shown a comparatively greater RMSD value from 150 ns onwards. It has a constant RMSD of 0.35 nm for 150 ns and has suddenly risen to a value of 0.5 nm during 150-300 ns. The apo-M pro and the M pro -Rutin complexes have maintained a constant RMSD value of 0.3 nm.

In both the complexes i.e., M pro -Rutin and M pro -Plebeiosides B, the fluctuations of C\u03b1 atoms of the protein were comparatively more in domain I and domain III and the amino acid residues which interacted with the ligands during docking exhibited minimal fluctuation values. Most importantly, the catalytic dyad residues (Cys145 and His41) which interacted with both the ligands during docking, fluctuated less. The average RMSF values of apo-M pro , M pro -Rutin and M pro -Plebeiosides B complexes were calculated to be 0.81 nm,Fig. 2The plots of molecular dynamics simulations for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) in complex with the ligands, Rutin and Plebeiosides B, obtained from Salvia plebeia during 300 ns simulation. a The root mean square deviation (RMSD) plot for the complexes. b",
