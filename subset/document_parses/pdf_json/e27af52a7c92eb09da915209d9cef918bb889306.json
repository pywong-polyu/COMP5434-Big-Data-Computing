This free-access educational website delivers asynchronous highquality multidisciplinary critical care education targeted at critical care trainees. The lectures, presented in real time on-site, are recorded and available on the website or as a podcast on iTunes or Android. Thus, the curriculum can be easily accessed around the world. Objective: We sought to identify the impact this website has on current and former University of Maryland critical care trainees. Methods: A 32-question survey was generated using a standard survey generation tool. The survey was e-mailed in the fall of 2019 to the University of Maryland Multi-Departmental Critical Care current and graduated trainees from the prior 7 years. Survey data were collected through December 2019. The questions focused on user demographics, overall experience with the website, scope of website use, and clinical application of the content. Anonymous responses were electronically gathered. Results: A total of 186 current trainees and graduates were surveyed, with a 39% (n = 72) response rate. Of responders, 76% (55) use the website for ongoing medical education. The majority use the website at least monthly. Most users (63%, n = 35) access the lectures directly through the website. All 55 current users agree that the website has improved their medical knowledge and is a useful education resource. Platform use has increased and includes users from around the world. Conclusion: Based on our current data, the MarylandCCProject remains a valuable and highly used educational resource, impacting patient care both during and after critical care fellowship training.",

            "text": "Despite vast technological advancements over the past century, traditional models of postgraduate medical education using clinical experience and in-person didactic instruction have remained the foundation of most training programs and have been largely unchanged. Busy clinical responsibilities, work schedules modified to comply with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty hour requirements, off-campus rotations, and, most recently, pandemic-induced shifts toward virtual learning have challenged trainees' availability for in-person education. Concurrently, mounting pressure exists on faculty to increase clinical productivity, leaving less time available dedicated to teaching (1) . As a result, postgraduate training programs must identify and implement innovative teaching methods outside the confines of the physical classroom to offer asynchronous education adaptable to the time constraints of the learner.",

The curriculum is regularly updated to account for changes in practice guidelines, featuring evolving and novel topics in critical care (e.g., vaping-induced lung injury, coronavirus disease updates) from speakers across the world representing a multitude of clinical backgrounds. The lectures, usually presented in real time at the University of Maryland, are recorded and made available free of charge on the MarylandCCProject website or as a podcast on iTunes or Android. The lectures are readily accessible across both desktop and mobile platforms, and the website features a user-friendly search function. In this way, this state-ofthe-art multidisciplinary curriculum can be accessed throughout the globe to anyone with an Internet connection. The educational site received the Innovations in Fellowship Education award at the 2014 Annual Meeting of the American Thoracic Society (2) . To justify the requisite ongoing maintenance and innovation invested in the website, we sought to better understand its impact on trainees. We hypothesized that Maryland.CCProject.com positively impacts critical care trainees' clinical practice and medical education, such that trainees would continue to use the site even after graduation.",

Professional societies provide an array of online educational materials, created by credible teachers and peer-reviewed but often at significant cost to the learner. The use of free open-access medical education has greatly increased in recent years, partially as a response to the high cost of society-based educational materials. In 2002, fewer than 10 websites, blogs, and podcasts dedicated to critical care education existed. In contrast, more than 180 emergency medicine and critical care websites, 140 blogs, and 40 podcasts were online in 2013 (3).",

When reviewing our website usage data, several patterns emerge. New users and website hits steadily increased over time through 2018, which is not explained by retained or return users based on the volumes seen. This may reflect a growing interest in free educational content and would be consistent with the recognized increase in demand for web-based educational resources by trainees (9) . Although we are limited in our ability to fully assess the reason for the slight decline in website hits and new users in 2019, one possibility would be that the aforementioned and continued growth of free online educational content has begun to result in a dilution of the potential audience across multiple platforms. Another possibility is that there was a simple decrease in search enginedirected traffic to the MarylandCCProject platform for 2019. Further longitudinal study and data collection may provide more insight.",

High use in LMICs demonstrates that high-quality, free educational content is of value to users in a wide variety of clinical care environments, greatly increasing the potential of this platform to positively impact care delivery globally. Our data suggest that our audience most frequently used videos and summary documents. Interestingly, respondents preferred audio recordings over lecture summaries despite using the summaries more often.

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, a significant proportion of the respondents to our survey were from current fellows (23.6%, n = 17). Although seemingly a source for potential bias in respondents who could hesitate to provide critical feedback, the anonymous nature of the survey should have sufficiently mitigated this risk. Moreover, because these participants represent a demographic of great interest for this study, their high response rate is preferred. Current fellows are likely highly motivated to interact with the platform when clinical duties interfere with their ability to attend in-person lectures, and their lack of clinical experience and topic mastery demands more intensive learning effectively integrated into their busy schedules. They may also be motivated by an impending high-stakes board examination within the following 1-3 years (whereas former fellows taking the survey were unlikely to need to take their board exams for at least another 5 yr). Second, the majority of the respondents to our survey were male (70.8%, n = 51), which correlates with our fellowship demographics historically for the time period of fellows who were surveyed. This may limit the generalizability of these results, as women increasingly apply for critical care fellowships and this ratio now approaches 1:1. Another weakness is that this study is a survey analysis that contains no objective measures.",

            "text": "Perhaps the most significant limitation of this study is that only 39% of our identified study subjects responded to the survey, which introduces concern for selfselection or nonresponse bias. Although it is unknown if survey nonresponders use the platform, it is possible that the lack of response to an e-mail with \"MarylandCCProject\" in the subject line indicates that the recipient does not use the platform regularly. This would set up a a different demographic with variable traits compared with nonresponders and could limit the generalizability of the study. Although a low survey response rate limits the conclusions that can be generated, it is still possible to gather useful data for improving the educational value of the platform and improving future surveys. This is particularly true if active users are those most likely to respond and nonresponders can generally be assumed to be less likely to use the platform. Future studies should work to improve the participant response rate and could correlate participants' survey responses with more objective measures of job performance or critical care knowledge.",
