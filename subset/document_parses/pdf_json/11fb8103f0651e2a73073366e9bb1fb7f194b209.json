Functional screening of effector candidates using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression assay in Nicotiana benthamiana identified two virulence-related effectors, named SIB1 and SIB2 (Suppression of Immunity in N. benthamiana), of an anthracnose fungus Colletotrichum orbiculare, which infects both cucurbits and N. benthamiana. The Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of SIB1 or SIB2 increased the susceptibility of N. benthamiana to C. orbiculare, which suggested these effectors can suppress immune responses in N. benthamiana. The presence of SIB1 and SIB2 homologs was found to be limited to the genus Colletotrichum. SIB1 suppressed both (i) the generation of reactive oxygen species triggered by two different pathogen-associated molecular patterns, chitin and flg22, and (ii) the cell death response triggered by the Phytophthora infestans INF1 elicitin in N. benthamiana. We determined the NMR-based structure of SIB1 to obtain its structural insights. The three-dimensional structure of SIB1 comprises five \u03b2-strands, each containing three disulfide bonds. The overall conformation was found to be a cylindrical shape, such as the well-known antiparallel \u03b2-barrel structure. However, the \u03b2-strands were found to display a unique topology, one pair of these \u03b2-strands formed a parallel \u03b2-sheet. These results suggest that the effector SIB1 present in Colletotrichum fungi has unique structural features and can suppress pathogen-associated molecular patterntriggered immunity in N. benthamiana.",

As the first layer of plant defense, plants recognize conserved components of microbes called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are often present on their external face. Plant recognition of PAMPs triggers pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Although the plant immune system against most potential pathogenic microbes, especially nonadapted pathogens, is thought to depend mainly on PTI, adapted pathogens have evolved various mechanisms to suppress PTI (3) . The secreted virulence factors, called effectors, play important roles in the suppression of PTI. In response to a pathogen's use of effectors to try to suppress PTI, plants actuate their second layer of defense, called effectortriggered immunity (4) . Effector-triggered immunity induces strong and robust immune responses that are typically associated with programmed cell death (PCD), a response referred to as the hypersensitive response (HR).",

In general, Colletotrichum fungi develop a specialized infection structure called appressorium that is darkly pigmented with melanin, and melanized appressorium is important for host penetration (8, 9) .

We previously reported on the virulence-related effectors NIS1 and CoDN3 of C. orbiculare that are preferentially expressed in the biotrophic phase (15, 16) . We revealed that the expression of NIS1 leads to PCD in N. benthamiana, and that the NIS1-triggered PCD is suppressed by CoDN3 expression (16) . CoDN3 also inhibits PCD in N. benthamiana induced by another C. orbiculare effector NLP1 (17) . We recently reported that NIS1 targets Arabidopsis thaliana BAK1 and BIK1, which function in PAMP recognition and subsequent PTI activation, together with pattern recognition receptors that sense particular PAMPs (18) .",

However, melanized appressoria of the adapted Colletotrichum fungus develop invasive hyphae successfully, whereas those of nonadapted Colletotrichum fungi fail to develop invasive hyphae because Arabidopsis plants activate a preinvasive defense (19) . The finding therefore suggested that melanized appressoria of Colletotrichum fungi likely secrete effectors that are critical for the suppression of preinvasive plant defense. Consistently, microarray-based expression analysis of C. orbiculare inoculated on N. benthamiana shows that many small and secreted protein genes are highly expressed at 1 dpi, when the pathogen has developed melanized appressoria but has not yet formed invasive hyphae (5) .",

Using the newly obtained RNA sequence data derived from N. benthamiana inoculated with C. orbiculare at 1 dpi, we selected candidate effector-like genes of C. orbiculare and subjected them to a functional screening assay via Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression. Each candidate was transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves that were subsequently challenged with C. orbiculare to assess each candidate's ability to suppress the immunity of N. benthamiana. In these experiments, we identified two novel virulence-related effectors, named SIB1 and SIB2 (Suppression of Immunity in N. benthamiana), that suppressed N. benthamiana immunity against C. orbiculare. We then performed further characterization of SIB1. Transient expression of SIB1 suppressed both (i) the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by two different PAMPs, chitin and flg22, and (ii) the cell death response triggered by the Phytophthora infestans INF1 elicitin. We next determined the tertiary structure of SIB1 to obtain structural insights into this effector. Using NMR analysis, we have solved the tertiary structure of SIB1, which showed that the effector SIB1 of C. orbiculare has unique structural features.",

It was recently reported that the NIS1 of C. orbiculare and an NIS1 homolog of Magnaporthe oryzae (MoNIS1) commonly suppress ROS production triggered by both chitin and flg22 in Figure 1 . Transient expression of the effector SIB1 or SIB2 in Nicotiana benthamiana decreased immunity to Colletotrichum orbiculare. A, increased lesion development of C. orbiculare on N. benthamiana when SIB1 or SIB2 were transiently expressed. N. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring the plasmid expressing SIB1, the plasmid expressing SIB2, or the empty plasmid (EV), and the infiltrated leaves were incubated for 2 days and then drop-inoculated with conidial suspensions (5 \u00d7 10 5 conidia/ml) of C. orbiculare 104-T. The photograph was taken at 5 dpi. Similar results were obtained from two additional experiments.

The SIB1-knockout vector, named pCB1636SIB1, was constructed and introduced into the lig4\u0394 strain, and knockout mutants of SIB1 were obtained (Figs. S3A and 3B). The colony morphology and conidiogenesis of the generated SIB1-knockout mutants (sib1\u0394) on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium were similar to those of the control parental strain (Fig. S3C ). We then inoculated the sib1\u0394 strains on N. benthamiana, cucumber, and melon and found that the sib1\u0394 strains developed the same lesions as the control strain for all plants tested (Fig. 3B ).",

As shown in Figure 4A (upper panel), the mass of the reduced SIB1 (5378.586 m/z) was slightly smaller than the theoretical value of 5396.388 m/z, which suggests that the SIB1 expressed by the BY-2 system had some modification. A search of the Unimod database suggested that the difference (\u221217.802 m/z) is derived from pyroglutamylation of the N-terminal residue, Gln1. To confirm the pyroglutamylation of SIB1, we used pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (PGAP) treatment of SIB1. Because only N-terminal pyroglutamic acid is cleaved by this treatment, we used this assay to determine whether the sample protein contained N-terminal pyroglutamic acid. For the PGAP-treated sample (Fig. 4A , lower panel), only the peak (5267.895 m/z), which corresponds to the N-terminal glutamine-cleaved SIB1 (\u0394Q1-SIB1), was detected. The MS results showed clearly that the N-terminal residue of SIB1 expressed in BY-2 cells was pyroglutamic acid. The Gln at the N-terminal end was easily modified to pyroglutamic acid (31, 32) .",

Importantly, we also identified two novel effectors of C. orbiculare, named SIB1 and SIB2, that suppressed N. benthamiana immunity against C. orbiculare. SIB1 was found to be conserved in the genome of 18 Colletotrichum species but was not found outside the Colletotrichum genus. Homologs encoding the amino acid sequence identical to that of C. orbiculare SIB1 were found in C. spinosum, C. trifolii, and C. sidae, which also belong to the orbiculare clade (37) . SIB2 homologs were identified in the genome of 24 Colletotrichum species, including C. spinosum and C. trifolii but not in C. sidae.",

Plant NADPH oxidases, also known as respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs), produce ROS (38) . An RBOHB (NbRBOHB) of N. benthamiana plays crucial roles in ROS production triggered by PAMPs, such as bacterial flagellin and fungal chitin, and facilitates plant immunity against biotrophic pathogens such as the oomycete pathogen P. infestans (39) (40) (41) . SIB1 also partially suppressed INF1-induced cell death in N. benthamiana. It has been reported that the silencing of Rboh genes leads to a reduction and delay in HR cell death caused by INF1 in N. benthamiana (41) . Therefore, SIB1mediated suppression of the ROS burst may be involved in the SIB1-mediated suppression of INF1-induced cell death. On the other hand, NbRbohB silencing decreases resistance to P. infestans but not to C. orbiculare (39) . Therefore, the increased susceptibility of N. benthamiana to C. orbiculare via transient expression of SIB1 is unlikely to depend on the SIB1mediated suppression of the ROS burst. SIB1 may be able to suppress other immune responses in addition to the ROS burst.",

This result suggests that SIB1 may contribute to the primary stage of host invasion. By contrast, in the case of C. orbiculare inoculation on cucumber, the expression of SIB1 was highest at 48 hpi, and its expression level remained high at 72 hpi. These findings suggest that C. orbiculare changes the expression pattern of effector genes, including SIB1, during infection of two unrelated susceptible plants, cucumber and N. benthamiana. In addition, the inoculation assays using the SIB1-knockout mutants revealed that SIB1 was not essential for the virulence of C. orbiculare on N. benthamiana, cucumber, and melon, although the transient expression of SIB1 in N. benthamiana increased the susceptibility to C. orbiculare. We now consider that other effectors of C. orbiculare may have functional redundancy with SIB1.",

            "text": "Interestingly, both the two peptides found as the structural neighbors of SIB1 display antifungal activity. For their biological activities, they share common structural features on their molecular surfaces. Each has a positively charged area composed of several Lys residues and a hydrophobic area formed by several Tyr residues (42, 43) . Both areas are expected to be necessary for their function; the cationic site binds to the anionic part of membrane phospholipids, and the hydrophobic site binds to the hydrophobic moiety of phospholipids. Although SIB1 also has a Lys-rich region on the surface as shown in Figure 5D , the SIB1 surface does not have a Tyr cluster because of no Tyr residue. Thus, distinct structural characteristics of SIB1 should be related to its functional mechanism to be uncovered. We observed pyroglutamylation of SIB1 at the N terminus in the present study. Similar N-terminal modification has been reported for many peptides and proteins. For example, brazzein, a sweet-tasting protein of African plants that adopts a well-known protein fold seen in defensins and arthropod toxins, has a pyroglutamylated N-terminal end (44) . This modification may be necessary for preventing protein degradation in host cells (45) . Therefore, it is possible that the N-terminal modification of SIB1 occurs in nature and functions to extend its lifetime in plant cells. For further understanding of the molecular function of the effector SIB1, especially in the suppression of immunity in N. benthamiana, further studies are needed for the comprehensive mutational analyses of SIB1 based on the unraveled SIB1 structure and identification of the N. benthamiana proteins targeted by SIB1.",

To generate the lig4-knockout strain, we introduced pBATTEFPGENLIG4KO into protoplasts of C. orbiculare 104-T.

Similar to the T 1 experiments, T 2 measurements were also performed as a series of ten experiments with different Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill delays of 25, 60, 80, 120, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 750 ms. The T 1 and T 2 values were estimated by fitting the peak volume, I, using the equation, I = I o exp(-t/T 1,2 ). As for the heteronuclear NOE experiments, a recycle delay of 5 s was used after each scan.",
