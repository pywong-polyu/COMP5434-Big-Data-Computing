Four SUQC model variables, which are related to their features, are used to specify the flux of people within four possible states, namely the Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected.

The limitation of detection methods and the medical resources can greatly delay the confirmation process, insomuch the confirmation proportion C I is less than 1 and time-varying. In this paper, we modify the model that appears in the work of Zhao and Chen [15] by adding the recovery class R which contains the individuals who have been infected and then recovered, as well as those who no longer spread the disease. This compartment class sees some augmentatin in terms of individuals recovering from their infection and a decrease as regards individuals who surrender to death due to loss of immunity. Let N be the size of the population i.e. N \u00bc S \u00fe U \u00fe Q \u00fe C \u00fe R , and we assume that N is constant, i.e., fixed over time. Another thing is that COVID-19 mortality rate seems higher compared to other diseases and that the number of deaths is on the rise across the globe. Hence, we assume a different mortality rates to the model compartments, namely l 1 , l 2 , l 3 , l 4 and l 5 .",

This fact leads us to include stochastic perturbation, which is analogous to that of Imhof and Walcher [7] in order to show how the noise affects our epidemic model and the transmission dynamics. At this point, we assume that stochastic perturbations are of a white noise type which are directly proportional to S(t), U(t), Q(t),C(t) influenced on the _ S\u00f0t\u00de, _ U\u00f0t\u00de, _ Q\u00f0t\u00de, _ C\u00f0t\u00de in the model (1). Finally, since R(t) does not appear in the equations of system (1), it is quite adequate to consider only the equations for S(t) , U(t), Q(t), and C(t). Hence, the system that we propose in this study while introducing white noises and taking into account the effects of media coverage on the transmission dynamics with the transformations S N \u00bc s; U N \u00bc u; Q N \u00bc q; and C N \u00bc c; can be written as",

It has posed a potential threat to human health attracting worldwide attention after the (SARS) 2003 and the (MERS) 2012 and up to this very moment, there is no entirely proper treatment of it. Instead, preventive measures should be strictly implemented such as social distancing and other infection control measures to prevent the spread of SARSCoV-2 via human-to-human transmission. The compartmental model (Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected) proposed in the present study of the spread of COVID-19 has taken into account the particularities of this infectious disease where some of them are still not wellknown. As well, we have used parameters and variables pertaining to the effects of quarantine and confirmation methods. In an attempt to render our model more realistic, we have included stochastic perturbations. Given that media awareness is one of the most useful tools that contributes to the control of epidemic spreading [11] , we have tried to investigate the effects of media coverage on the transmission dynamics. By having recourse to the stochastic theory and the compartmental mathematical model keeping in view the characteristics of the novel COVID-19, our study seeks to study the spread and the transmission dynamics. We initially adopted the idea of stochastic Lyapunov functions theory to prove the existence and positivity of the solution. Then, the extinction has been further discussed to pave the way for the conditions that put an end to the disease. Sufficient condition to the persistence of the disease is also obtained. More significantly, numerical simulations are presented to show these results as well as the impact of media coverage on the size of the infected class. Overall, it is worth noting that there is a great influence of noise intensity on the COVID-19 transmission. Equally important, media efforts could be helpful to reduce the number of infectives and offer more time to authorities to react to the global pandemic.",
