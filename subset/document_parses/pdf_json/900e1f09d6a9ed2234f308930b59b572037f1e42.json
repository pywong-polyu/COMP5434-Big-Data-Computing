Global health infrastructure has been challenged, in some cases failing. In the United States, the inability of laboratories to provide adequate testing for the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has been the subject of negative press and national debate. Even so, these challenges have prompted pathology practices and clinical labs to change their organizations and operations for the better. The natural positive evolution of the University of Oklahoma Department of Pathology and OU Health Laboratories has been greatly accelerated by the global pandemic. While developing a substantial COVID testing response, our department of pathology and laboratories have evolved a much nimbler organizational structure, established an important research partnership, built a translational research resource, created a significant reference lab capability, and completed many key hires against a national background of hiring freezes and pay cuts. Also, the high visibility of the clinical lab and pathologists during the outbreak has reinforced the value of lab medicine to patient care across our health system. In the midst of significant ongoing changes to the structure and financing of our underlying organizations, high trust among departmental, hospital, health system, and medical school leadership during the pandemic has promoted these positive changes, allowing us to emerge much stronger from this crisis.",

The health care system has been heavily stressed, in some instances breaking down through lack of physical capacity, shortage of providers, disruptions in supply chains, and delayed care of non-COVID maladies. Clinical laboratories have been in the news for failure to provide widespread and timely testing. The vaunted US laboratory infrastructure was at first overwhelmed, lacking necessary reagents, supplies, and appropriately trained personnel. In addition, the initial requirement for emergency use authorization of tests delayed laboratory responses to the crisis. Our early experience was that virtually all COVID-related testing supplies were difficult or impossible to obtain. Vendors often explained that the federal government was directing allocations, and in many cases, no information was available regarding future availability. Despite this ongoing disaster, the OU Health Laboratories and the University of Oklahoma Department of Pathology are headed toward the post-pandemic world with improved capabilities and resources. The natural positive evolution of the department and laboratory has been greatly accelerated by the global pandemic.",

            "text": "For many years, our teaching hospital system was subtotally owned and entirely managed by a for-profit hospital chain. The separate College of Medicine has been a not-for-profit unit of the University of Oklahoma, the state's flagship institution of higher education. An affiliated not-for-profit entity, OU Medicine, recently rebranded as OU Health, bought out the for-profit company on February 1, 2018. This realignment of the university and its academic health system set the stage for long-term, far-reaching improvements. Essentially, this shift away from shareholders as stakeholders brought local decision-making for any hospital margin. Because expenditures had been curtailed in anticipation of the transition, demand for capital, operating funds, and hires was pent up. Some of the earliest major decisions included building a patient tower (which began a staggered opening in the fall of 2020) that increased the square footage of the adult acute care hospital by approximately 80% and added operating room capacity, designing a multiyear move to the Epic electronic health record from Meditech, upgrading radiology's picture archiving and communication system, and expanding our children's intensive care unit. For pathology and laboratory, the changeover first led to a major equipment refresh that was designed and contracted for in 2019 for deployment in 2020. This push did not aid the ramp-up of COVID testing capacity but included an array of analyzers and automation in chemistry, immunoassay, hematology, HLA, and flow cytometry. Upgraded immunohistochemistry capacity and on-site in-situ hybridization were also budgeted for anatomic pathology. Although COVID has slowed down several of these platform implementations, other initiatives are fundamentally changing pathology services at OU.",

On March 6, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in Oklahoma was reported in Tulsa County. On March 11, the local National Basketball Association (NBA) game was postponed after a visiting team player tested positive for the novel coronavirus. This news galvanized the state. On March 21, 2020, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt issued an executive order directing the OU Medicine Laboratories, Oklahoma State University, and the Oklahoma State Department of Public Health to work together to provide COVID testing. 1 Although not specifying structure or numbers, the executive order did launch a series of regular meetings between these entities to share ideas and expertise and established our laboratory's role in supporting community testing. Critically, it also aided working with a major vendor of COVID testing kits and equipment. Thus began a highly visible struggle to overcome a myriad of supply chain, personnel, safety, and reporting issues to serve the citizens of Oklahoma. These pressures, superimposed on ongoing organizational transformation, led to a series of positive changes in our department and clinical laboratories.",

On the hospital side, just before the pandemic, laboratory personnel reported through 2 levels of nursing leadership ( Figure 1 ). Laboratory staffing, equipment, and reagent decisions were under final control of the hospital. Although this reporting structure sufficed for normal operations, discussions had been underway for several months to create a more formal service line led by an associate vice president for laboratory services partnered with the pathology faculty chief of service.

Nursing services were consumed by our system ramp-up for COVID, and our leadership could not adequately represent our urgent needs at the highest level of the organization. Oversight of the lab was therefore transferred to a dyad, the chief of the laboratory service and the president of Oklahoma Children's Hospital, supported by the vice chief of service and the children's hospital chief operating officer ( Figure 2 ). The chief of laboratory service and the system CEO made this selection, reasoning that the lab needed a strong central voice in administration and that a pediatric hospital would be less likely to be affected by a disease that was particularly devastating for elderly patients. The pairs immediately clicked, yielding an explosion of purchasing, hiring, and problem-solving. Frequent calls from the system CEO, aided by a deep level of trust, expedited moving resource allocation to the level of the dyad. Decision-making was collaborative and immediate: if the top dyad agreed, it simply got done. Some $2 million in testing equipment was purchased, space was repurposed and remodeled, and 15 full-time equivalents (FTEs) were hired, more than doubling the size of our virology staff. Testing in support of the health system and community was top priority, and no resources were held back. Having the only NCI-designated cancer center, level 1 trauma center, and freestanding children's hospital in the state, we were determined to serve our patients as a surge in COVID cases loomed.",

Although equipment and personnel spending has slowed down now and is subject to more routine justification and review processes, the successful new reporting model continues, a huge win for the laboratory. An associate vice president for laboratory services position has been posted, and discussions are in progress about pathology and laboratory forming the first true service line in the health system, as has been accomplished at other centers. 2, 3 In addition, our productive working relationship and recognition of the effort of the pathology faculty members have also fueled discussions toward an improved hospital contract for the pathology department.",

In late March, OMRF's director of translational informatics and clinical research resources (J.M.G.) reached out to propose using the Fluidigm Biomark HD microfluidics platform from his lab to detect SARS-CoV-2. This option offered the possibility of greatly increased testing capacity using reagents that were in less demand. OU Health Sciences Center core laboratory scientists also offered to help develop a COVID assay. To this point, given the history of being managed by a for-profit hospital chain, the OU Health Laboratories typically deployed Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved assays, although several of the faculty medical directors had substantial experience with laboratorydeveloped tests (LDTs), either from training or in the department's separate molecular pathology laboratory. With the encouragement of the OUHSC vice president for research, OU Health, OMRF, and OUHSC almost immediately decided to develop a high-throughput robotic-assisted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test using the Biomark HD. After completing space improvements in record time, the needed equipment was moved to an unused area of the OU Health Labs that had been awaiting renovation. Research scientists and technicians initiated the test design and validation process but were gradually replaced by lab technologists, clinical faculty, and a key pathology resident (R.L.) who had previously worked with this research platform. Finally, the director of the infectious diseases lab (C.B.M.) oversaw the completion and deployment of the LDT, the Oklahoma COVID-19 PCR. We submitted for emergency use authorization on April 20, 2020, and again with a revised version of the assay on June 26, 2020. However, as we awaited review, FDA determined that such authorization was not required, so we declined further consideration. This effort has created a much stronger tie between OMRF and the department of pathology, with additional collaborations expected.",

The further development of this capacity to support bench-to-bedside work has been formalized as part of a memorandum of understanding finalizing the department of pathology's graduate program 7-year review.

Reference testing was discouraged when we were managed by a for-profit, and our HIS/LIS was poor at supporting such. Early in the COVID testing build-out, we recognized that the OU Health Labs would perform large volumes of both medical system and community testing. Testing clients eventually included the state and local health departments, OU student health, a local private school, and a limited number of local businesses. To handle the increased numbers of specimens, a reference lab-like frontend was built to process community swab pod specimens and staffed separately from our core lab's central receiving and processing area. This created 2 flows of specimens, our preexisting Meditech-based one and a physically separate path using an in-house developed laboratory information management system. The separate high-volume accessioning area was developed in repurposed space to handle high-throughput community testing, which ramped up to over 1000 COVID PCR tests per weekday. We also deployed a commercial software solution for reference work, CareEvolve, allowing for point of collection preaccessioning (OU Health nursing and operations personnel) and flexible reporting, including a patient portal. Besides these features, this system was chosen for its rapid implementation and scalability. As the pandemic subsides, we will use this software package, and, in 2022, the Epic electronic health record, to bolster reference lab testing for the region. To start, we plan to offer new tests in infectious diseases and specialized coagulation, areas of significant existing expertise, further expanding our menu and hopefully supporting additional faculty members.",

Several informative \"lab alerts\" were distributed to the medical staff, educating them on test characteristics, ordering, and turnaround time expectations. We also set up a multidisciplinary test utilization group composed of our lead infectious disease physician, an inpatient CMO (a pediatric surgeon), an outpatient CMO (a family practitioner), and 3 pathologists to address all types of COVID testing. This workgroup met as needed, designing clinical protocols when tests were initially scarce and eventually prioritizing testing by clinical scenario, as turnaround times ranged from about 1.5 hours for rapid platforms to almost 24 hours for batched assays. In addition, this group regularly reported to our overall incident command for COVID, on which the 3 nonpathologists and the chief pathologist served. Operationally, pathologists also had significant roles in the state testing effort and ongoing infection control. We were also very active in the media, with several interviews with multiple television stations, formal social media events, and newspaper appearances. Internal and external activities such as these have been suggested as ways for academic pathologists to add value. 4 Our efforts to support OU Health continue, as we deploy new SARS-CoV-2 platforms to flexibly support a broad range of testing needs and help guide our colleagues in test selection as influenza and other respiratory disease season progresses.",

With this change, the current administrative partners more clearly see the capabilities and needs of pathology and the laboratory. Decision-making is much faster, and our reach through the organization is enhanced. Furthermore, the combination of our transition to a true freestanding academic medical center and the threat of COVID-19 has created productive relationships with city, county, and state public health departments, OMRF, the College of Public Health, and main campus research labs. Finally, we have gained translational research capabilities and developed significant reference lab possibilities. Through this chaotic time in which we often acted on instinct, years of organizational evolution occurred in less than one. Moving past the pandemic, clinical laboratories can use the lessons learned and relationships forged from difficult circumstances to continue to advance the science and practice of laboratory medicine.",
