Most of the spreading models assume that users interact uniformly in time following a Poisson process, but recent measurements have shown that the intercontact time follows heavy-tailed distribution. The non-Poisson nature of contact dynamics results in prevalence decay times significantly larger than predicted by standard Poisson process based models. Email viruses spread over a logical network defined by email address books. The topology of this network plays important role in the spreading dynamics. Recent observations suggest that node degrees in email networks are heavytailed distributed and can be modeled as power law network. We propose an email virus propagation model that considers both heavy-tailed intercontact time distribution, and heavy-tailed topology of email networks.",

            "text": "In order to eradicate viruses, as well as to control and limit the impact of an outbreak, we need to have a detailed and quantitative understanding of the spreading dynamics and environment. In most email virus models have been assumed that the contact process between individuals follows Poisson statistics, and, the time between two consecutive contacts is predicted to follow an exponential distribution [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, reports of new infections should decay exponentially with a decay time of about a day, or at most a few days [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In contrast, prevalence records indicate that new infections are still reported years after the release of antiviruses [4, 7, 14] , and their decay time is in the vicinity of years, 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than the Poisson process predicted decay times. This discrepancy is rooted in the failure of the Poisson approximation for the interevent time distribution. Indeed, recent studies of email exchange records between have shown that the probability density function of the time interval between two consecutive emails sent by the same user is well approximated by a fat tailed distribution [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In [20] the authors prove that this deviation from the Poisson process has a strong impact on the email virus's spread, offering a coherent explanation of the anomalously long prevalence times observed for email viruses.",

This set of email messages was made public during the legal investigation concerning the Enron Corporation. It is the only publicly available email dataset and consists of 158 users (mostly senior management) and 200,399 messages (from which 9728 are between employees). The dataset contains messages from a period of almost three years. On Fig. 2 the degree distribution of the users' address books from this dataset is shown. We see that the power law P(k) ~ k -3.5 approximates well a substantial part of the users' degree distribution, but fails to approximate well for small degree values. This is mostly due to the fact that the number of users in the dataset is small, but nevertheless it gives us an insight into the real email network topology. Because of this degree distribution, and the findings from [21] , it is best if we model the email network as a power law network. The contact dynamics responsible for the spread of email viruses is driven by the email communication and the usage patterns of individuals. To characterize these patterns we also use the Enron email dataset. We use only the messages between the employees (9728 messages), and it is sufficient for accurate analysis. Let \u03c4 (interevent time) denote the time between two consecutive emails sent by a single user. The distribution of the aggregate interevent of all the users approximately follows a power law with exponent \u03b1 \u2248 2.4 and a cut-off at large \u03c4 values (Fig. 3) . ",
