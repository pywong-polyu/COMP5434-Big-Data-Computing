This will remain true even if the intellectual property rights of COVID-19 vaccines are waived temporarily. To accelerate technology transfer and global vaccine production, this article calls for the promotion of joint ventures between global COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers and local pharmaceutical companies so as to create regional manufacturing hubs. These joint ventures must be supported financially by global North countries, international organisations, and hostcountry governments. This approach will incentivize pharmaceutical companies to share not only their patents but also tacit production knowledge because the risk and cost of setting up new facilities will be shared. In this paper, we show how the joint venture approach will have benefits for all the actors involve and generate positive impact on Sub-Saharan Africa and other regions over the long run. Following these policy proposals will not only help protect the global community from COVID-19 but will also present a rare window of opportunity to stimulate the life science industry in the global South, supporting sustainable economic and technological development.",

            "text": "It is widely recognized that the global roll-out of vaccines is crucial to defeating the COVID-19 pandemic (Middleton et al., 2021) . This includes rapidly closing the gap in the vaccination uptake between the ''global North'' and ''global South'' to minimise the likelihood of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants causing current vaccines to be less effective in the future. In the UK and US, 71 and 61%, respectively, of people had received at least one dose of the vaccine by August 2021, while only 1.3% of total doses have so far gone to LICs (Our World in Data, 2021) . Boosting vaccine production capacity globally has become a critical priority for the global community. In Africa, there are fewer than ten African manufacturers with vaccine production and there is very limited upstream production capacity with most local companies only engaging in packaging and labelling (WHO, 2021) . Although the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (Gavi), and the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX, which is co-led by CEPI, Gavi and WHO) have provided seed funding and led matchmaking efforts to convince manufacturers to start scaling-up global production, a lack of capital investment, patented and tacit knowledge of vaccine production, a shortage of inputs, and the ongoing threat of 'vaccine nationalism' are impeding the much-needed expansion of global vaccine production (Athreye, 2021a; Bown, 2021; Meyer, 2021; Shadlen, 2020) .",

When pharmaceutical companies failed to cut the extortionate prices of vital drugs for HIV/AIDs two decades ago, the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) waiver was mostly used as a negotiation tool to decrease drug prices. However, with COVID-19 vaccines, supply is a bigger issue than affordability (Dyer, 2021) . Vaccine manufacturing is a particularly complex process that, in the case of COVID-19, has demanded an advanced level of technical know-how and manufacturing infrastructure to innovate the COVID-19 vaccine. For instance, Pfizer states that the production of mRNA vaccines requires highly specialised raw materials: 280 components produced by suppliers in 19 countries. It also suggests that production infrastructure using mRNA technology had to be built from scratch because such facilities did not exist anywhere in the world. Nevertheless, scientists at Moderna have estimated that future mRNA facilities can be built in 3-4 months (Cheng & Hinnant, 2021) , without including the time required for site regulatory approval.",

Even if the WTO adopts the patent waiver, pharmaceutical companies cannot be forced to share the know-how required to manufacture these vaccines. This is critical because tacit knowledge plays a central role in complex manufacturing, especially for new technologies such as the mRNA. Additionally, since mRNA has not previously been used in vaccine production, workers with the skills to implement this technology are difficult to find. Even those from the traditional biopharmaceutical industry will need to undergo rigorous training to produce mRNA vaccines. Lack of knowledge, both tacit and codified, and production capacity may be the most significant constraints undermining the production expansion of vaccines that the world urgently needs.",

However, it is only effective in situations where there are strong innovation and production capabilities, and where public procurement can provide strong market demand to support the growth of the new product producers. This is not the case for COVID-19 vaccine where there is a clear market demand and government interest in purchasing vaccines. Bown (2021) argues in favour of setting up a new and enforceable COVID-19 Vaccine Investment and Trade Agreement (CVITA). Such a CVITA can draw some lessons from the US subsidization and coordination of its domestic vaccine manufacturing supply chain under Operation Warp Speed (OWS), which succeeded in the US in coordinating clinical trials and scaling up manufacturing in advance of regulatory approval of potential vaccines. This approach was felt to be essential to making rapid progress to the vaccine production in the US, but was constrained by shortages in the supply chain and 'vaccine nationalism' that is prevalent in the US, Europe, India and Japan. Hence, a CVITA is proposed to create the incentives to ensure the timely and sizable scaling up of output and input investments to response to this pandemic and future pandemic threats. The investment component of the agreement is also designed to create a framework to subsidize the full vaccine manufacturing supply chain and especially to coordinate expansion of input production capacity. The agreement is also required to include an enforceable commitment on the part of participating countries not to place export restrictions on supplies of vaccines and related materials for other countries participating in the agreement.",

It may be suitable for some developed countries with strong medical innovation and pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities, but the key question has now moved from those occurring in the early stage of vaccine development and production to global scale up. Additionally, developing countries are only marginally considered in this arrangement, although there is a sentence mentioning that participation of the poorest countries should be heavily subsidised. The poorest countries will very rarely have the technological capacity to join the current richcountry club. Moreover, the loose 'partnership' will not offer a strong push to help the developing countries to develop the production and gradually to acquire the technological capabilities in vaccine production that are needed in the long run.",

It is argued that public funding to national universities and laboratories based on decades of research and scholarship is the unsung hero of the COVID-19 vaccine effort (Athreye, 2021a) . This gives the justification and bargaining power to governments to force big pharmaceutical companies to follow this arrangement and to share their know-how. Admittedly, compulsory licensing of patents is a good short-run solution. It obliges the firm to share know-how in return for the license payment. However, current rules governing compulsory IP licensing are very restrictive. They only favour countries that already have productive capacity. Moreover, most of the tacit technological and managerial knowhow in supply chain management cannot be codified and transferred through compulsory licensing. Finally, successful technology transfer and local production capacity building based on compulsory licensing requires strong technological capabilities in the host country to understand the licensed technologies and to be able to convert them into locally useful production technology to build up production capacity. All of these difficulties pose significant challenges for most developing countries, especially in Africa and in low-income countries.",

In compulsory licensing, reducing prices is an objective in itself, whereas in joint ventures technology transfer takes centre stage. Where there is successful learning and where the IP is counted as part of the investment into the IJV, there will be a cheapening of the product in the long term. The reasons why joint ventures are preferred to compulsory licensing are that: (1) the IJV also brings in capital investment by the big pharmaceutical companies; (2) the IJV brings in technological and managerial knowhow that is much needed in the production of vaccine; (3) the IJV will be included in the MNE's network and will thus gain access to knowledge of the supply chain and its management; (4) a compulsory licence needs to be valid over the operating lifetime of the plant instead of ''until the end of the pandemic'', which may not be acceptable for IP owners; and (5) the enforcement of compulsion is rarely used -the requirements are too complex, especially for countries without local manufacturing capacity (Meyer, 2021) .",

Among them, FDI as a bundle of financial capital and technological and managerial knowledge is an effective vehicle that facilitates international knowledge diffusion and promotes industrialisation in developing host countries (Buckley et al., 2006; Dunning, 1994; Fu & Hou, 2021; Fu et al., 2021a; Ghauri, Fu, & V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen, 2017; Lall, 1996) . The developing countries, especially the Newly Industrialised Economies and the Asian Tigers in East and South East Asia, and in the emerging economies such as China, have benefited from foreign technology transfer Hou & Mohnen, 2013; Hu, Jefferson, & Qian, 2005; Javorcik, 2004; Lall, 1996 Lall, , 2001 Liu & Buck, 2007; Pietrobelli & Rabellotti, 2007) . MNEs' headquarters have internal incentives to encourage cross-board knowledge flows and to share technology subsidiaries from different locations (Brandt & Rawski, 2019; Buckley and Ghauri, 2004; Buckley et al., 2006; Eapen, 2012; Markusen, 2002 ). Yet, crossborder technology transfers and diffusion are neither cost-free nor unconditional. They rely on well-directed technological efforts (Lall & Pietrobelli, 2005 ) and on absorptive capacity in the host (Cohen & Levinthal, 1989; Fu, 2008; Meyer, 2004) .",

Moreover, there has not been a universal Southern experience. Although some industries in China have been successful at technology transfer from joint ventures, Chinese firms in the high-technology sector have not been able to develop indigenous technological capabilities through FDI (Fu, 2015; Nolan, 2002) . In the case of Africa, inter-firm technology transfer is limited due to limited linkages, weak local absorptive capacity, and cultural differences. In the case of Chinese MNEs, the language barrier is also an important inhibitor (Fu, Essegbey, & Frempong, 2017) . However, within MNE subsidiaries or joint ventures, technology transfers from foreign technologically more advanced partners succeed if the local partners have basic capabilities in the industry (Carrillo, 1996; Oguji et al., 2021) . Effective communication, the development of business and social networks through informal and personal relationships, training, and teamwork helped to facilitate knowledge transfers at the individual level within joint ventures and subsidiaries (Carrillo, 1996; Fu et al., 2017; Kivrak et al., 2014) . This also took place in joint ventures between Chinese and African partners (Ado et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017) .",

The aim should be to encourage MNEs to share not only their patents but also their tacit production knowledge with manufacturers across the world. In order to do that, we believe that joint ventures between leading pharmaceutical companies and local pharmaceutical companies based in the global South should be promoted. These joint ventures will form regional manufacturing hubs and can be financed by governments in the global North, the host countries, international organisations and pharmaceutical companies. The financial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated that investment in these novel vaccines is economically viable for all aforementioned actors.

However, partners also compete to appropriate knowledge and value for their private benefits (Hamel, Doz, & Prahalad, 1989) . Recent papers on international joint ventures (e.g. Sun, Deng, & Wright, 2021) suggest international joint ventures in emerging markets that involve making deals with political institutions in order to get the venture going, may also create risks of opportunism once the technology has been transferred. There is political pressure for the MNE partnering with state-owned firms to innovate. State partners are powerful in boosting IJV innovation investment but this can limit the shaping of IJV innovation outcomes. However, based on findings from their research, Sun et al. (2021) caution against an overly protective approach to managing transactional hazards. They argue that ''it may be reasonable to increase hazardous investments, which act as a price of admission to a host market and a steppingstone to leverage a continuous flow of essential resources from host-country political institutions''. They also ''prompt managers to develop a more sophisticated evaluation of the prowess of their political partners. In the case of knowledgebased cooperative activities, some powerful partners may not be as dangerous as the case in physicalcapital-intensive ventures''.",

The experience of successful technology transfer in lowcarbon energy technologies also suggests that IJV are effective channels for international technology transfer related to public goods to the developing and emerging countries (e.g. Fu & Zhang, 2011; Kirchherr & Urban, 2018; Lema, Fu, & Rabellotti, 2020) , given the presence of suitable government policies and adequate capacities in the recipient country. Kirchherr and Urban (2018) find that a common key success factor is joint ventures in their Meta analysis. These IJVs set up excellent examples for the international technology transfer through South-South and North-South technology transfer and cooperation for other public goods for the global community, like global health.",
