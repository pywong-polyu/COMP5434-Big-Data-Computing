            "text": "Patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) sometimes develop refractory respiratory failure and may require venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). It is known that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sometimes present in the blood of COVID-19 patients. VV-ECMO is often used for several weeks, and plasma leaks can occur, albeit rarely. Hence, in terms of infection control, a concern is that SARS-CoV-2 may leak from the gas outlet port of the oxygenator during ECMO support of critically ill COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 leaks from the oxygenator during ECMO support. Five patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia were placed on VV-ECMO. Silicone-coated polypropylene membrane oxygenators were used in the ECMO circuits for these patients. SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in serum and at the gas outlet port of the ECMO circuit at the time of circuit replacement or liberation from ECMO. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the gas outlet port of the ECMO circuit for three of the five patients. None of the medical staff involved in the care of these five patients has been infected with COVID-19. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 could leak to the gas outlet port of the ECMO circuit through silicone-coated polypropylene membranes during ECMO support of critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

Furthermore, some patients with severe respiratory failure may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in addition to mechanical ventilation for respiratory support. 1 However, in terms of infection control, a concern is that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may leak through the membrane from the blood during ECMO support of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. 2 In fact, a previous study has reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal cavity, pharynx, feces, sputum, and blood of patients with COVID-19. 3 Another study also reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the blood of 15% of patients with COVID-19. 4 Although polymethylpentene (asymmetric) or silicone-coated polypropylene (composite) membrane oxygenators are designed to prevent plasma leakage during ECMO support, it can occur, albeit rarely, after several weeks of ECMO support. 5 Therefore, the virus might leak through the membrane from serum to the gas outlet port.",

The circuit used was the MERA Exeline HP2/PCPS, which consists of a 3/8-inch-diameter heparin-coated polyvinyl chloride tube (Senko Medical Instrument Mfg. Co., Ltd.), an oxygenator (HPO-23WH-C; Senko Medical Instrument Mfg. Co., Ltd.), and a centrifugal pump (HCF-MP23H; Senko Medical Instrument Mfg. Co., Ltd.). The oxygenator in this circuit consists of siliconecoated polypropylene membranes (membrane area = 2.3 m 2 , oxygenator volume = 225 ml, oxygenator pressure tolerance = 500 mm Hg, and the manufacturer's recommended 6 hours of use). The drainage cannula was either the MERA NSH Heparinization Percutaneous Cardiopulmonary Support Cannula (PCKC-V-24/24Fr; Senko Medical Instrument Mfg. Co., Ltd.) or the QuickDraw (QD25/25Fr; Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The return cannula was the MERA NSH Heparinization Percutaneous Cardiopulmonary Support cannula (PCKC-A-20/20Fr; Senko Medical Instrument Mfg. Co., Ltd.), which was inserted through the internal jugular or femoral vein. The gas-exchange capacity of the oxygenator may decrease because of condensation in the oxygenator. To prevent this, we have devised the following modification. First, warm air is blown into the oxygenator using a warming device (3M Bair Hugger Normothermia System; 3M Japan, Tokyo, Japan) to prevent condensation in oxygenator. 6, 7 Second, the oxygenator is covered with a polyethylene sheet like a tent ( Figure 1 ) to prevent cool outside air from causing condensation. For anticoagulation, intravenous heparin was administered to achieve a target activated clotting time of 180-200 s. We visually checked whether there was plasma leakage from the oxygenator at least three times a day. We replaced the circuit by the following criteria: 1) clots were detected within the circuit or oxygenator, 2) plasma leakage was detected, and/or 3) a decrease in the gas-exchange capacity of the oxygenator was detected and could not be easily solved.",

Although no viral RNA was detected in serum measured at circuit replacement or liberation from ECMO (Table 2 ), our results suggest that viral RNA may have accumulated in the gas outlet port of the oxygenator, even though the viremia improved between the start of treatment and the time of measurement. It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected on the plastic surface for as long as 7 days. 11 We initially expected that high pressure in the oxygenator was associated with leakage of viral RNA. An additional factor could be deterioration of the coating because of long-term use, and long-term ECMO support is considered a risk factor for leakage. However, this study could not demonstrate that leakage of viral RNA leakage was associated with high pressure in the oxygenator or long-term use, and pressure measurement data were also limited. We think there are other factors that affect leakage, but they are difficult to elucidate with the limited number of cases and amount of clinical data in this study. We believe that further research is needed in the future.",

            "text": "The second difference is the timing of measuring SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Given that ECMO support can last for several weeks, we considered a long observation period to be necessary for determining whether the virus leaked through the membrane. Indeed, previous studies have reported that the average running time of ECMO was 218 hours 13 and that critically ill patients with COVID-19 required up to 47 days of ECMO support. 14 Given that viremia can persist for a long time in patients with severe COVID-19, 15 there is a possibility that the virus could leak after more than 48 hours following the initiation of ECMO. In addition, medical staff will handle the oxygenator at the time of circuit replacement or liberation from ECMO. Therefore, we decided to measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the gas outlet port of the oxygenator at the time of ECMO circuit replacement, liberation, or withdrawal. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in the serum of all patients at the time of circuit replacement or liberation from ECMO, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected at the gas outlet port of the oxygenator in 3 of the 5 patients. We also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum of patients 1 and 2 while they were on ECMO support ( Table 2 ). In the study by Dres et al., 12 samples at the gas outlet port of the oxygenator were obtained only within 48 hours after initiation of ECMO. This may account for their opposite results regarding leakage of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the membrane.",

First, the infectivity of the virus detected at the gas outlet port is not known, and it is also unclear whether protective measures are needed for gas outlet port. The sweep gas flow rate of ECMO is often temporarily increased to blow off dew condensation when the oxygenator is in the wet lung state. However, this maneuver might be dangerous for the medical staff because of potential dissemination of the virus. Therefore, covering the oxygenator with a polyethylene sheet may be useful for preventing viral spread in addition to preventing condensation in the oxygenator. Because of the appropriate use of personal protective equipment and covering the oxygenator, none of the medical staff involved in the care of these five patients, including doctors, nurses, clinical engineers, and rehabilitation staff, was found to be infected with COVID-19 by the end of July 2020.",

Second, we could not check all the oxygenators we handled because of limitations on the RT-PCR measurements. In addition, the gas outlet port of the oxygenator could be measured only at the time of circuit replacement or liberation from ECMO, because swabs could damage the membrane of the oxygenator. In principle, it would be desirable to take measurements at multiple times to find out when viral RNA is detected at the gas outlet port of the oxygenator. Third, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the swab of the ECMO gas outlet port was very small; although the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed, the infectivity is not known. Fourth, there is no direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 leaked through the membrane. It may be necessary to confirm membrane damage by the electron microscopy. Finally, further study is warranted to examine whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected at gas outlet port of polymethylpentene membrane oxygenators at the time of circuit replacement or liberation from ECMO.",
