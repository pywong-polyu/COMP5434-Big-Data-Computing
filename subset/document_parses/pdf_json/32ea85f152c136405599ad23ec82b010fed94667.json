The present study aimed to analyze first the genomic variation of the twenty-eight Moroccan strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from March 03, 2020 to May 15, 2020, to compare their distributions with twelve other viral genomes from North Africa as well as to identify their possible sources. Our finding revealed 61 mutations in the Moroccan genomes of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1/2019, of them 23 (37.7%) were present in two or more genomes. Focusing on non-synonymous mutations, 29 (47.54%) were distributed in five genes (ORF1ab, spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and ORF3a) with variable frequencies. The non-structural protein coding regions nsp3-Multi domain and nsp12-RdRp of the ORF1ab gene harbored more mutations, with six for each. The comparison of genetic variants of fourty North African strains revealed that two non-synonymous mutations D614G (in spike) and Q57H (in ORF3a) were common in four countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt), with a prevalence of 92.5% (n = 37) and 42.5% (n = 17), respectively, of the total genomes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Moroccan and Tunisian SARS-CoV-2 strains were closely related to those from different origins (Asia, Europe, North and South America) and distributed in different distinct subclades. This could indicate different sources of infection with no specific strain dominating yet in in these countries. These results have the potential to lead to new comprehensive investigations combining genomic data, epidemiological information and the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2.",

Among them, D614G (in S protein) and Q57H (in OR3a) were observed in strains from the four countries. The D614G mutation is proximal to the S1 cleavage domain of advanced glycoprotein (26) and was of great interest due to their predominance in the six continents (27, 28) . Alouane et al. (13) showed that this mutation appeared for the first time on January 24, 2020 in the Asian region (China), after a week it was also observed in Europe (Germany). The Q57H mutation was taken away end of February in Africa (Senegal), Europe (France and Belgium) and North America (USA and Canada). Likewise, our previous study (13) showed that D614G had no impact on the two-dimensional or three-dimensional structure of advanced glycoprotein. Of the other three non-synonymous mutations that are variable between the strains from the four countries, T265I mutation (in nsp2) was The ORF1ab polyprotein is known to be cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16) (6) . We observed two domains rich in non-synonymous mutations, the first, nsp3-Multi domain due to its large size compared to other non-structural proteins and previously described as playing a different role in SARS-CoV-2 infection (29) .",

In the present study, we investigated the genomic diversity of twenty-eight SARS-CoV-2 strains that emerged in Morocco between March 3 th and May 15 th , 2020 with s six new genomes presented for the first time. Next, we compared the distribution of these SARS-CoV-2 variants with twelve other genomes from North Africa (Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt). In addition, the identification of the possible source of the Moroccan strains was carried out by comparing them with genomes from Africa, Asia, Europe, North and",

The distribution of these mutations along the viral genome revealed that five genes (ORF1ab, S, M, N and ORF3a) harbored mutations with varying frequencies. It is interesting to note that 37.7% (n = 23) of mutations were present in two or more genomes, while the remainder were singleton mutations. Focusing on non-synonymous mutations, 75.86% (n = 22) were located in the ORF1ab gene and distributed in eight non-structural proteins, including 6 (D1036E, L1249H, V2047F, P2110L, A2637V and T2648I) in nsp3-Multi-domain, 6 (C4588F, S4611L, C4772F, T5020I, A5039S and R5314M) in nsp12-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), three (P6000S, T6249P and M6345V) in nsp14-Exonuclease, 2 (T7083I and Ter6967Y) in nsp16 Methyltransferase and one for each of the five other nsp; nsp2 (T265I), nsp5-main proteinase (V3388I), nsp10-CysHis (R4387S), nsp13-Helicase (T5448I) and nsp15-EndoRNAse (Ter6668W).

Whereas, the two remaining mutations S202N (in N protein) as well as L84S (in ORF8) were recurrent in genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from Tunisia.Phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Moroccan genomes with other genomes analysis wa carried out using a set of 256 genomes from different countries representing the 6 continents (Table S2) in order to study the possible source of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in North Africa, with a focus on Moroccan strains. The phylogenetic tree revealed five main clades: two clades (represented by mauve and green colors) particularly contained strains from Asia, while the other clades contained strains belonging to different continents. We observed that approximately 70% of the strains belonged to the clade colored in light orange and showing the mutation D614G (in S protein). With the exception of three strains from Tunisia, all of the North African strains harboring the D614G mutation belonged to this clade, which is also subdivided into several subclades. Among the twenty-eight Moroccan strains, five (Morocco/6893, Morocco/6906, Morocco/15N, Morocco/6902 and Morocco/6888) were close to the strains from South America (Chile or Brazil). Likewise, four strains (Morocco/RMPS-01, Morocco/RMPS-04, Morocco/RMPS-06 and Morocco/9601) seem to share a close sequence similarity with the strains from Israel (Asia), USA (North America) and the isolates from Algeria (Africa), while Morocco/RMPS-02 and Morocco/6891 were close to those from the USA (North America) and Tunisia (Africa). In addition, three strains (Morocco/6899 Morocco/6900 and Morocco/6905) were grouped with strains from Gambia (West Africa ), and Italy (Europe ) for Morocco/6906.

It is interesting to note that the Moroccan and Tunisian strains were closely related to those from Asia, Europe, South and North America, which could indicate different sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection in these two countries. Whereas, the sources of strains from Algeria and Egypt could probably be from two main countries namely Israel (Asia) and USA (North America).
