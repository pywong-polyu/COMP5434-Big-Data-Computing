In general, energy demand has decreased, but the users who used the most energy during the pandemic were the people in their homes creating a change compared to the past. How have household habits changed affecting energy uses during the lockdown? Has energy demand changed equally in all homes? What factors help explain the change in daily household habits and the change in energy uses? Via distribution of a questionnaire completed by 3519 people living in Italy during the first lockdown #StayAtHome, the change in daily habits and consequent energy uses were investigated. It collected data on socio-demographic and household characteristics and the material context in which people live. The results were interpreted according to the social practice approach that has been used in the past to analyse energy habits and uses of households, for example, for cooking. The results can support the interpretation of energy demand studies in the pandemic period and address decisions and policymaking for sustainable energy transition.",

This happens, for example, when a new energy-efficient technology is proposed, the diffusion and use of which depends very much on people's reaction. Because of its complexity, the energy transition can be modified by other phenomena and processes, as was the case with the pandemic. The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 that began in 2019 in China has complicated energy transition [5] . The pandemic has decreased the energy demanded by the transport sector and increased the energy demanded by the residential sector [5, 6] , by consequences of the restrictions imposed by governments. In several countries, such as Spain, the UK, and Italy, severe restrictions were in place in the period March through May 2020. The restrictions impacted on electricity consumption [7], on global demand for oil and natural gas [5, 8] and strongly changing energy demand profiles, since people spent more time at home [7]. In general, the energy demand was abruptly decreased [5] , promoting what was initially thought to be a positive contribution to the energy transition, albeit in different ways among countries. The energy system that had been created and structured on the needs of production activities and transport, suddenly had to respond to a demand for energy mainly residential. The residential sector itself was not particularly efficient in meeting the increased demand for energy, for example having low-efficient heating systems impacting more on energy consumption when people stay at home for longer periods. This has added some complexities were added to the energy transition. The complexity added by the pandemic and related restrictions is being studied by many disciplines.",

The restrictions imposed by governments have had impacts promoting a mass change of health-related behaviours [10], but the changes are different for vulnerable groups and considering different places and times [10, 11] . For example, the poverty that is more present in some cities reduces the likelihood to stay-at-home [10]. Since their effects on the stay-at-home behaviour, the vulnerability and the poverty are consequently impacting on the COVID-19 diffusion [10] . The diffusion of the COVID-19 is also affected by the sociodemographics [12, 13] .

[5] underline such relevant topics as the policies aimed at avoiding energy poverty during COVID-19 restrictions [19] . It is important to promote ad hoc policies to reduce energy poverty so that it can be possible to continue to pursue low-emissions transition goals. At the same time, given the period of drastic change, it is also important and reinforcing high quality research practices that support the validity of findings [20] and support for developing solutions for a sustainable and just transition [21, 22] . As people's changing behaviours have been explored and studied to understand the spread of COVID-19 [10, 12, 13] , it would be necessary to analyse people's energy habits in the home to understand some relevant facets of the energy transition. Since the majority of energy demand has shifted to homes, it is critical to understand how people use that energy in order to promote sustainable change and effective policies for the energy transition. However, to our best knowledge, what is quite missing by now are studies in energy habits at home and their changes during the pandemic. This perspective can contribute to the idea of analysing and supporting the energy transition as a complex socio-technical process [23] .",

Energy consumption and use arises \"from complex and necessarily social configurations of human action\" [24, 25] , linking norms, attitudes, and social roles, household dynamics and relationships [26] . Several research fields have investigated energy-related behaviours in the past such as cooking, cleaning, showering, and working. These fields contribute in understanding how to promote a change towards effective and efficient energy use for all people [27] , reducing consumption and, at a later stage, CO2 emissions [28] . However, the observation and study of change processes is very complicated. Indeed, the change in habits and practices is a slow process in 'normal' life [27] . The COVID-19-related lockdown became an opportunity to observe and investigate rapid changes in daily habits and domestic energy uses [5, 25] .",

This approach provides a framework with three elements supporting the analysis of existing, disappearing, or reproducing daily habits: materiality, competences, and meanings [30] . For a social practice to exist or change, all three elements must co-exist or change together. Thus, to change a habit in the home, the person must believe that the new habit will bring greater benefits (meaning), must have access to new materialities such as new technologies, and must be able to act in an effective and beneficial way (competences). Meanings, skills and materialities are in turn affected by the context in which the person lives. The context includes cultural, social and economic differences, sociodemographic characteristics and physical and environmental characteristics.",

For example, woman has different tastes, and this can affect the choice of what to cook [33] and the time dedicated in cooking. But the meanings attached to a habit are also depending on the cultural and geographical context. For example, the organizing lunches with the large family is more relevant in Southern Italy. Indeed, it exists a recognized difference among South and North of Italy. The southern issue in the Italian context indicates an economic disparity due to cultural differences between the context of northern and southern Italy [34] . The different cultural context has an impact on the way people act, promoting habits that, for example, have relevance in the South and not in the North. Therefore, the meanings that make a habit existing are a complex and intertwined system of factors, as are the competences and materialities it takes to promote a change in energy habits.",

Competences are a critical resource for people who need to adapt to a new situation, such as a pandemic [10] . Competences, which some scholars also called human capital, allow people to make the best use of the technologies (or energy) available to them even during emergency situations, such as the use of the internet. The level and type of competences are certainly attributable to people's socio-demographic characteristics. For example, younger people usually have more skills in using new media. Material context and how people live and use the material context available to them are also important in understanding person's habits. For example, having gardens at home promotes outdoor stay for people, positively impacting on their wellbeing and health [35] . To understand how this approach can help us analyse the change in household energy uses during the lockdown, and thus to provide inspiration for new pathways to energy transition, this paper analyses the change in the habit of cooking. Indeed, cooking is one practice that all people share during the lockdown.",

The change of working mode [5] and media use were also relevant during the lockdown, affecting domestic energy use. An in-depth analysis of the change in people's habits due to new ways of working should be promoted, but in this paper the focus is on a residential energy practice for which there are numerous pre-pandemic literature references [33, 24, 36] and which seems to be the practice that has changed most in the daily lives of survey respondents (Section Results). Even if cooking is not the only household practice affecting energy use changed during the lockdown, it will be the focus of this study. Cooking is a social practice that links energy demand -e.g., electricity for oven or the induction hob, or gas for the stove -and (food) daily routines [36] . Concerning this activity, the existing scientific literature investigates modes of provision, meals, methods, and technologies (e.g., induction hob, gas or hydrogen provision technologies), while the focus of the paper is on the energy use linked to cooking. Cooking is also a cultural and social practice [37] , which is relevant for managing social needs, e.g. maintaining social relationships within households and reproducing cultural and social dynamics such as inter-generational and gender-based differences. Considering all these characteristics of the cooking activity, this paper reports the idea that it could have been an important activity in redefining the everyday life of households during the first lockdown in Italy. In any case, it is important to understand the context in which people live in order to understand how the activity of cooking has changed, starting from the cultural and geographical context already mentioned in the previous paragraphs.",

These studies concern the 'southern Italian issue' [38] . Chiesi [38] defines the 'southern Italian issue' as a 'reality, a reminder of the persistence of a serious structural and cultural dualism, a long-lasting phenomenon'. This issue has been exacerbated in the post-WW2 period, rather than having been reduced [39] . Geographic and cultural difference may also have affected the change in the energy practice of cooking during lockdown, giving for example a stronger meaning to cooking in one cultural context than the other e.g., in Southern Italy.

This work can contribute to the existing literature with a unique perspective that does not look at the amount of energy demand itself, but at the dynamics, preferences, and changing habits of people. These elements can be useful in explaining why energy demand changes and can direct more effective low-carbon pathways, promoting more sustainable energy practices. This study examines the reasons underlying emerging new energy demand profiles during the lockdown, going beyond the simple assumptions and hypotheses proposed by some authors in recent J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof months [7] . Thus, this work can stimulate new reasoning about the energy use and demand, through an analysis of the social and behavioural change.

First, the collected data are analysed using principal descriptive statistics to understand the characteristics of respondents, their houses and their households.

An independent chi-square test is applied to test eventual associations existing between different pairs of nominal variables. In order to detect the differences in ordinal dependent variable between paired observations (the respondent \"before the lockdown\" and the respondent \"during the lockdown\") the Sign-test is used 3 . This test is a nonparametric proposal for the paired-samples t-test. The hypothesis to be tested (H0) is that the answers about the time spent on an activity before versus during the lockdown have the same distribution and therefore do not J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof significantly change. A significant p-value indicates a statistically significant difference in distribution and that the time spent in an activity has changed. For all tests, the significance level was set at 0.05.",

Based on the literature and results of exploratory analysis the binary regression model is built in order to predict the probability of being in a group of respondents that increases the time spent on cooking, given the set of characteristics of interest. Generally, a binomial logistic regression is used to predict the probability that an observation falls into one of two categories of a dichotomous dependent variable based on one or more independent continuous or categorical predictors. In the presence of a dichotomous response, a variable logistic regression model is more appropriate than ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.

As a rule of thumb, predictors with VIF that exceed 2.5 should be examined; if greater than 10 they indicate serious multicollinearity issues. In this case, all the explanatory variables had VIFs below the critical value J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof of 2.5 (Midi et al., 2010) . Therefore, no independent variable needed to be removed [57] . Subsequently, by starting with all the predictors and applying the forward (Wald) variable selection procedure the best model was estimated. Entry stepwise probability at 0.05 was considered. Overall model evaluation tools such as the likelihood ratio, score, and Wald test were used to detect if the final model result was more effective than for the intercept-only model. The statistical significance of individual regression coefficients was tested using the Wald chi-square statistic. Finally, the inferential goodnessof-fit test, the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test, was applied to control if the model fit the data well.",

However, a notably large percentage of respondents (17.4%) is excluded from any working modes, and for this reason 'cooking' instead of working mode was selected as the focus for this paper. This is the opportunity to involve all the survey respondents in the analysis explained in the following paragraphs. The analysis confirms a statistically significant change in the amount of time spent in all the registered energy-related social practices at home (Table 2). The time spent running the oven and the induction hob, cooking, cleaning the home, having a shower, reading and chatting online, and watching movies all increased during the lockdown. As the time dedicated to almost of the daily energy-related social practices considered in the survey increased, an increase in energy demand in houses during the lockdown is assumed [7, 5] . However, some activities have not changed such as the use of washing machines. Given a general increase in energy demand [7] , the use of some appliances and devices has increased more than others and this may define people's preferences and reactions. The hypothesis is that energy use has changed differently among people depending on the resources available to them, specifically individual, household, and house characteristics and resources. Therefore, this paper tests different habits for cooking using a regression model based on individual, family and household factors. ",

In particular, living in a two-family or single house decreases the likelihood of increasing the time spent cooking, compared to living in a condominium. This could be attributed to different resources (e.g., a garden as cited by Corley et al. [35] or green space accesses, as reported by Uchiyama and Kohsaka [59] ), as well as possibilities (e.g., spending time isolated due to the presence of more rooms in a home) according to different types of house.

Those who are not working anymore and who are working at home (smart or tele-working) are more likely to increase the time dedicated to cooking, compared with those who continue working outside the home (Table 3) . Therefore, hypothetically, both groups of people increasing the time dedicated to cooking have increased the demand for energy. However, those who have also lost their jobs have reduced their ability to pay energy bills and may experience energy vulnerability and poverty [62, 19] .

This result may seem contradictory, but it acknowledges the fact that some indicators of energy poverty are important in explaining the change in time spent cooking in southern Italy. Further studies should be proposed to better understand these dynamics. While the regression model is not significant for Central Italy, other relevant differences among South and North Italy are related to the working mode. While in the South only the variable concerning 'Not working' can affect the change in time spent cooking, the variable concerning smart and tele-working is not relevant, whereas it is strongly relevant in North-Eastern (Sig.=0.008; Exp(B)=1.508) and North-Western Italy (Sig.=0.007; Exp(B)=1.843).

The proposed framework and its application during the first lockdown in Italy is contributing to the studies on social change. In order to have a wier understanding of the change in energy demand, energy use should be treated as a social and collective phenomenon [26] . In this sense, it should be considered that different paths of change are more suitable for certain groups of people who have certain socio-demographic characteristics, who live in certain housing and technological contexts, and who live in certain geographical locations. For example, the more people have classic appliances, the more time they spend cooking. This leads to an increased demand for energy, if the efficiency of appliances is not guaranteed. People living in large spaces with gardens can likely choose more activities, without increasing the time spent cooking as much as presented by the results. Further studies are needed to understand whether the size of the dwelling space has a significant effect on energy vulnerabilities. Such further studies can better guide the planning and design of housing renovations.",

Geographical differences allow to see that social and economic phenomena can impact differently in different contexts. This is the example of the spread of smart working. In the North, the place of work influences energy demand profiles, and this could in the long term have an impact both on decisions related to infrastructure (which will have to be ubiquitous) and on new needs for access to energy, which will have to be guaranteed to communities and individuals scattered throughout the territory.

It was expected that staying at home for more time means using more energy at home [7] . But it was not expected that more time was used for particular energy practices than for others.

First, a geographical difference in the Italian cultural, behavioural and economic context [38] could affect the paths of energy transition [64] , and this study confirms that it affects the change in time spent on the energy practice of cooking during the first Italian lockdown. The 'southern Italian issue' is a social issue, which could contribute to shaping the energy transition in Southern or entire Italy. Second, a gender-based perspective on social practice and energy use in the houses of the Western world could be relevant in best addressing the energy transition. Of course, a gender-based perspective should be integrated within the wider social context and household dynamics [26] . Anyway, this study confirms an influence of the gender variable on the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof change in terms of time dedicated to the energy practice of cooking. A potential inequality based on geographies and socio-demographic characteristics in terms of energy access by different households and different individuals must be taken into account both in policy decisions related to energy transition and in the research agenda. These results may be useful in interpreting the results of other studies that have focused on energy demand profiles [8, 21] .",

Regardless of these characteristics, the time spent on cooking can vary. Further research should be done to understand influencing changes in cooking practice and energy use are valid in explaining changes in other social practices and in other contexts.",
