A proposed marker of insufficient testing is the test positivity rate, with higher rates indicating insufficient testing in the community. A study of COVID-19 testing in New York (3) observed higher testing rates and lower test positivity in postal code areas with higher proportions of white residents and higher socioeconomic index. In contrast, higher hospitalization rates and COVID-19 mortality are reported in areas with lower socioeconomic position in the USA, as well as in Sweden (4) (5) (6) , emphasizing the need to implement effective test-traceisolate programs across all residential areas in a community.",

All these factors should be investigated and addressed in future test strategies.

In addition, we could explore the potential impact of area characteristics within a Swedish county with a uniform centralized testing strategy, testing recommendations, and test booking procedures. Some potential limitations apply. First, the aggregate data study design limits the application of our findings to individuals. Second, all testing data originates from a single county in Sweden, and we cannot ascertain that our findings are generalizable to the other twenty counties in Sweden with different testing strategies, population compositions and geospatial structures. As an example, distance to the nearest test station may be even more influential for example in the eight northern counties in Sweden that occupy more than twice the geographical area of Uppsala County. Third, our results may not apply to other countries with test strategies encompassing home tests, antigen tests, and/or screening of asymptomatic individuals.",

Since deprivation was highly correlated with foreign background in our study, we could not discern the potentially separate influences.
