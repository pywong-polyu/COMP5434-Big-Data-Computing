Along with the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the emerging field of Nutritional Psychiatry is seeking to address diet as a contributor to mental health. Nutritional Psychiatry research has shown that there is potential in using diet to prevent and treat certain mental health disorders [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Additionally, dietary interventions have been shown to improve mental health in several populations [5, 6, 8] . However, studies are lacking in their examination of this relationship in female collegiate athletes, despite the fact that they may have greater risk of experiencing anxiety, depression, and dietary insufficiencies [2, [9] [10] [11] [12] . Moreover, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic has impacted the lives of collegiate athletes in unique ways, which may increase their risk for dietary and mental health difficulties [13] [14] [15] .",

Student athletes encounter stressors beyond maintaining high academic performance that may precipitate depression, including sports injury, competitive performance, and career termination [1] . Due to the unique difficulties faced by collegiate athletes in the United States, the NCAA implemented the GOALS (Growth, Opportunities, Aspirations, and Learning of Students) survey in 2006. This survey is given to a subset of collegiate athletes across the nation every 4 years. A study utilizing GOALS data revealed that student athletes increasingly struggle with mental health issues, such as depression, with about 30 percent self-reporting that they have been overwhelmed during the past month [40] . A recent study by Wolanin et al. affirms the GOALS study results in its findings that 27.3% of Division I student athletes report clinically significant symptoms of depression [41] . Rates of mental distress among student athletes appear to be higher in women compared to men [12, 41] . Rice et al. found markedly higher rates of anxiety among female athletes than male athletes [42] .",

Buckley et al. identifies the COVID-19 pandemic environment as one that increases the risk of development of other behavioral health disorders (i.e., eating disorders), food preoccupation, and body dissatisfaction in athletes [14] . Additionally, Morrey et al. highlights the lack of control during the pandemic as a source of anxiety for athletes [43] . The NCAA Student-Athlete Well-Being Study [44] gathered surveys from over 60,000 collegiate student athletes in the United States in the Spring and Fall of 2020. The survey was taken by twice as many female athletes as male athletes within all three NCAA Divisions. The survey results revealed that student athletes were grappling with mental health issues such as feeling overwhelmed, lonely, anxious, hopeless, and sad. As many as 36% of female athletes identified COVID-19 concerns as factors that negatively affected their mental health. Similarly, Sanborn et al., in a study gathering data on the prevalence of COVID-19 anxiety among Division I student athletes, found that female athletes endorsed significantly higher levels of COVID-19-related anxiety, depression, and stress than male athletes [15] .",

The registered sports dietitian was present at every survey session to answer any survey questions arising during the surveys. Clinical psychology and counselling research assistants were available during each study session to answer questions and support athletes in case of distress.

The DASS-21 results indicated that approximately half of the athletes had scores 8 or above for depression and stress, and 3 or above for anxiety ( Table 2 ). Roughly half of the athletes were classified as having high/severe APSQ (50.6%; score 20 or above) and reported at least one item on the COVID-19 contamination fears scale from the CSS (53.2%; Table 2 ). Over 1 / 3 of participants reported at least one item on the CSS traumatic stress symptoms scale (35.1%). Significant differences in HEI for several of the mental health measures were found ( Table 2) . For the DASS-21, a significant difference in HEI was found between participants who reported low and high stress (low stress = 56.1, high stress = 62.6, p = 0.015). For the APSQ, a significant difference was found for performance concerns (57.5 vs. 62.5; p = 0.048).

This may be better understood by considering the concept of contextual body image in female athletes [54, 55] . Contextual body image refers to the difference in an athlete's body image within her sport as opposed to outside of her sport. For example, a tall, muscular female athlete may be proud and accepting of her body while on the volleyball court, but embarrassed and conscientious of her height and weight while at a social event unrelated to her sport. The COVID-19 transitions displaced athletes from their sports, thus, placing the socially acceptable body image at the forefront, which may have contributed to the increase of disordered eating and eating disorders [14, 55] . These body image conflicts add yet another unique mental health struggle related to nutrition and diet quality for female collegiate athletes.",

Becker et al. discusses research identifying athlete personality traits that lend well to competitive performance as well as to increasing risks of stress, anxiety, and disordered eating [2, 10, 32, 57] . A significant proportion of athletes tend to be competitive and perfectionistic in many areas beyond sport, including academics [10] . How participants with these personality traits perceived the DHQ-III questionnaire could have affected their answers. For instance, in efforts to \"get a good score\" or demonstrate knowledge of higher quality food choices, these athletes could have chosen answers they knew to be correct, but were not true to life. The phenomenon of response bias may have significantly affected the diet quality scores; thus, alternative modalities of estimating dietary quality outside of self-report should be utilized in future research.",

The body mass index (BMI) assessment was created to predict the potential of chronic diseases associated with obesity [58] . As a measure of weight relative to height, the BMI does not assess fat mass and fat-free mass (FFM). Its classification system was derived from the general population while many collegiate female athletes can be taller and more muscular. Therefore, BMI is not an accurate assessment of adiposity in this population with higher FFM [58] [59] [60] . In addition, the use of BMI in relation to eating disorders is somewhat problematic. Although identifying eating disorders is beyond the scope of this study, it is important to note that a low BMI measurement is associated with Anorexia Nervosa, yet individuals with Binge-Eating Disorder and Bulimia Nervosa may have normal or higher BMI measures [61] . It is difficult to unilaterally connect BMI with the presence of eating disorders. This, along with the body composition of female athletes, creates multiple confounding variables which negatively influences the accuracy and validity of BMI [27] . This study intentionally excluded the use of BMI because of these inherent problems.",

Another strength is the inclusion of all women's sports teams across 6 months of sport seasons. Further, researchers collected information on multiple components of mental health utilizing validated assessment tools. Limitations of the study should also be considered when interpreting findings, including the self-administration method of the questionnaires, which introduces bias. Another limitation is the possible bias introduced by the random nature of attention provided by research staff during questionnaire completion. That is, only participants that asked for clarification or assistance on questionnaires were provided with assistance by research staff. Collegiate athletes are also very busy juggling sport practice, classes, studying, homework, and employment, as well as community and social activities. The DHQ-III is a lengthy questionnaire requiring~45 min to complete and participants may have rushed through the survey, resulting in inaccurate HEI scores. Further the combined time required to answer all questionnaires was longer than recommended [62] . We acknowledge that some evidence supports an association of menstrual phase and mental health and that the lack of these data is a limitation of this study [63] [64] [65] . It is also recognized that body composition data would strengthen future studies of the relationship between diet quality and mental health. Lastly, this pilot study did not include a large enough sample size to adequately guard against a Type II error (false negative) or for results to be considered representative of all female athletes. Future studies should include larger, more representative samples of female Division I athletes.",

Each of the sections contain seven items divided into subscales. The scores are added together for each section. The depression scale assesses symptoms of dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest/involvement, anhedonia, and inertia.",
