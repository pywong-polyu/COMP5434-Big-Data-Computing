            "text": "Background: Visualizing and comprehending 3-dimensional (3D) neuroanatomy is challenging. Cadaver dissection is limited by low availability, high cost, and the need for specialized facilities. New technologies, including 3D rendering of neuroimaging, 3D pictures, and 3D videos, are filling this gap and facilitating learning, but they also have limitations. This proof-of-concept study explored the feasibility of combining the spatial accuracy of 3D reconstructed neuroimaging data with realistic texture and fine anatomical details from 3D photogrammetry to create high-fidelity cadaveric neurosurgical simulations. Methods: Four fixed and injected cadaver heads underwent neuroimaging. To create 3D virtual models, surfaces were rendered using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, and segmented anatomical structures were created. A stepwise pterional craniotomy procedure was performed with synchronous neuronavigation and photogrammetry data collection. All points acquired in 3D navigational space were imported and registered in a 3D virtual model space. A novel machine learning-assisted monocular-depth estimation tool was used to create 3D reconstructions of 2-dimensional (2D) photographs. Depth maps were converted into 3D mesh geometry, which was merged with the 3D virtual model's brain surface anatomy to test its accuracy. Quantitative measurements were used to validate the spatial accuracy of 3D reconstructions of different techniques. Results: Successful multilayered 3D virtual models were created using volumetric neuroimaging data. The monocular-depth estimation technique created qualitatively accurate 3D representations of photographs. When 2 models were merged, 63% of Frontiers in Surgery | www.frontiersin.org 1 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 878378 surface maps were perfectly matched (mean [SD] deviation 0.7 \u00b1 1.9 mm; range \u22127 to 7 mm). Maximal distortions were observed at the epicenter and toward the edges of the imaged surfaces. Virtual 3D models provided accurate virtual measurements (margin of error <1.5 mm) as validated by cross-measurements performed in a real-world setting.",

The acquisition of this knowledge and its successful clinical application require years of practice in the operating room and anatomical dissection laboratory. However, both of these training resources may be limited by institutional resources. Furthermore, residents' work-hour restrictions, decreases in cadaver availability, and the interruption of hands-on training courses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the difficulty of acquiring appropriate anatomical training for neurosurgeons. However, the advent of new technology that enables 3D rendering of neuroimaging has allowed the development of 3D virtual models that can be used to augment neurosurgical education. Such tools have been shown to improve performance and have become a complementary part of neurosurgical education when access to cadaveric specimens is restricted and will likely achieve more integration and impact upon neurosurgical training (1) (2) (3) (4) .",

            "text": "New advances in imaging, computer vision, image-processing technologies, and multidimensional rendering of neuroanatomical models have introduced extended-reality educational tools, such as virtual and augmented reality, into neurosurgeon training (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Photogrammetry and related technologies may complement advanced tomographic neuroimaging studies (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and computed tomography [CT] ) by providing detailed surface information of neuroanatomical structures. Stereoscopy, which is commonly used for neurosurgical education (7) (8) (9) , is the process by which two 2-dimensional (2D) photographs of the same object taken at slightly different angles are viewed together, creating an impression of depth and solidity. Photogrammetry is a technique in which 2D photographs of an object are taken at varying angles (up to 360\u00b0) and then overlaid using computer software to generate a 3D reconstruction (10) . In a previous study (1) , a 3D model of a real cadaveric brain specimen was created using photogrammetry and 360\u00b0spanning. Although this technique is very practical and useful, it is limited to objects that can be scanned in 360\u00b0. Unfortunately, in most surgical scenarios, the surgeon or trainee can only visualize a portion of the surgical anatomy, usually through a narrow corridor. Thus, more practical photogrammetric approaches are needed to overcome this barrier. Recently, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool was developed to estimate monocular depth, which potentially makes it possible to convert 2D photographs into 3D images. We believe that this tool can be used to overcome limitations and bridge the gap between neuroimaging and photogrammetry scanning technologies.",

We hypothesized that current imaging, photography, computer vision, and rendering technologies could be effectively combined to maximize the use of cadaveric specimens for education, surgical planning, and research. This innovative approach aimed to not only enhance neurosurgical anatomy training but also create a new digital interactive cadaveric imaging database for future anatomical research. If this attempt is successful, a cadaveric specimen would no longer have to be discarded after fixation and dissection. A cadaver could instead be digitalized and passed along from generation to generation in the same condition in which it was first dissected. Herein, we describe and validate our novel methodological paradigm to create qualitatively and quantitatively accurate 3D models.",

After the development phase, the second phase of the study included validation of this novel methodological approach by matching agreement between surface maps. Four embalmed and injected cadaver heads were used for method development (n = 3) and quantitative validation (n = 1). We initially used 3 heads to optimize the methodological pipeline. Once optimized, we applied this pipeline to produce the virtual model in 1 head for this proofof-concept study. Importantly, all heads used in this study were of the highest anatomical quality.",

Second, various forms of photogrammetry technology can supplement these 3D models with more realistic surface information, such as fine anatomical details, color, and texture. Third, neuronavigation can be used as a medium to connect, communicate, calibrate, and eventually combine these two 3D technologies. Lastly, all these technologies could potentially pave the way for more integrated and immersive neurosurgical simulations.

Also, cadaveric dissection is the gold standard for training neurosurgeons because it allows surgical techniques to be demonstrated, provides a unique experience with a wide range of sensory inputs, and creates necessary surgical skills (12, 13) . These skills include depth perception, 2D and 3D vision orientation, sensitive movements in limited environments (14) , bimanual coordination, and hand-eye coordination (15, 16) . In fields such as chess, music, sports, and mathematics, studies on human performance have shown that attaining an expert performance level requires about 10,000 hours of focused practice (17, 18) . To obtain 10,000 hours of practice in a certain field, a person would have to dedicate 5 hours/day, 6 days/week, 48 weeks/year for 6.9 years (18) . This equates to the time needed to graduate from a neurosurgical residency in the United States (7 years). A significant percentage of hours can be efficiently spent in a cadaveric dissection laboratory. However, access to such laboratories is limited due to a global shortage of cadavers, increasing costs of cadaver materials, and fewer dedicated anatomy laboratories, as well as the recent coronavirus pandemic. All these factors have contributed to decreased availability and use of cadavers worldwide (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . As a result, these recent limitations have paralleled the rapid adoption of new technologies to replace cadavers in anatomical training and international collaborations to maximize the use of the existing cadaver supply (19, 20, (24) (25) (26) .",

De Benedictis et al. (36) reported quantitative validation of photogrammetry for the study of white matter connectivity of the human brain.

In addition, Roh et al.

The technique provides spatially accurate features by AI-based and machine learning-guided 3D reconstruction of a single 2D image. When this tool is trained with a massive database of 3D films, it outperforms competing methods across diverse data sets (39) .

Thus, we believe the proposed methodological pipeline can be used not only for cadaveric dissections but also for real surgical scenarios. Images taken from surgical microscopes can be exported and implemented in our proposed pipeline. Some microscopes even support robotic and tracked controlled movements that can acquire stepwise stereoscopic imaging to postprocess into a 3D environment showing real tissue color, texture, and surgical approach anatomy (40). In addition, one can supplement the fine anatomical details that are usually missed when reconstructing standard MRI or CT images. This refinement is achieved using neuronavigation as a registration tool during cadaveric dissections and pinpointing the exact location of a structure that is \"invisible\" on neuroimaging.",

Unless an anatomical structure is related to the underlying pathology of a live patient, it will not be exposed in surgery, and under no circumstance will unnecessary dissection be performed on a live patient to expose distant structures. In addition, live patients will have blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the surgical field, brain shift due to CSF removal, and brain pulsations that can interfere with the quality and precision of intraoperative imaging and registration. Fixed, injected cadaveric heads do not have limitations created by the real surgical environment. Working with cadaveric heads creates no immediate time limit. Cadavers can be dissected to show all desired anatomical structures. Also, using a cadaver creates no interference in measurements or registration caused by blood, CSF, brain shift, or pulsations as in live surgery.",

            "text": "Cadaveric tissue also has inherent limitations. Digitalizing a cadaver head before the irreversible physical dissection process allows for its repeated use via virtual dissections. This digital copy also provides an opportunity to continually improve the virtual model by acquiring cadaveric photos, even in standard 2D format with smartphones, professional cameras, or microscopes. While the actual cadaveric specimen is damaged from repeated use over time, it will give rise to a more complete and enriched digital cadaveric model dataset. Having such a dataset of cadaveric images and models will also enable novel anatomical measurements, simulation of different surgical approaches, and virtual dissections.",

For example, serial surgical exposure images (both macroscopic and microscopic) can be coregistered with neuroimaging data using either neuronavigation registration points or more reliable anatomical landmarks (e.g., superficial veins). Then, machine learning algorithms can be used to train AI with the overwhelming intraoperative photographic data so that the algorithm can accurately predict the texture and surface details of MRI-based 3D-rendered virtual models.",

            "text": "However, it should be noted that surgical exposure will always be limited by a craniotomy performed at one specific time in a live patient, whereas a cadaveric specimen can be freely explored through many craniotomies and approaches at different time points. Furthermore, when using a cadaveric specimen, more aggressive retraction and dissection can be performed to reach distant anatomical targets that are deemed not safe in a real patient or are being tested for feasibility. Virtual models can support learning by allowing numerous rehearsals, with skills then confirmed by actual dissections in a laboratory. Eventually, with optimization of our pipeline and future advances in 3D virtual technology, we believe that accurate and realistic 3D virtual models can be effectively applied to both cadaveric and real-life specimens. Our technology is developed and exists to augment neurosurgical training; we have no doubt that considerable practice dissecting the cranium and brain is mandatory to achieve technical excellence for the progressing neurosurgeon.",

It includes both modifications in already known technologies (3D modeling, navigation, and photogrammetry) and the introduction of new technology (AI-based monocular-depth estimation) into the field. However, the model has certain limitations. This model development pipeline is supported by our preliminary, proof-ofconcept study and should be validated with a larger number of specimens and by other groups. The process requires some expensive materials and tools, such as cadavers, neuroimaging, neuronavigation, and modeling software. However, we believe this methodology can be implemented in laboratories that already have these capabilities and resources, and those laboratories could then share their resources and outputs with others across the world who are in need of these valuable and innovative educational materials. Although merging 2 technologies to complement each other provides an exciting opportunity, this process may not be as easy as thought due to the complexity of underlying technical substrates and operational principles of each technology. This potential training tool will require the collaborative effort of surgeons, anatomists, imaging scientists, software developers, computer vision and image recognition specialists, and even graphic designers. The image processing procedures described in this study still require human effort and expertise, which restricts their efficiency but allows for personalization, revision, and modification. AI applications will likely generate more automatic or semiautomatic processes in the near future.",

We were able to successfully merge the 3D reconstructions from standard medical imaging (CT and MRI) and photogrammetry (including a novel technique not yet applied to any form of anatomy) with high accuracy. As a result, we produced a 3D virtual model that is both quantitatively and qualitatively accurate. We believe our methodological pipeline can supplement both neurosurgical training and education globally, especially in a setting where cadaveric dissection or operating room access is limited. With 3D virtual technology, we envision a future where neurosurgeons can learn relevant anatomy and practice surgical procedures in the comfort of their own homes and at the pace of their choosing.",
