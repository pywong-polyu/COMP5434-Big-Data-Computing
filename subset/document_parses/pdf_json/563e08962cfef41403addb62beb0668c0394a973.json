In this work, a novel self-organizing model describing diffusion over a lattice is introduced. Simulation results for the model's active lattice sites demonstrate an evolution curve that is very close to those describing the evolution of infected European populations by COVID-19. The model was further examined against real data regarding the COVID-19 epidemic for seven European countries (with a total population of 290 million) during the periods in which social distancing measures were imposed, namely Italy and Spain, which had an enormous spread of the disease; the successful case of Greece; and four central European countries: France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. The value of the proposed model lies in its simplicity and in the fact that it is based on a universal natural mechanism, which through the presentation of an equivalent dynamical system apparently documents and provides a better understanding of the dynamical process behind viral epidemic spreads in general-even pandemics, such as in the case of COVID-19-further allowing us to come closer to controlling such situations. Finally, this model allowed the study of dynamical characteristics such as the memory effect, through the autocorrelation function, in the studied epidemiological dynamical systems.",

According to this, systems sharing no common structures and features at all may demonstrate the same dynamic behavior; in the case of critical phenomena, this is expressed through the existence of exponents in scaling laws. A characteristic example of universality is the phase transition from quark matter to hadron matter, which exhibits exactly the same dynamics as the critical state of Ising magnetic models [26] . Thus, the research motivation for the present work was to investigate whether a self-organizing diffusion over a lattice could describe viral epidemics, with a focus on the case of COVID-19 disease-although the described model appears to be a general approach for describing the spread of virus infection over a population.",

The proposed model is very simple in terms of the implementation of specific diffusion rules and incorporates only one control parameter. On each site of the lattice, a quantity called charge is placed, and we investigate how this diffuses from site to site under the specific rules set by the implemented SODM. In the general form of the model, this charge could be any physical quantity, such as energy (charge), electric charge, sandpile-grain charge, information charge, stock market charge, etc. Additionally, the model is designed with providence for the activity levels of the sites and communication restrictions among them.",

This does not mean that viruses are spread over the lattice, avoiding a metaphor that is far from reality and in which concepts such as medical viral charge are involved, which have completely different properties from diffusion; for example, natural quantities such as energy, electric charge, etc. According to the above, the proposed approach cannot be included in any of the hitherto known categories of epidemiological models. It must be noted that, according to a work currently under preparation [27], self-organizing diffusion dynamics are indeed critical dynamics that are expressed through intermittency [28, 29] ; therefore, in this paper, we shall simply refer to self-organized diffusion without delving into the details of its dynamics (which is the subject of future work). The presented SODM focuses on the case of COVID-19 disease-although the described model appears to be a general approach for describing the spread of virus infection over a population. The study concentrates on the period in which restrictive physical contact measures were put in place. We describe the existence of equivalent quantities between the SODM and the epidemic phenomenon, which would result in the same qualitative and quantitative characteristics being present in both cases. An example of these quantities is the correspondence between the active sites in SOMD and the COVID-19 infected population in the real world. In this case, the presented results show excellent qualitative agreement between the proposed SODM and real-world data, while by adapting (fitting) the model to the epidemiological data from seven European countries with a total population of 290 million, excellent quantitative agreement emerges as well. These results further suggest that the self-organizing diffusion model (SODM) may be the simplest equivalent dynamical model that underpins the underlying mechanism for describing epidemics, and it appears to hold as a universal approach for viral epidemics. Finally, this approach is further supported by the calculation of the autocorrelation function for the paradigms of the seven countries studied, which was possible due to the existence of the simulating model (since real-world data do not provide the necessary number of points for calculations). Interesting results regarding the memory of the studied epidemic systems emerge.",

In this direction, diffusion rules similar to the sandpile model of Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) [1] have been imposed, and the critical slowing-down (CSD) phenomenon has been thoroughly studied-among other fields, in epidemiology [6] [7] [8] . Within this framework, the aim of a self-organizing analysis of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic globally using self-organizing maps has been accomplished [9] . Lately, besides self-organizing models, a variety of numerous other modeling (lattice model, network model, mathematical model, etc.) approaches regarding COVID-19 epidemics have been developed [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] ; among these, the compartmental SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered) models exhibit very interesting results, which are discussed below in Section 4. quantities called units of charge. Although the simplest case of a lattice-that of a square of side L-is initially utilized, the model is engineered in such a way that other geometries could be considered as well. The SODM is a very simple model based on two different kinds of nodes: active and inactive. The active nodes are those that can transfer charge to or receive it from their neighbors, whilst inactive nodes can only receive charge. Based on these, two fundamental quantities-the control parameter and the order parameter-are defined as follows:",

Notice that this procedure ensures that the remaining charge is always greater than or equal to zero. For instance, for n = 1 (level 1), each site may pass one-quarter of a charge unit (i.e., 0.25) to each of its four nearest neighbors, while the active sites are those for which q ij \u2265 n = 1; correspondingly for n = 3, as active sites are considered for those with q ij \u2265 n = 3, all sites with a charge of q ij = 0, 1, 2 are inactive sites. Thus, n defines the active sites, which are those with a charge of q ij \u2265 n in charge units, and the amount of the charge transferred from active sites to their neighbors is q ij = n/4 charge units.

As mentioned above, in an attempt to check the validity of our model, we have repeated the described procedure of data pre-processing and SODM model fitting for six more European countries: Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Greece. It is noted that all the countries imposed social distancing (restrictions of physical contact), with Italy not implementing them in a timely manner, and that Belgium and Greece have almost the same population. Since the proposed SODM is a very simple model, the definition of the proper simulation set of parameters included the initial charge density \u03c1 and the level of social distancing measures imposed. Consequently, it was necessary to investigate the initial charge density \u03c1 on the boundaries of the lattice and the level of restricting measures, which ranged from the case of no restrictive measures to 25% (transfer charge to 3 out of 4 nearest neighbors), 50% (transfer charge to 2 out of 4 nearest neighbors) and 75% (transfer charge from 1 to 4 nearest neighbors) limitations on physical contact.",

In Figure 5c , the model's fitting on the real data, according As mentioned above, in an attempt to check the validity of our model, we have repeated the described procedure of data pre-processing and SODM model fitting for six more European countries: Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Greece. It is noted that all the countries imposed social distancing (restrictions of physical contact), with Italy not implementing them in a timely manner, and that Belgium and Greece have almost the same population. Since the proposed SODM is a very simple model, the definition of the proper simulation set of parameters included the initial charge density \u03c1 and the level of social distancing measures imposed. Consequently, it was necessary to investigate the initial charge density \u03c1 on the boundaries of the lattice and the level of restricting measures, which ranged from the case of no restrictive measures to 25% (transfer charge to 3 out of 4 nearest neighbors), 50% (transfer charge to 2 out of 4 nearest neighbors) and 75% (transfer charge from 1 to 4 nearest neighbors) limitations on physical contact.",

The next country studied was the first to face a COVID-19 epidemic in Europe. Italy was struck in February 2020 and did not impose social distancing measures in a timely manner; on the contrary, these were imposed in a later stage of the epidemic spread and did not include an immediate total lockdown. For this reason, the attempted SODM simulation did not include any restrictive measures of physical contact for the first 120 sweeps, while for the rest of the studied period, these were set to 50%. The initial density, providing a good fitting of the model to real data, was \u03c1 = 0.386.

Figure 8c , the model's fitting to the real data according to the described methodology (each day corresponds to 11 sweeps) shows excellent agreement. Spain was the second European country (after Italy) to be struck by COVID-19, and it at first reacted slowly, allowing for an initial rapid and aggressive epidemic spread.

Finally, in Figure 10 , the epidemiological data and the SODM simulation results appear in the case of Greece, for the period before 1 July 2020, when restrictive measures of all kinds ceased. Greece is a noteworthy case because it successfully faced the challenge set by the COVID-19 epidemic, demonstrating an extremely low number of incidents and deaths. Specifically, enhanced restrictive measures in the form of a total lockdown were implemented quickly. The result of such a policy is clearly depicted in Figure 10a , where the pre-processed COVID-19 data for Greece are shown. The derived SODM simulation results are presented in Figure 10b and they also demonstrate a qualitative similarity. The data regarded the period after 5 March 2020. In this case, simulation results were produced with an initial charge density of \u03c1 = 0.0455 and a level of restrictive measures of 75% (the highest), since a total lockdown was imposed.

The studied countries demonstrated different epidemic evolutions due to different approaches or policies in facing COVID-19 and could be called representative cases. These results regarded countries that finally imposed restrictions on physical contact at various levels and scientifically document the view that they are indeed effective in controlling epidemics. This is clearly proven by comparing the case of Belgium (a medium scale of restrictions and not implemented in a timely manner) to that of Greece (strict restriction measures, reducing physical contact by almost 80%). Although they practically have the same population, both the peak and the duration of the epidemic were significantly reduced in the case of Greece (by an order of magnitude). Since during these difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic, controversy over the proper approach in managing this situation is present worldwide, the model offers a scientific documentation of the effectiveness of restrictions, beyond empirical studies.",

            "text": "Another issue investigated in this paper that enhances our understanding of the dynamics demonstrated by epidemics was the possible memory effect exhibited. An epidemic with a strong memory is a dangerous situation that could sustain the epidemic for a long time. This was investigated by calculating the autocorrelation function for all seven European countries (France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Greece). The first six countries demonstrated almost the same epidemiological characteristics. This was made possible by utilizing the results of the SODM, since real data points are not sufficient for such evaluations. It was found that all countries initially exhibited a strong memory during the rise of the epidemic, with Greece being less persistent. In the peak of the epidemic curve of each country, a separation of the correlations for each case appeared; that is, the peculiarities of each country emerged. During the relaxation of the epidemic, the memory effect weakened. An interesting observation is the fact that the autocorrelation function appears to offer a tool for classifying the level of restrictive measures on physical contact imposed by governing entities over sets of populations. It is demonstrated that countries with the same level of restrictive measures belong to the same family of curves regarding their autocorrelation graphs, further leading to the conclusion that the form of the epidemic's relaxation depends on the restrictive measures imposed.",

Since the general form of the SODM results is very close to the SIR curves, it would be interesting to investigate the connection between the two models and specifically the connection to the differential equation describing the evolution of the infected population (I). A good turning point could be to treat this differential equation as a Langevin equation. It is known that the Langevin equation can describe the order parameter of a second-order transition in critical phenomena [40] . In our model, the order parameter M(t) is the fraction of the active sites, corresponding to the infected population (I) of the SIR model, further providing a justification framework that is capable of explaining the similarities between the SODM and SIR models' similarities.",

            "text": "It seems that self-organization-a natural mechanism that is also applied in artificial (social, economic etc.) networks, due to its universal characteristics-appears to be applied in the case of virus-caused epidemics as well. The proposed novel self-organizing diffusion model (SODM)describing a universal diffusion behavior in the simplest way-was shown to successfully fit the COVID-19 epidemics in seven European countries-namely France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Greece-while it seems that it has the potential to become a generalized model, equivalently describing the dynamics of epidemics and their features. This is claimed because almost all the real epidemiological data curves appear to follow the same general form. Since the model is structurally engineered to include restrictive contact rules, the value of restrictive measures is also documented by the model. Finally, the model allowed us to study dynamical characteristics, such as the memory effect, according to the relevant epidemiological data and provided us with a tool for quickly classifying countries according to the average restrictive measures imposed. Additionally, epidemic forecasting (with a focus on COVID-19) is another issue which we intend to study, including studying of lattice-forms that offer more choices in scaling social distancing measures, etc. The upcoming second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic will provide us with new epidemiological data that will ultimately test the limits of our approach. Finally, it should be mentioned that, according to ongoing research into self-organizing diffusion dynamics, various interesting results emerge in the frame of universality, the most important of which being the fact that self-organizing diffusion is governed by the dynamics of critical phenomena expressed through intermittency [29] .
