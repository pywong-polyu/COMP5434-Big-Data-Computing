New anesthesia protocols for ambulatory surgery and enhanced recovery after surgery have been developed as well. The focus of these techniques and protocols has centered on patient satisfaction and pain control while minimizing the use of opioids. The field of ambulatory surgery and anesthesia continues to evolve, and regional anesthesia and its plane techniques are at the center of these changes. Recent Findings Recent research has shown that regional techniques contribute to better pain control and patient experience and may decrease patient readmission rates. The safety of these techniques has been validated when performed by experienced practitioners. New techniques such as the erector spinae block (ESP) have been studied in the setting of laparoscopic surgery with promising results. Summary Regional anesthesia techniques for patients presenting for laparoscopic surgery are safe and seem to provide benefits. Those are related to patient experience, pain control, and readmission rates. Different techniques can be applied to a specific type of intervention. Application of these techniques depend on the clinical picture and patient. Future research may help us clarify how these techniques may improve patient satisfaction and operating room efficiency. New regional blocks may also develop based on what we know today.",

            "text": "Following nausea and vomiting, pain is the most common reason for hospital admission after laparoscopic surgery [1\u2022] . Pain associated with laparoscopic surgery is multifactorial, including visceral, incisional, and referred pain components. Visceral pain is a complex condition that can be caused by mechanical traction, dilation, spasm, inflammation, ischemia, and chemical stimulation [2] . Peripheral regional anesthesia techniques for laparoscopic surgery mainly focus on management of incisional rather than visceral pain. Thus, patients with moderate to severe acute visceral pain (e.g., patients with acute cholecystitis or following more invasive laparoscopic surgeries such as bowel resection) may benefit more from neuraxial rather than peripheral regional anesthesia techniques (i.e., epidural, paravertebral, and intrathecal blocks). Recent regional techniques have been developed to address visceral pain while avoiding the potential complications associated with neuraxial techniques such as bleeding, infection, and spinal cord injury. These \"more midline\" peripheral block techniques (e.g., erector spinae plane and quadratus lumborum blocks) may address both visceral and incisional pain.",

The number of ambulatory surgeries has increased steadily and surgeries that once required hospital admission can now frequently be performed in an ambulatory setting. For example, 60% of cholecystectomies are now performed in ambulatory surgery centers [5] . It is expected this number will increase in the coming years, and this trend may be hastened as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some authors have gone as far as suggesting that ambulatory appendectomy could become the standard of care [6] . It is not only new surgical approaches that have made these trends possible, but also new anesthetic drugs and regional anesthesia techniques. Nausea, vomiting, and pain are frequently the greatest impediment to ambulatory surgery. Thus, addressing pain with non-opioid medications and regional anesthetic techniques may provide better pain control while minimizing the undesirable side effects associated with opioid analgesics and, thereby, facilitate surgery in an ambulatory surgery center setting [1\u2022] .",

Traditional laparoscopic surgery is based on the concept of triangulation, which facilitates organ exposure and ergonomics. Over the last 20 years, clinicians and patients have experienced its benefits. However, new trends in outpatient surgery have created demand for anesthetics tailored to laparoscopic surgery. For example, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) [7] has been recently used for several common procedures such as appendectomy and cholecystectomy. SILC involves a 2-cm incision into the umbilicus between the T7 and T11 intercostal nerves [8] . This evolving technique will likely require more evidence prior to its wide utilization. However, the apparent benefits include reduced pain, risk of bleeding, surgical site infection, visceral injury, and port site herniation. Given the potential reduction in pain associated with SILS, anesthetic techniques will need to be further refined for these surgeries, should they achieve widespread utilization.",

Nevertheless, there is still significant potential for pain following laparoscopic surgery. Injury to the skin, abdominal musculature, peritoneal lining, and viscera may contribute to this pain. The anatomy of the peritoneum is complex and must be understood for a proper understanding of the pain associated with laparoscopic surgery. The parietal and visceral peritoneal linings have distinct embryologic origins and, therefore, differing innervation. The parietal peritoneum derives from the somatopleural layer and, thus, is innervated by the associated dermatomes [9] . Conversely, the visceral peritoneum is derived from the splanchnopleural layer and is innervated by the autonomic nerves supplying the visceral organs. The differing embryologic origins of the parietal and visceral layers of the peritoneum give rise to distinct pain sensations.",

As a result of this self-amplifying cell signaling cascade, pain experienced following laparoscopic surgery may last considerably longer than the primary painful stimulus. These changes that occur in the central nervous system make the case for preoperative and thus preemptive interventions to manage pain before an inciting painful stimulus. Preoperative administration of local anesthetics may attenuate or completely prevent these hyperalgesic changes in the central nervous system. Indeed, there is evidence that preoperative nerve blocks provide superior analgesia during the early postoperative period compared to the same blocks administered immediately postoperatively [10] .",

In fact, the early (first 24 h) pain and opioid requirements following laparoscopic surgery may be greater than those following open laparotomy [11] . However, after this immediate postoperative phase, the relationship is reversed, with pain worse in patients who underwent laparotomy. The varied sources and types of pain produced by laparoscopic surgery call for a multimodal approach to analgesia flowing these surgical procedures [12] . And, the more marked early pain associated with laparoscopic surgery would seem to suggest that single-injection peripheral nerve blocks with a long-acting local anesthetic (i.e., bupivacaine) may alleviate much of the severe postoperative pain after laparoscopic surgery and facilitate same-day discharge.",

            "text": "Understanding the anatomy of the abdominal wall [13, 14\u2022] is essential for a regional anesthesiologist employing techniques that can be of used to provide analgesia following laparoscopic surgery. The anatomy of the abdominal wall consists of multiple layers of muscle; each of which is surrounded by its own fascia [15, 16] . Various muscles make up the abdominal wall: Lateral to the vertebral column, the quadratus lumborum, psoas major, and iliacus muscles reinforce the posterior aspect of the wall. The caudal ends of the psoas major and iliacus muscles pass into the thigh and are major flexors of the hip joint. There are 4 paired muscles of the anterior and lateral abdominal wall [13] : the anterior rectus abdominis muscles, and from deep to superficial, the 3 lateral muscles: transversus abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique muscles. In the lateral abdomen, the three bellies of the oblique muscles, transversus abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique, overlie one another. Medially, these three muscles insert into the aponeurotic linea semilunaris just lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle. The shape and location of the muscular bellies and the linea semilunaris help identify the layers which are the main reference for the different variations of transverse abdominis plane (TAP) blocks. Anteriorly, the rectus abdominis spans the distance between the thoracic wall (superiorly) and the pelvis (inferiorly). Structural continuity between posterior, lateral, and anterior regions of the abdominal wall is provided by thick fascia posteriorly and by flat tendinous sheets (aponeuroses) derived from muscles of the lateral wall. A fascial layer of varying thickness separates the abdominal wall from the peritoneum, which lines the abdominal cavity.",

It is comprised of three layers: anterior, middle, and posterior fascia, and is wrapped around the erector spinae and quadratus lumborum muscles. The anterior layer of this fascia is located posterior to the erector spinae and is also the initial aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi. The middle layer separates the erector spinae and the quadratus lumborum muscles. While the middle and anterior layers meet at the lateral border of the erector spinae, the posterior layer covers the anterior boundary of the quadratus lumborum. The three layers of fascia converge at the lateral border of the quadratus lumborum to form the initial aponeurosis of the internal abdominal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. It is believed that the thoracolumbar fascia acts as a pathway for local anesthetic spreading to the paravertebral space, and for the distribution of the spinal nerve branches (the lateral branches of posterior branch of L1-L3 spinal nerve) and sympathetic fibers [17] .",

The T6 to T11 spinal roots give rise to the intercostal nerves and T12 to the subcostal nerve. The L1 spinal nerve root becomes the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves. The T6 dermatome is a small area below the xyphoid. The T7 and T8 nerves pass toward the xyphoid, parallel to the costal margin. Anterior intercostal nerve branches arising from T6 to T8 form beneath the rectus muscle and traverse variable distances between the posterior rectus sheath and the transversus abdominis muscle in the TAP before penetrating anteriorly through the rectus sheath. After a further course between the rectus sheath and rectus muscle, they pass into the muscle. However, there are exemptions where T6 to T8 nerves may pass directly into the rectus muscle near the costal margin. In this anatomic variant a block placed between the rectus abdominis muscle and the posterior rectus sheath close to the midline may miss these nerves [17, 18\u2022] . Each segmental nerve has a lateral branch that leaves the main nerve posteriorly, near the angle of the rib, and passes with it a short distance. The lateral branch then emerges obliquely through the overlying muscles around the midaxillary line. These branches arise before the nerve enters the TAP, although the T11 and T12 lateral branches may have a short course within or through the TAP. The ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves have a different course than the thoracic nerves. These nerves remain deep to the transversus abdominis muscle until the middle one-third of the iliac crest (measured from anterior superior iliac spine to posterior superior iliac spine); anterior to this, they are usually found in the TAP.",

However, bupivacaine and ropivacaine delivered to the intrathecal and epidural spaces have a relatively short duration of action, measured in minutes when administered intrathecally as opposed to hours for perineural administration [19, 20] . Consequently, epidural or intrathecal local anesthetics must be administered by continuous infusion via an indwelling catheter when utilized for postoperative analgesia. While thoracic epidural infusions provide outstanding analgesia following laparoscopic surgery, there are numerous disadvantages to epidural analgesia [21, 22] . Chiefly among these is the requirement for inpatient admission and monitoring precluding the use of this modality in ambulatory surgery. Additionally, epidural analgesia is associated with risks that include profound hypotension, epidural abscess, and hematoma resulting in spinal cord compression. For these reasons, thoracic epidural analgesia is ideally utilized for laparoscopic surgeries that will themselves necessitate hospital admission (e.g., laparoscopic colorectal resections). For major laparoscopic colorectal surgery, thoracic epidural analgesia may decrease not only pain and opioid consumption, but also the time to gastrointestinal recovery, while improving tolerance of oral intake [22, 23] .",

            "text": "The presence of opioid receptors in the spinal cord allows for intrathecally or epidurally administered opioids to exert a local effect at the level of the spinal cord [24] . This produces dense analgesia while limiting the deleterious effects of systemic opioid administration. In contrast, opioid receptors are not found in the peripheral nervous system. Nevertheless, studies comparing the addition of opioids to local anesthetic based peripheral nerve blocks have found mixed results [25] . Some authors have shown benefit to addition of opioids to peripheral nerve blocks, while others have demonstrated no benefit beyond what is observed with systemic administration [26] [27] [28] . Morphine is the most commonly used opioid for intrathecal administration due to its prolonged effect compared to more lipophilic shorter acting opioids such as fentanyl. Intrathecally administered morphine, which may be administered in combination with local anesthetic or alone, decreases pain and reduces the need for systemic opioid therapy following laparoscopic surgery [29, 30] . However, as with systemic administration, intrathecally administered opioids produce respiratory depression in a dose dependent manner. Intrathecal morphine is also associated with other opioid related side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and pruritus [31] . Morphine administered intrathecally exhibits a bimodal pattern of respiratory depression, with an early phase (approximately 2 h following administration) and a late phase (usually 6-12 h but may be as late as 24 h). The late phase of respiratory depression is the result of rostral spread of the hydrophilic morphine molecules within the cerebrospinal fluid to the respiratory drive centers of the brain [32] . Thus, patients require monitoring for approximately 24 h following surgery. This makes intrathecal morphine an excellent analgesic option for large surgical procedures necessitating hospital admission but precludes its use for ambulatory surgeries. When used as part of a multimodal ERAS protocol, intrathecal morphine may also facilitate earlier discharge following large laparoscopic surgeries [29] .",

These blocks target local anesthetic lateral to the epidural space where the spinal nerve roots emerge. Paravertebral blocks, in contrast to local anesthetic injections in the intrathecal or epidural spaces, have a duration of action that may be well matched to the pain following many laparoscopic surgeries. Thoracic paravertebral blocks, with or without ultrasound guidance, have been shown to decrease both pain scores and opioid consumption in the first 24 h following laparoscopic cholecystectomy [10, 33, 34] . Unfortunately, paravertebral blocks often require multiple bilateral injections as there is generally only a 1-2 dermatome level spread with each injection [35] . Each of these injections is associated with approximately a 0.3-0.5% risk of pneumothorax [36, 37] . Thoracic paravertebral blocks are also associated with profound sympathectomy, as the sympathetic innervation to both the heart and splanchnic vasculature are anesthetized. Thus, there is great need for more peripheral regional anesthetic techniques that are appropriate for use in an ambulatory setting and have limited side effects and risks.",

However, it is important to note that many of the commonly used adjuvants for peripheral nerve blocks are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for perineural injection [38, 39] . As described above, opioid receptors in the spinal cord allow for epidurally and intrathecally administered fentanyl and morphine to exert a local effect, decreasing the need for systemically administered opioids. Results of studies comparing the addition of opioids to peripheral nerve blocks have been mixed with some finding benefit to perineural administration of opioids and others no benefit. Lidocaine, ropivacaine, and bupivacaine are the most researched and utilized local anesthetics for peripheral and neuraxial blocks. This is due to their availability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics. For abdominal plane blocks, a larger volume of more dilute local anesthetic is used compared to conventional peripheral nerve blocks or neuraxial techniques. This is due to the need for the local anesthetic solution to \"hydro-dissect\" the targeted plane and anesthetize the nerves running within.",

While the most severe pain following laparoscopic surgery is in the immediate postoperative period, there is often pain that persists for days after surgery [11] . Continuous peripheral nerve blocks (CPNBs) utilize a catheter that is inserted-usually under ultrasound guidance-either adjacent to a peripheral nerve or into the plane targeted for an abdominal plane block [42, 43] . Local anesthetic may be infused for several days via this catheter, resulting in a peripheral block whose duration is measured in days, rather than hours. Patients at risk for prolonged pain (e.g., chronic opioid users, undergoing larger procedures, surgical drains left in place) may benefit from continuous infusions as opposed to single injection blocks. For abdominal plane blocks, relatively large, automated boluses may allow for more spread of local anesthetic than traditional continuous infusions of local anesthetic [44, 45] .",

Patient satisfaction was assessed by The Global Satisfaction Score (GSS) for analgesia within 48 h. The group found that ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks of the abdominal wall can significantly relieve postoperative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, in the study, patients receiving LAI expressed more satisfaction than patients in whom other methods were used. A 2018 meta-analysis and a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis on TAP blocks for laparoscopic rectal surgery [8, 47] showed that TAP blocks can lead to a lower pain score at rest within the first 6 h and reduced opioid consumption within the first 24 h, compared to no regional anesthetic pain regimens. Although TAP blocks may be associated with a reduced time to first bowel movement, patients receiving TAP blocks may not experience a shorter length of hospital stay (LOS) or a decrease in the incidence of nausea and vomiting. It is important again to mention that (LOS) is hard to measure as there are internal practices that affect patient discharge including surgeon's preferences, social issues and, the potential need for additional rehabilitation. In terms of nausea and vomiting again, the definitions vary by place as well as how the data is recorded in the medical record [48] . Selcuk et al. [49] studied the effect of the effects of preemptive and pre-closure analgesia on postoperative pain intensity in patients undergoing different levels of laparoscopic gynecological surgery. He found that the preclosure analgesia improved postoperative pain intensity during its half-life in both levels of surgery, which differed in terms of extent of visceral peritoneal dissection, operation time, and degree of manipulation. According to his results pain after laparoscopic gynecological surgery is mainly related to the parietal component.",

Ramkiran et al. [52] studied the usefulness of a rectus sheath block-OSTAP block combination, OSTAP block alone, and conventional port site infiltration in improving postoperative pain after LC. In this study, pain scores were significantly lower in the combined block group at the second postoperative hour. In addition, opioid consumption in the postoperative 24 h was significantly lower in the combined block group. It is important to notice that OSTAP does not reliably cover the lateral and posterior abdominal walls and that explains why study results are mixed and not all patients benefit from it.

RSB was associated with significantly lower rest pain scores at 0-2 h postoperatively than control. Also, RSB significantly reduced pain scores at rest at 10-12 h postoperatively and on movement at 0-2 h postoperatively, 24-h opioid consumption, and opioid-related side effects. Preoperative RSB provided better pain control compared with postoperative block administration. In the setting of laparoscopic surgery, RSB seems to improve pain control for up to 12 h postoperatively and reduce opioid consumption, without major reported adverse events. The fact that the block was done preoperatively may help explain the effect of the block in the first 12 h. It is hard again to prove an association with pre-emptive analgesia.",

In his study, he found that ultrasound-guided ESP block reduced postoperative tramadol consumption and pain scores more effectively than oblique subcostal transversus abdominis block (OSTAP) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery. OSTAP covers dermatomes T6-T10, while ESP has been shown to be effective at covering both somatic and visceral pain. One of the theories that have been postulated as a reason for this is that in cadaveric studies, an injection of local anesthetic solution at the low thoracic level may extend anteriorly and enter the thoracic paravertebral space. A recent report of 3 cases show that it is possible for the local anesthetic to reach the rami communicantes that transmit fibers to and from the sympathetic ganglia and block visceral pain while also blocking somatic pain by blocking the ventral and dorsal rami of spinal nerves [55] . There is also spread of local anesthetic to the epidural, neural foraminal, and intercostal areas improving pain coverage.",

The group receiving the combined blocks had significantly lower postoperative use of PCIA and rescue analgesic than in the other two groups. This can be explained by the anatomy and coverage of dermatomes provided by each technique. As many other have pointed out a single technique may not be enough to cover for all incisions and dermatomes, something that is better accomplished by neuraxial blocks.
