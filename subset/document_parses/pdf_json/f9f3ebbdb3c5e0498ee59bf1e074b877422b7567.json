Recently, a novel fluorescence-based LIFA test was developed for quantitative measurement of the total binding antibody units (BAU/mL) against the receptorbinding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-RBD). Aim: To evaluate the performance of the fluorescence LIFA Finecare TM 2019-nCoV S-RBD test along with its reader (Model No.: FS-113). Methods: Plasma from 150 RT-PCR confirmed-positive individuals and 100 prepandemic samples were tested by FinCare Tm to access sensitivity and specificity. For qualitative and quantitative validation of the FinCar Tm measurements, the BAU/mL results of FinCare Tm were compared with results of two reference assays: the surrogate virus-neutralizing test (sVNT, GenScript, USA), and the VIDAS\u00ae3 automated assay (BioM\u00e9rieux, France).

A strong correlation was observed between Finecare TM /sVNT (r=0.7, p<0.0001) and Finecare TM /VIDAS\u00ae3 (r=0.8, p<0.0001). Conclusion: Finecare TM is a reliable assay and can be used as a surrogate to assess binding and neutralizing antibody response post-infection or vaccination, particularly in none or small laboratory settings.",

Several commercial COVID-19 test kits were developed in response to this urgent need to detect either nucleic acid or antibodies (Van Walle et al., 2021). Although RT-PCR is used as a gold standard test, it requires specialized conditions, expensive equipment, and qualified personnel for sampling and testing. These limitations pose a challenge in a pandemic setting which requires rapid and reliable tests that can be used to screen populations (Dortet et al., 2021) . Thus, serological testing, particularly point of care approaches, such as the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), provides a rapid, portable, and coast effective method complementary to the RT-PCR.",

This is because both VIDAS\u00ae3 and FineCare TM detection methods are based on enzyme-linked fluorescent and target antibodies against the S-RBD domain. This is particularly important; the FineCare TM rapid antibody test could detect neutralizing antibodies and serve as a surrogate for the advanced automated immunoassays in clinical settings to measure the humoral immune response after vaccination or infection and research context. ROC curve analysis was also performed to determine the optimal cut-off indices for FineCare TM (Figure 2 ). The new cut-off value showed improved sensitivity without affecting the specificity. However, the cut-off values could be adjusted depending on the clinical setting or research context. For instance, in high-prevalence settings, higher thresholds may be desirable for screening purposes, whereas lower cut-off may be helpful for diagnosis purposes (Ismail et al., 2021) .",
