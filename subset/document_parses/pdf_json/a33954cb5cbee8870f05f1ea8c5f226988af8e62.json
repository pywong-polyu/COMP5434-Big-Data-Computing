After excluding questions by women with intrauterine fetal death (n=5), unrelated questions (n=376), and duplicate questions (n=659), we retained 1000 questions for analysis ( Figure 1) . The questions had a median of 360 (IQR 228-546) Japanese characters and yielded 12 categories and 20 constituent codes (Table 1) , which demonstrated strong interrater reliability (Gwet AC1=0.93, 95% CI 0.92-0.94). The total number of the codes was 1677 (median 1, IQR 1-2). Figure 2 shows the frequency distribution of the assigned categories and codes throughout the study period. The number for each category refers to the total number of applied questions and not the sum of the codes. Anxiety about going outdoors was most frequent, followed by anxiety related to work and anxiety related to infection among family and friends. Within the category \"going outdoors,\" anxiety or stress about infection in daily life (including going to work) was predominant, while in the category \"infection in family and friends,\" anxiety or stress related to undesirable activity was most frequent. Figure 3 shows the weekly changes in the frequency distribution of the anxiety categories and the chronology of key events among pregnant women in Japan. There were 3 peaks in the number of questions: the first peak occurred in the week of February 24, 2020, which coincided with the first wave of infection spreading from China; the second peak occurred in the week of April 6, 2020, which coincided with the sharp increase in infection with the second wave spreading from Europe and the United States; and the third peak occurred in the week of May 4, which coincided with the extended state of emergency. Infection-related anxiety (maternal infection, going outdoors, and infection among family and friends), and contributed to the first and the second peaks but declined during the third peak, during which anxiety about social support and mood disorders increased. Questions related to relationship stress were frequent throughout the study period. ",

            "text": "According to previous studies, many pregnant women were anxious about using public transportation and about infection among family members during the COVID-19 pandemic [14, 15] . Pregnant women and new mothers were also uniquely impacted by stress related to reduced social and emotional support or family conflicts during the pandemic [9] . The anxiety and stress identified in this study is consistent with those reported previously. During the outbreak, the prevalence of severe depressive or anxiety symptoms among pregnant women increased with an increase in the number of cases and deaths [4] . Further, up to 30% of pregnant women reported experiencing anxiety symptoms even during the remission phase [16] . Given these findings, our study suggests the need for different types of care for pregnant women during a pandemic; rapid intervention is warranted during early stages of infection spread, whereas long-term support is needed even as the infection begins to wane.",

In this study, pregnant women frequently posted questions regarding their anxiety and stress related to maternal infection during the early spread of the pandemic. It has been reported that among expectant mothers, anxiety was heightened upon learning about infected new mothers and the lack of information from their physicians [17] . Pregnant women may perceive risk uniquely because the risk of affecting offspring is likely to be deemed greater [18] . Health care providers should use a variety of communication channels and added information resources to distribute audience-specific health messages [1] . Our results further suggest the need for specific messages that target family and friends-undesirable behaviors in the people surrounding the pregnant woman account for most of the anxiety about infection in family and friends as well as for relationship stress. Through a constructionist approach, there may be a need for different types of messages for partners and family members.",
