The objectives of this short communication were 1) to assess the availability of WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs in seven provinces in Afghanistan before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) to elucidate the relevance of these patterns with the number of reported HCW infections from COVID-19 in the mentioned provinces. Methods: We analyzed secondary data from the 2018-19 Afghanistan Service Provision Assessment survey, which included 142 public and private HCFs in seven major provinces in Afghanistan. Data on COVID-19 cases were obtained from the Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health Data Warehouse. Weighted prevalence of WASH services and standard precautions were calculated using frequencies and percentages. ArcGIS maps were used to visualize the distribution of COVID-19 cases, and scatter plots were created to visualize the relevance of WASH services and standard precautions to COVID-19 cases in provinces. Results: Of the 142 facilities surveyed, about 97% had improved water sources, and over 94% had improved toilet for clients. Overall, HCFs had limited availability of hygiene services and standard precautions, which was lower in private than public facilities. More than half of the facilities had safe final disposal and appropriate storage of sharps and medical waste. Of the seven provinces, Herat province had the highest cumulative COVID-19 case rate among HCWs per 100,000 population and reported lower availability of WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs compared to other provinces. Conclusion: Our findings show disparities in the availability of WASH services and standard precautions in public and private facilities. Private facilities had a lower availability of hygiene services and standard precautions than public facilities. Provinces with higher availability of WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs had a lower cumulative COVID-19 case rate among HCWs per 100,000 population. Pre-pandemic preparation of adequate WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs could be potentially important in combating infectious disease emergence.",

            "text": "Provision of safe and sustainable water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services and practicing standard precautions is essential to prevent infection transmission among healthcare workers (HCWs), staff, patients, and clients of healthcare facilities (HCFs) [1, 2] . Ensuring recommended hygienic and environmental measures in HCFs helps protect the health and prevent person-to-person transmission of healthcare-associated infections during outbreaks of infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) induced Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1] . Exposure to microorganisms in healthcare settings occurs due to poor sanitary and hygienic conditions and inadequate standard precautions [2] , which are preventable. Proper WASH services and waste management act as a barricade to COVID-19 transmission in HCFs [3] . The prevalence of healthcare-acquired infections is estimated to be 15.5 per 100 patients in developing countries [4] . Patients and visitors can develop infections during their stay or visit to an HCF, and the number of infections increases dramatically during a public health crisis. A large proportion of infectious disease cases are attributed to unsafe healthcare settings [5] . The global community will not reach the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets for universal access to WASH (SDG 6.1 and 6.2) and universal health coverage (SDG 3.8) goals without meeting the indicators of WASH services in HCFs by 2030 [6] . A comprehensive assessment of environmental conditions (including WASH services and waste management) and availability of standard precautions in HCFs of 78 low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) revealed that most of the HCFs assessed had insufficient environmental conditions and basic standard precautions for preventing transmission of infections [2] . The evaluation focused on collecting further data in LMICs to explore the scope and distribution of inadequate coverage [2] . Furthermore, it is necessary to undertake an HCF readiness assessment to evaluate the preparedness of HCFs and improve response capacity. Data from an HCF assessment in 54 LMICs identified large disparities in the provision of WASH services and the availability of poor environmental conditions in HCFs [7] . Therefore, HCFs require a comprehensive preparedness and response plan to meet public health objectives for the prevention and control of infections [8] .",

These measures are considered essential for the protection of HCWs from infections due to contamination in HCFs [9] . Standard precautions are also necessary for all patients and HCF clients, whether they show symptoms or not. These practices include engaging in frequent hand hygiene with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub, wearing medical masks, using personal protective equipment (PPE), safely managing sharps waste and medical waste, disinfecting the surfaces and equipment, and regularly cleaning the environment in the healthcare setting [1] . Frequent hand hygiene and using face masks are key control measures that are widely recognized to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection by interrupting virus transmission [10] [11] [12] . The low availability of the standard precautions increases the vulnerability of healthcare users and staff to infections. Consequently, the risk of infection transmission increases during infectious disease outbreaks. In parallel with this, efforts to combat such outbreaks increase the demand for WASH service availability and the use of standard precautions.",

The prepandemic assessment of WASH services and standard precautions contribute to identifying the gaps in infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and establishing a firm response mechanism to tackle the pandemic effectively. An integrative review on the role of WASH in reducing COVID-19 transmission suggested that adequate WASH services should be integrated into response and recovery plans and with other relevant sectors [12] . Long-struggling Afghanistan also experienced the surge of COVID-19 and faced a crisis in early 2020 [13] . Several public health measures were put in place to curb the spread of the virus. However, hundreds of front-line HCWs across Afghanistan remain at a high risk of becoming infected with the virus, and dozens of them lost their lives fighting the pandemic. Little is known about the status of environmental conditions and availability of standard precautions in HCFs before the COVID-19 pandemic in Afghanistan. Therefore, this study aimed to 1) assess the availability of WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs in seven provinces in Afghanistan before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) elucidate the relevance of these patterns with the number of reported HCW infections from COVID-19 in the mentioned provinces. The findings from this study are expected to provide insights that have relevance for policy and practice.",

The survey collected information on the availability of essential healthcare services and facilities' general readiness to provide quality health services. The survey included public and private HCFs in urban areas of seven major and most developed provinces in Afghanistan: Balkh, Herat, Kabul, Kandahar, Kunduz, Nangarhar, and Paktya. In six provinces excluding Kabul, no sampling was involved, and all 12 public and 37 private hospitals plus 52 private clinics were included in the sample. In Kabul province, all 26 public and 20 private hospitals were included; however, of the 84 private clinics, 13 clinics were randomly selected for inclusion in the survey to normalize the total number of private clinics at the national level and provide nationally representative results according to HCF type. Of the 160 HCFs visited during the assessment, 18 facilities were permanently closed, unreachable, or refused to participate. Data were successfully collected from a total of 142 facilities (Fig. 1 ). AfSPA survey used five main types of assessment tools that include facility inventory, health provider interviews, client observation protocols, exit interviews, and countryspecific questionnaires. These validated assessment tools are widely used to assess the availability and readiness of HCFs in many countries. For this report, the data from the facility inventory dataset were analyzed. Variables for availability and readiness were identified according to the service availability and readiness assessment (SARA) manual [14] . The AfSPA datasets are available on the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) program website (https://dhsprogram.com/data/available-datasets.cfm) [15] . Data on COVID-19 cases among HCWs were also analyzed. Data were obtained from the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) Data Warehouse, which includes the period from the start of the pandemic (February 24, 2020) to November 03, 2020. ",

A previous assessment found that only 2% of HCFs in LMICs with data had adequate WASH and waste management services and standard precautions [2] . In our study, of the seven provinces surveyed, Herat province had the highest cumulative COVID-19 case rate among HCWs per 100,000 population and reported inadequate availability of WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs. Given the constraints of the limited resources to implement key IPC measures in LMICs, HCWs have a high risk of contracting COVID-19. According to World Health Organization, over 10,000 HCWs in 40 African countries have been infected with COVID-19 as of July 2020, where many HCFs were found to lack the core infrastructure required to adopt key IPC measures [20] . This may indicate that inadequate availability of the IPC measures in HCFs contributes to an increased risk of infection among HCWs, and precise information on these would help to make better decisions and better protect health [2] . Due to inadequate hygiene services and standard precautions, infection prevention measures are not fully implemented in HCFs within LMICs. Pre-pandemic preparedness is central to an effective response and recovery strategy and has potential implications for addressing priorities for future public health emergencies. A comprehensive review on WASH and COVID-19 transmission suggested incorporating WASH services into response and recovery plans and integrating the WASH sector with other relevant sectors to enhance prevention efforts [12] . Most WASH efforts are centered on reducing the spread of infection during a pan-demic; however, the pre-pandemic stage also provides opportunities for WASH efforts to decrease the risk of infection during the pandemic stage [12] . Furthermore, investing in WASH services in HCFs is one of the most cost-effective strategies to improve pandemic preparedness, particularly in low-resource settings [3] . Administrators at HCFs are recommended to use these insights to prepare comprehensive preparedness and response plans that include information on the availability of WASH services and standard precautions to minimize the healthcareassociated transmission of infections, especially during outbreaks.",

In 2020, the program was implemented in 200 health centers in five provinces (Herat, Kandahar, Badakhshan, Nangarhar, and Bamyan), and many of these health centers were declared as Model Health Centers (MHC) for WASH. The health centers are evaluated based on the proposed criteria set for MHC, including the availability of WASH services and regular hygiene and sanitary behaviors by health center personnel.

The limitations of this study need to be noted. Data on WASH services and COVID-19 cases originated from two different sources that were collected at different timepoints. It was not applicable to investigate statistical relationships among variables as the records from both datasets could not be linked. The level or size of the HCFs was not considered in the survey; nonetheless, the availability and readiness of certain WASH services and standard precautions would vary depending on the level or size of the HCFs. This can be explored analytically in future studies. Additionally, the data were from seven major and comparatively developed provinces, and most HCFs were private hospitals and clinics.
