The severity of dyslipidemia parallels the gradual decrease in renal function and this disturbed pattern of lipoprotein metabolism is seen even in the early stages of chronic renal failure (CRF) [6] . Dyslipidemia seen in CKD patients is highly atherogenic and is associated with development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and it is maximal in patients with ESRD. Dyslipidemia can even independently act as a predisposing factor for the progression of renal damage. The detrimental effect of dyslipidemia on the progression of CKD underlines a number of evidences including impaired blood supply due to atherosclerosis which further damages the kidneys [7] . It is a well known fact that the treatment of dyslipidemia plays a vital role in the prevention of CVD in the general population but its treatment in dialysis patients is still inconclusive due to lack of evidence [8] . Moreover there is limited research regarding the effect of single renal dialysis (RD) session on lipid profile in ESRD patients. So, it is rationale to conduct a study on ESRD patients to see the impact of hemodialysis on lipid profile.",

A similar finding was reported from a study done by Latha and Varma in Hyderabad, India, where the mean age was 48.27 \u00b1 10.24 years [10] . This may be reflective of the fact that ESRD affects the economically productive age group. Though this is in contrast with the study done in the Western population where the mean age was found to be >65 years. The reason might be the difference in incidence of diabetes and hypertension (common risk factors for CKD) along with other factors like genetic and socio-cultural factors, therapeutic process and the disease pattern causing CKD [11] .",
