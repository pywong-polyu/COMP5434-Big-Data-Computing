            "text": "Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a life-threatening complication induced by systemic inflammatory responses to infections, including bacteria and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. There are currently no immunotherapies with proven clinical efficacy and understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CRS pathogenesis is limited. Here, we found that patients diagnosed with CRS from sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or burns showed common manifestations: strikingly elevated levels of the four proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and IL-10 and the coagulation cascade activator plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Our in vitro data indicate that endothelial IL-6 trans-signaling formed an inflammation circuit for robust IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 production and promoted PAI-1 production; additionally, an IL-6 signaling blockade by the human monoclonal antibody tocilizumab blunted endothelial cell activation. Plasma from severe COVID-19 patients similarly exhibited increased IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1 levels, but these levels were not as high as those in patients with CRS from other causes. In contrast, the PAI-1 levels in COVID-19 patients were as highly elevated as those in patients with bacterial sepsis or ARDS. Tocilizumab treatment decreased the PAI-1 levels and alleviated critical illness in severe COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggest that distinct levels of cytokine production are associated with CRS induced by bacterial infection and COVID-19, but both CRS types are accompanied by endotheliopathy through IL-6 trans-signaling. Thus, the present study highlights the crucial role of IL-6 signaling in endothelial dysfunction during bacterial infection and COVID-19.",

            "text": "IL-6 | tocilizumab | endothelial cell | cytokine release syndrome | COVID-19 C ytokine release syndrome (CRS) refers to the state in which various cytokines are extremely elevated through excessive immune responses to bacterial or viral infections or tissue injuries. CRS is accompanied by different conditions, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell engaging therapy, and sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) (1, 2) . CRS is a harmful systemic hyperactivated immune state that can lead to vascular leakage, transaminitis, coagulopathy, multiple organ dysfunction, and death (3) . Various cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-8, are released during CRS (4, 5) . Despite accumulating information regarding CRS pathophysiology, general supportive care remains the pillar of treatment because a single therapeutic target for immunomodulation is ineffective (6, 7) . IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic functions (8) . It mainly signals through both classic-signaling and trans-signaling pathways, and the distinction is dependent on the expression patterns of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and gp130 on the surface of cells, such as immune and endothelial cells, respectively (9) . The IL-6R antagonist tocilizumab suppresses both classic-signaling and transsignaling pathways (8) . Recently, tocilizumab resolved HLH-like manifestations in CRS patients caused by CAR T cell therapy and viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2 infection (10, 11) . Notably, the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing worldwide, and this disease has a high mortality rate of \u223c5% (12) . However, no effective therapies have been found yet, and because the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 is still poorly understood, many physicians treat severe COVID-19 patients by following the sepsis treatment guidelines (12, 13) . Clinically, sepsis is associated with tissue edema caused by vascular leakage through damaged endothelial cells. Endothelial dysfunction is the principal determinant of microvascular dysfunction, as it shifts the vascular equilibrium toward more vasoconstriction, causing subsequent organ ischemia, systemic inflammation with associated tissue edema, and a procoagulant state (14) . However, it remains to be clarified whether the activation of Significance Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a life-threatening complication induced by hyperinflammatory responses. However, no specific immunotherapies are available for its treatment. In this study, we found that interleukin (IL)-6 signaling plays a crucial role in endothelial cell dysfunction during bacterial and viral CRS. Specifically, we identified that the pathogenesis of CRS in patients with sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and burns involved the IL-6-mediated production of hyperinflammatory cytokines and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which indicates that IL-6 signaling blockade has potential as a therapy for CRS. We also found that the inhibition of IL-6 signaling by tocilizumab treatment decreased PAI-1 production and alleviated clinical manifestations in severe COVID-19 patients. IL-6R signaling affects endothelial cells during CRS caused by bacterial or viral sepsis. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-6 signaling in the regulation of endothelial activation and its involvement in the pathogenesis of CRS.",

To determine the clinical implications of IL-6 levels for CRS severity, we examined the correlations between serum levels of IL-6 and those of other cytokines as well as of PAI-1. The relative levels of IL-6 were positively associated with those of IL-8, MCP-1, and PAI-1 (r = 0.6164, P < 0.0001; r = 0.5717, P = 0.0003; and r = 0.3823, P = 0.0234, respectively) in the sera of sepsis patients ( Fig. 2A) . In ARDS patients, the IL-6 serum levels showed significant positive correlations with the serum levels of endothelial injury indicators such as IL-8, MCP-1, and PAI-1 (r = 0.9372, P < 0.0001; r = 0.5074, P = 0.02574; and r = 0.6587, P = 0.0022, respectively; Fig. 2B ). We also found similar correlations between the serum levels of IL-6 and those of IL-8 and MCP-1 in burn patients, whereas serum levels of IL-6 and PAI-1 were not significantly correlated in these patients (Fig. 2C) . The correlation pattern of the three cohort CRS patients was different, but serum IL-6 levels were positively correlated with elevated IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, and PAI-1 levels in all CRS patients, which suggests that a common pathological pathway was responsible for the expression of these cytokines during CRS (Fig. 2 A-C) .

Based on these reports, we next investigated which cell types are involved in the IL-6-mediated production of inflammatory cytokines and PAI-1 during CRS. Endothelial cells express gp130 but not transmembrane IL-6R and produce IL-6 and MCP-1 upon several stimuli. Additionally, endothelial cells express Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which recognizes pattern-and damage-associated molecular patterns. Engagement of TLR4 causes robust IL-6 production in endothelial cells (22) . Next, we investigated the response of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone or in combination with soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) for the release of proinflammatory cytokines and PAI-1. We found that LPS and sIL-6R treatment induced a prominent increase in IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and PAI-1 production in an sIL-6R dose-dependent manner, whereas LPS alone induced these factors but to a lesser extent (Fig. 3A) . In this experiment other cytokines, including IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3, were not detectable (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B ). These results indicate that IL-6R trans-signaling is critical for production of several cytokines and of PAI-1. We also found that the treatment of HUVECs with IL-6 in combination with sIL-6R enhanced IL-6 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression (Fig. 3B) as well as the release of IL-8, MCP-1, and PAI-1 (Fig. 3C) , whereas treatment with IL-6 alone had a very limited effect. These findings indicate that IL-6 requires sIL-6R to induce the production of PAI-1 and proinflammatory cytokine in HUVECs.",

            "text": "To further elucidate the pathways regulating inflammatory responses and coagulation activation by IL-6 trans-signaling, we treated HUVECs with the pharmacological IL-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab and assessed the cytokine and PAI-1 expression after stimulating the cells with LPS or IL-6 in the presence of sIL-6R. Consistent with the results described in a previous report (24), we found that the treatment of HUVECs with tocilizumab prevented the trans-signaling-induced expression of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and PAI-1 (Fig. 3 D and E) . Overall, these results indicate that IL-6 trans-signaling forms an inflammatory circuit in the endothelium, and a blockade of this signaling prevents PAI-1 and proinflammatory cytokine production. Table S2 . These patients included one patient who was critically ill and required artificial ventilator management before they could be given a tocilizumab injection, two patients who rapidly progressed to respiratory failure within 2 d after tocilizumab treatment, and four patients who required oxygen inhalation before they could be given a tocilizumab injection. All seven patients recovered promptly from fever and malaise and displayed lower oxygen intake after receiving tocilizumab treatment.",

            "text": "To investigate the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we measured the circulating concentrations of 11 cytokines and chemokines and PAI-1 in COVID-19 patients before treating them with tocilizumab. Similar to our findings in patients with bacterial CRS, the serum concentrations of IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-10 in all patients with severe COVID-19 were significantly elevated compared with those in healthy controls (Fig. 4A) . The serum levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-10 in the severe COVID-19 patients were all relatively lower than the corresponding levels in our three cohorts of CRS patients (sepsis, ARDS, and burns). Although the circulating IL-8 concentration trended higher in the seven patients with severe COVID-19 compared with the healthy controls, the difference failed to reach statistical significance (Fig. 4A) . Several other cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-12p40, and IL-17, were not detectable in the severe COVID-19 patients. Notably, the severe COVID-19 patients who exhibited severe respiratory dysfunction had significantly higher levels of PAI-1 to a similar extent as those in patients with sepsis, ARDS, and burns (Figs. 4B and 1D) . These results indicate that, as in cases of sepsis and ARDS, a progression of endothelial cell injury occurs through elevated PAI-1 levels in cases of severe COVID-19. After tocilizumab treatment, the seven severe COVID-19 patients exhibited decreased serum PAI-1 levels and improved clinical features, including lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Thus, IL-6 signaling regulated PAI-1 production in severe COVID-19 patients (Fig. 4B and SI Appendix, Table S2 ). Furthermore, treatment with tocilizumab decreased the serum concentrations of IL-10, whereas the serum levels of MCP-1 was unaffected (Fig. 4B) . Because tocilizumab prevents the binding of IL-6 to IL-6 receptors, thereby increasing the serum concentration of free IL-6 (25), it is not surprising that the serum IL-6 concentration in the severe COVID-19 patients was increased after these patients were treated with tocilizumab.",

The features of COVID-19-mediated CRS are distinct from those of bacterial CRS: 1) COVID-19 patients have a relatively lower elevation in the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1 and 2) these patients have a similar elevation of PAI-1 serum levels, which can be decreased by the inhibition of IL-6 signaling. The present findings suggest that IL-6 signaling plays a central role in Previous studies have reported that the elevation in IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3 levels in CRS, including CAR T cell therapy and severe COVID-19, is a typical phenomenon in HLH/MAS, wherein activated macrophages or T cells are the major producers of proinflammatory cytokines (26, 27) . Consistently, our clinical data showed that IL-6 and IL-10 levels were significantly elevated in all enrolled CRS patients. These elevations may reflect macrophage activation. Our in vitro data indicate that IL-6 trans-signaling augmented IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and PAI-1 production and was blocked by treatment with tocilizumab in HUVECs. IL-6 generally activates the JAK/STAT3 pathway regardless of whether it binds to the soluble or membrane type of IL-6R through gp130 (8) . The IL-6-STAT3-nuclear factor \u03baB pathway augments IL-6 gene expression and partially induces MCP-1 and IL-8 expression in vascular endothelial cells (28) . However, the precise mechanisms by which IL-6 trans-signaling drives the expression of IL-6, MCP-1, IL-8, and PAI-1 genes remain to be clarified.",

Notably, the significant elevation in PAI-1 levels in patients with severe COVID-19, which is comparable to that observed in patients with ARDS, indicates the induction of vascular endothelial damages in these patients.
