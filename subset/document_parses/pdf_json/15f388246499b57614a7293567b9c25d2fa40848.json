The continued discovery of new anti-inflammatory drugs is crucial in the treatment of inflammation-linked diseases. Objectives Ferulic acid (FA), a precursor necessary for lignan synthesis, is widely distributed in plant-based whole foods and is a strong antioxidant. However, the effect of FA on the expression level of inflammatory factors in macrophages has not been fully clarified. The current study aimed to explore the anti-inflammatory effect and mechanism of ferulic acid.",

Compared with the control group, low (5 \u03bcmol\u00b7mL \u22121 ), medium (10 \u03bcmol\u00b7mL \u22121 ), and high (20 \u03bcmol\u00b7mL \u22121 ) concentration ferulic acid groups have decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis rate in a dose-dependent manner. FA reduced the transcriptional levels of Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Importantly, FAinduced autophagy and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 3-MA (a widely used autophagy inhibitor) enhanced the secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Moreover, autophagy inhibition by 3-MA resulted in increased proteins expression associated with NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. Besides, the inhibition of inflammasome activation by MCC950 reduced the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Conclusion It is concluded that FA enhanced autophagy, inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and reduced the expression and release of inflammatory factors.",

Currently, one of the most well-studied inflammasomes is NOD-like receptor-family pyrin domaincontaining 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome (Broz and Dixit 2016) . According to research findings, the full activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes requires two signals (Franchi et al. 2012 ). The first signal involves the interaction between TLRs and their ligands, the activation of NF-\u03baB and the synthesis of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and NLRP3 (Franchi et al. 2012) . The second stimulus leads to caspase-1 autoactivation, the cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2, and the release of mature IL-1\u03b2 (Franchi et al. 2012) . Appropriate concentration of lipopolysaccharide has been confirmed to provide two activation signals in human monocytes and macrophages and led to IL-1\u03b2 secretion (Petes et al. 2017; Tang et al. 2019; Zhao et al. 2019) . As a multifunctional inflammatory factor, IL-1\u03b2 performs both immunity and anti-infective functions by activating the expression of other immune genes and recruiting lymphocytes to the site of infection (Dinarello 2011) .",

During inflammation, a series of local reactions centered on the vascular system limited and eliminated injury factors, promoted the healing of damaged tissue and involves a network of cellular responses and cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 (Medzhitov 2008) . Generally speaking, the release of these inflammatory mediators is beneficial to the body, but excessive release of inflammatory mediators is harmful to the body, and is even closely related to a variety of inflammation-related diseases (Back et al. 2019; Mahmudpour et al. 2020) . IL-6 is an important inflammatory mediator with a pleiotropic effect on cancer progression, inflammation and immune response (Tanaka et al. 2014) . IL-6 is mainly synthesized and secreted by immune cells (T cells, monocytes macrophages) and non-immune cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells) during infection and tissue injury (Mihara et al. 2012) . Interleukin-1\u03b2 is a vital mediator of inflammatory response (Gabay et al. 2010; Lopez-Castejon and Brough 2011) . Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) is an inflammatory mediator produced by mononuclear macrophages during inflammation (Atzeni et al. 2020; Karki et al. 2021 ). This cytokine is not only involved in multiple intracellular signaling events leading to necrosis or apoptosis, but also important in the fight against infection and cancer (Atzeni et al. 2020; Karki et al. 2021) . In this study, the addition of LPS led to a remarkably increase in the mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, and the pretreatment with FA obviously decreased the mRNA expression of TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Ferulic acid is a kind of widely distributed phenolic acid, which is often cross-linked with lignin and polysaccharide to form part of the cell wall of plants (de Oliveira et al. 2015) . It was found that ferulic acid had strong antioxidant activity, and could scavenging hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical (Zhao and Moghadasian 2008) . At the same time, ferulic acid has also been proved to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects (Zhao and Moghadasian 2008) . FA also has been confirmed to be a promising substance protecting against high-fat diet-induced weight and 24 h and cell activity was detected by MTT assay. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, compared with the control group (3-MA 0 \u00b5M group).

            "text": "The inflammasomes are a class of macromolecular complexes that exist in the cytoplasm and are capable of sensing pathogenic microorganism infection, tissue injury and metabolic imbalance (Broz and Dixit 2016; Guo et al. 2015) . NLRP3 inflammasome is the most widely studied inflammasome, which is mainly composed of NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and procaspase-1 (Broz and Dixit 2016; Zhao and Zhao 2020) . When receptors perceive signals from pathogen infection, tissue damage, or metabolic imbalance, they recruit ASC and pro-caspase-1 to form inflammasomes, which in turn activate caspase-1 and induced the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 (Zhao and Zhao 2020) . At present, it is believed that the activation of inflammasome may be related to the occurrence of a variety of diseases, and further study of inflammasome may provide a new theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of related diseases (Guo et al. 2015) . In this study, it was found that FA down-regulated the protein expression Fig. 6 Autophagy regulated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in THP-1-derived macrophages. A THP-1-derived macrophages were treated with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 4 h in the presence or absence of pretreatment with FA (20 \u00b5M) for 24 h and 3-MA (1 mM) or MCC950 (10 \u00b5M) for 4 h.

Meanwhile, when MCC950 was used to inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, the release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 was significantly reduced. These results suggest that FA may downregulate the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes.",

            "text": "Autophagy is a biochemical process that takes place in cells all the time (Glick et al. 2010 ). Its function is to encapsulate damaged organelles and misfolded proteins through the formation of autophagosomes and transport them to lysosomes for degradation (Glick et al. 2010; Parzych and Klionsky 2014) . Many molecules have been shown to be involved in autophagy, including LC3, Beclin-1 and p62 (Glick et al. 2010) . In this study, the effect of FA on macrophage autophagy was explored, and FA-induced autophagy by increasing LC3 and Beclin-1 expression and decreasing p62 expression (Fig. 4) . To further clarify the relationship between autophagy and inflammation, 3-MA was selected to block autophagy. In this study, to further determine the appropriate concentration of 3-MA, the THP-1-derived macrophages were exposed to different concentrations of 3-MA (0, 200 \u00b5M, 400 \u00b5M, 800 \u00b5M, 1 mM, 2 mM, 4 mM, 8 mM) for 4, 12 and 24 h. Compared with the control group, 2, 4 and 8 mM 3-MA groups have significantly decreased cell viability (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3A) . Therefore, in subsequent studies, concentrations of 0, 200 \u00b5M, 400 \u00b5M, 800 \u00b5M and 1 mM were selected. To further clarify the effect of 3-MA on autophagic protein expression, we detected the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins in treated cells. As shown in Fig. 3B , with the increase of 3-MA concentration (0, 200 \u00b5M, 400 \u00b5M, 800 \u00b5M, 1 mM), LC3-II and Beclin-1 protein expression level decreased significantly. Considering the cytotoxic effect and inhibition efficiency of autophagy, 800 \u00b5M or 1 mM may be a reasonable concentration of 3-MA. More importantly, the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA activated the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and enhanced TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 release (Fig. 6) . It is suggested that FA, on one hand, inhibits the expression of ROS and on the other hand, induces autophagy to inhibit the activation of inflammasome, and ultimately downregulates the expression and release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2.",
