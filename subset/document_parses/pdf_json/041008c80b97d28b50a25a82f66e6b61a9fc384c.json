Methods: An analysis of prospectively collected registry data of all ED intubations over a 3-year period at an Australian Major Trauma Centre. During the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, we introduced modifications to standard practice to reduce the risk to staff including: aerosolisation reduction, comprehensive personal protective equipment for all intubations, regular low fidelity simulation with 'sign-off' for all medical and nursing staff, senior clinician laryngoscopist and the introduction of pre-drawn medications. Results: There were 783 patients, 136 in the COVID-19 era and 647 in the pre-COVID-19 comparator group. The rate of hypoxia was higher during the COVID-19 era compared to pre-COVID-19 (18.4% vs 9.6%, P < 0.005). This occurred despite the FAS rate remaining very high (95.6% vs 93.8%, P = 0.42) and intubation being undertaken by more senior laryngoscopists (consultant 55.9% during COVID-19 vs 22.6% pre-COVID-19, P < 0.001). Other adverse events were similar before and during COVID-19 (hypotension 12.5% vs 7.9%, P = 0.082; bradycardia 1.5% vs 0.5%, P = 0.21). Video laryngoscopy was more likely to be used during COVID-19 (95.6% vs 82.5%, P < 0.001) and induction of anaesthesia more often used ketamine (66.9% vs 42.3%, P < 0.001) and rocuronium (86.8% vs 52.1%, P < 0.001).",

The associated disease, COVID-19, may cause severe respiratory illness, and the virus is highly contagious, which has led to fears about the risks to healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in the care of these patients, particularly during aerosolgenerating procedures such as intubation. 5 In Australasia, the Safe Airway Society (SAS) released a consensus guideline, endorsed by numerous critical care and paramedical colleges and societies including the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, the College of Intensive Care Medicine and the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society with recommendations for improving the safety of this procedure. 6 The recommendations included modifications to standard practice which may reduce the risk of aerosol generation, such as avoiding the use of apnoeic oxygenation and limiting ventilation during apnoea; however, there has been concern that these changes may lead to an increased risk of hypoxia. 6, 7 On 17 March 2020, an extraordinary meeting of Alfred Health emergency physicians was convened to discuss how to best implement the recommendations of the SAS in our department to ensure the safety of HCW while maintaining optimal care for patients requiring EDI.",

            "text": "We hypothesised increased rates of hypoxia during the COVID-19 era as we had expected the virus itself to result in a higher proportion of patients with significant lung pathology. The proportion of patients with respiratory failure did not change, however, and we have only identified a single patient who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 intubated in our ED during this time. We must infer therefore that the increased rates of hypoxia are a consequence of the modifications to established standard practice. This is likely to be multifactorial but could include specific changes such as the removal of nasal cannula apnoeic oxygenation, 9, 10 avoidance of BVM ventilation during apnoea, and recommending a 60-s delay to laryngoscopy after muscle relaxant administration, 6 as well as a general shift in focus toward minimising aerosolisation to protect HCWs. In terms of positioning, patient's intubated supine during the COVID-19 era were also less likely to be positioned with a pillow or occipital raise which may have impacted preoxygenation and apnoeic oxygenation efficacy. While mild and temporary peri-intubation hypoxia is unlikely to have significant consequences for the individual patient, this finding is a concerning unintended consequence of the change in practice. On the one hand, it may be reasonable to tolerate higher rates of hypoxia if it protects HCWs from infection; however, in our setting where the incidence of COVID-19 is so low and the use of PPE so rigorous, this change warrants careful consideration. Going forward, the rates of adverse events may start to decrease as staff become more familiar with the 'new normal' practices, as well as through repeated reinforcement of the need to maintain focus on preventing hypoxia and hypotension through our monthly tailored education program. In addition, we have introduced a modified ventilator-assisted preoxygenation process, using continuous positive airway pressure for preoxygenation of patients at high risk of desaturation. 11 This study has limitations. Data were collected at a single trauma centre ED and the results may not be generalisable to other ED. Moreover, this is a pre-post study where the post-period is during a pandemic and, as such, the functioning of the department is likely to be altered in a number of ways that are difficult to quantify. In addition, the selfreported nature of the registry may have introduced bias as clinicians may have been reluctant to report failed attempts at intubation or adverse events.",
