Using a combination of surveys and leadership meetings, we clustered physicians according to who possessed the necessary skills in providing anticipated services during COVID-19 surge. The goal was to deploy individuals to clinical work areas that were most closely aligned with their skill sets and recent clinical activity, recognizing that everyone felt an initial level of discomfort with the care of a new disease. We identified attending physicians and house staff with prior experience in our critical care settings, recent experience with ventilator management, or with skills in inpatient care. We identified individuals with demonstrated emotional intelligence and leadership skills to support a number of training and information exchange functions. 2. Orientation and support. To support those entering new work environments and interacting with a new set of colleagues, we organized a specific 60-to 90-minute weekly virtual orientation to the service that included an overview of COVID-19 clinical care and strategies to streamline daily workflow. Leadership conducted walk-rounds to identify challenges and needs of the teams. 3. Multispecialty teams. To expand the capacity of inpatient services, we created new teams of non-IM faculty with IM house staff or non-IM house staff with IM faculty (Table) . On the ward services, this included faculty from neurology and pediatric hospitalists and house staff from pediatrics, neurology, psychiatry, and obstetrics and gynecology. This provided each team with physicians experienced with the workflow on the medicine services and the management of common comorbid conditions. 7 4. Weekly deployments assigned to a department or division. To simplify scheduling, and to allow departments and residency programs to organize their internal staffing needs, each new deployment was assigned as an ongoing weekly assignment for a specific department or division to cover. Individuals were assigned by the division or department, allowing these units to coordinate their ongoing schedules. For example, pediatrics was assigned a slot for attending coverage and 1 resident slot on 1 team, and the pediatrics department determined which specific attending and resident would be deployed on a weekly basis. 5. Cross-coverage support to resident deployments.",

First, they created \"ambassador\" positions; these individuals proactively rounded daily on the inpatient and later outpatient services, providing in-person updates to frontline staff and offering an opportunity for the workforce to raise questions and concerns. These roles were assumed by trusted members of the active and emeritus faculty, including surgery, pediatrics, IM, and radiology. Second, we assigned non-ID ambulatory providers to provide accurate, real-time testing guidance to both the emergency department and ambulatory COVID-19 testing centers, given the uncertainty and rapid evolution of guidance regarding COVID-19 risk assessment, testing algorithms, and initial limited testing capacity. Third, a team of surgeons and nurses provided real-time support with PPE, both for respirator fitting and for ensuring proper technique in donning and doffing in order to prevent self-contamination. (PUI) for COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 admissions. The first COVID-19 ICU team was located in the existing neurocritical care space, with a capacity of 15 patients. The SICU was the next ICU available to accept COVID-19-infected patients, with their usual staffing coverage of surgical intensivists, anesthesiology, and surgical house staff. The PICU was initially converted to care for those younger than 30 years with COVID-19, using its existing staffing structure, with support from the pulmonary consult team for adult care. With very few cases younger than 30 years in need of critical care, the PICU quickly transitioned to providing critical care to mostly adult patients with severe COVID-19. The cardiac care unit (CCU) service transitioned to a hybrid service of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases, managing complex cardiac patients including those on ECMO, those with pre-and postorthotopic heart transplants, and those with mechanical cardiac assist devices. Once these resources were utilized, we created 2 additional teams, converting a prior ward space into an ICU. These teams utilized both PCCM and anesthesiology at tier 1, with tier 2 covered by fellows and tier 3 covered by house staff from IM, anesthesiology, and otolaryngology. In addition, there were overnight PCCM and SICU attendings in residence each night.",

Nursing organized to cohort all COVID-19 and PUI patients on 2 specific floors, admitting or transferring those with negative tests to non-COVID-19 teams, to both conserve PPE and ensure geographic support to the providers assigned to provider safety and patient care. Because of increased IM resident and attending assignment to ICU services, the COVID-19 medicine services required additional staffing from non-IM residents and faculty. We addressed these needs by similarly developing plans for pairs of COVID-19 teams to care for patients on the same geographic unit to ensure the non-IM faculty had a \"buddy\" for quick questions or informal consults on patient care issues. One team in the pair was composed of a general IM attending, a junior IM resident, and 2 non-IM interns (otolaryngology and obstetrics/gynecology). The other team had a neurology or pediatric hospitalist attending, chosen because of their experience on inpatient wards and expertise in differential diagnosis and management of respiratory illnesses. They were supported by a senior IM resident, an IM intern and a resident from their own department. Because COVID-19 symptoms overlap with so many other conditions, most admissions were labeled as PUI for COVID-19, until more rapid testing allowed for this determination soon after admission. Because of the multiple transitions of care, and the frequent overnight deterioration of respiratory status of patients, we created an overnight COVID-19 team, dedicated strictly to covering the existing COVID-19 patients and admitting new COVID-19 patients or PUI. This night team included 1 IM attending and 2 senior IM residents; this team would evaluate new admissions and facilitate transfers both to the ICUs if patients decompensated overnight and to non-COVID-19 services if a patient under investigation was ruled out for COVID overnight. Palliative care physicians assumed a proactive role in patients with hospitalizations of greater than 5 days or critical illness, maintaining continuity of communication with family and patient and supporting care progression consistent with patient and family preferences. Their role was critical in the context of numerous provider transitions as patients transferred between services and as physicians' rotations were shortened in order to provide respite and reduce burnout.",

Those deployed demonstrated initial concern about having the appropriate skill set to provide care for this patient population. This training and support was critical to ensuring everyone had the confidence that they could succeed in the job asked of them. This lesson applied to both house staff and faculty, especially those from non-IM services asked to staff a medicine team. Key features of the orientation included training on COVID-19 care, knowing how to access consultants, especially in critical care, nursing, and IDs, and knowing the escalation pathways if patients had a clinical deterioration. 2. The success of deployments: Adaptability, problem solving, and an ability to rapidly assimilate into an unfamiliar work environment seemed more important than specific skills in the success of deployments. Identifying and deploying thought leaders and physicians with flexibility for supporting roles such as ambassadors were significant factors in the success of deployment for an entire service. 3. With several weeks to prepare for the peak in cases, we stood up services, allowing teams time to develop the processes for proper and safe use of PPE, to assign which team members would examine which patients, and to develop an order to daily tasks. 4. We identified the value of developing a scalable, modular model of the care team and then replicating as many times as needed. As care needs became more critical, deployments could then be completed quickly. 5. We identified early-on the need for work spaces for existing and new teams that allow for physical distancing while maintaining proximity to the patient care areas. Visitor restrictions created space in family waiting rooms. 6. The deployment process benefited from the close support by, and regularly scheduled huddles between, IM chief residents and the chief residents of deployed non-IM house staff to identify and quickly address concerns and ensure that all house staff deployments adhered to work duty hours. 7. Central deployment: We centralized deployment decisions to eliminate deploying the same persons or making multiple concurrent demands of a small cohort of physicians. 8. While we initially requested completion of individual skill set assessment and daily schedules, in the end, these were not helpful. We needed to deploy as teams in rotation for each position, not pick out specific individuals. 9. The blurring of the traditional academic departmental silos resulted in greater interdisciplinary teamwork, new collaborations across departments, and efficiencies in care. Two examples of this increased efficiency in teamwork included having an obstetrical resident on a COVID-19",

We focus here on the deployment of the physician workforce, which occurred in tandem with additional deployment of nursing, technicians, pharmacy, and respiratory therapy, to name some of the examples. Discussion was needed with leadership across the organization to ensure we conducted redeployments in tandem and built systems that supported the entire workforce. For example, the leadership rounds served to train and support the entire workforce, and nursing and respiratory therapy reported on the benefits to their staff of the additional daytime and nighttime faculty coverage. 11. While we disbanded many standing conferences and didactic activities, we identified ample opportunity to teach. Weekly Department of Medicine Grand Rounds on care of COVID-19 via videoconferencing reached up to 10-fold normal attendance including trainees and faculty from other departments, with extended question-andanswer periods through the video chat feature. Many of us reflected on the lessons we had learned in prior epidemics on how to think through the management of a new disease and how to deal with one's own uncertainty and fear in the face of a potentially fatal contagious disease. Many faculty members drew analogies to learning to trust the mask and plastic shields against this pathogen the way we had to learn to trust wearing gloves and universal precautions for blood drawing during the initial phases of the AIDS epidemic. 12. One of the key lessons learned was the need to manage stress at all levels. Any new contagion without known treatment requires medical personnel to take a certain level of personal risk, and with that, inevitable anxiety and uncertainty for themselves and their families. Many of these anxieties were reflected in the concern over PPE policy, as we had limited supplies, and evolving data on which procedures and care required what protection. Discussion sessions, which allowed individuals to voice their own discomforts and share examples of their own concerns, were some of the strategies to help one another deal with the uncertainty. 13. The fact that most patients in the hospital had the same disease allowed for standardized teaching and accelerated learning, facilitating safe care by noninternists.

We anticipated that the bulk of responsibility of handling patients with COVID-19 in the second surge would rest within the Department of Medicine and spent the intervening months training additional faculty members to serve on inpatient services and hiring additional critical care faculty. We have found the prior lessons on physician deployment provided insight into ensuring a specific focus on physician well-being and sustainability.",
