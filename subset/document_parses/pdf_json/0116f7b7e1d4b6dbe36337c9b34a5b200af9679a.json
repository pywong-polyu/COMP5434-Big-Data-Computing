            "text": "Even after 13 months, our world is still battling with global pandemic COVID-19. The pandemic has already infected more than one hundred and three million people, killing about two and a quarter million of them. Recently, several vaccines to inoculate people against the ongoing pandemic have been approved. People in most of the countries are being injected with these vaccines. While the world awaits for the outcome of the ongoing vaccinations, a more aggressive strain of coronavirus is killing many people in several countries, including the UK, the USA, Netherland, South Africa, and Australia. The ongoing pandemic has severely affected almost all aspects of our lives; education being one of them. As a result, majority of students in the world have completely lost access to the traditional way of institutional learning, while others have suffered in different ways and to a lesser degree. Many universities, colleges, and schools were closed during the initial pandemic lockdown during March-May, 2020. Luckily, some higher education institutions were better equipped to switch over to online teaching, either using a Learning Management System (LMS) or use some other online tools to connect with their students. With the help of surveys of students and teachers from several countries, this article aims to analyze the damage caused to the education sector by the pandemic at the global level. Guided by our literature review, and analysis of responses to our two surveys, we also provide a framework for a national education system, which could withstand future global crises like the one created by the COVID-19, and ensure continuity of education to all, especially the poor sections of the society.",

The United States of America tops the list with over twenty six million infections and nearly four hundred and forty thousand deaths, followed by India, Brazil and the UK, all loosing over one hundred thousand people to According to the head of the Communicable Diseases Control (CDC) of the United States of America [2] , the number of people in the country who have been infected with the coronavirus is likely to be at least ten times of the number of confirmed cases. Another report [3] suggests more than 23% of people in Delhi (New Delhi), the capital of India, were exposed to coronavirus. This makes more than five million people in just one city of India, which is not as affected as Mumbai, India's financial capital. Many other reports [4, 5] suggest that the actual number of infected people may be quite high. That being the case, the number of COVID-19 infected people by the end of August 2020 could be close to half a billion people, making it the worst pandemic on record.",

A section of them did not know what to do, whereas others did not have adequate means to act decisively. No one knows how long the current pandemic would last or when another pandemic or other catastrophe would be like this in the future. The occurrence of other crises is expected, sooner or later. The lesson we all must take from COVID-19 is to prepare ourselves to face off the next crises when it hits. In particular, the education entities worldwide and their governments should devise an educational system that sustains the shocks of future crises. It is a debatable question, where the world should strive for a global educational framework of L&T or individual instructions should do it for themselves. There are arguments to support both models, which we shall further discuss later in the article.",

Some of the higher education institutions were able to provide online L&T material through their websites or provide instructions in a distance learning mode. However, most of them failed to conduct proper virtual classes due to their poor ICT infrastructure. The case of primary and higher secondary students' education was even more disastrous as most of them lost all access to education by their institutions. Their examination was either postponed indefinitely or canceled altogether. A study by UNESCO in 2013 [8] found that sub-Saharan African researchers revealed only 1% of research contribution. This region spent only 0.4% of its GDP on R&D, compared to the global average of 1.7%, even though the region houses 15% of the world population. These statistics point out the difficulties the region faces to impart education and use a virtual class system for the region's younger generation. More information about the educational difficulties of African can be found in [9] . Egypt, Ghana, South Africa, and Rwanda were partly able to online platforms to impart university students' education. In some cases, these universities facilitated students with data packets and laptops.",

Total sample sizes of 76 instructors and 300 students were initially collected. Out of the teachers, there were 38 (51%) male and 36 (49%) females, and out of students, there 156 (51%) male and 145 (49%) females. We got a response to our surveys from fourteen countries in Asia, Africa, the US, and Australia. After all invalid observations have been removed, the final sample size is 74 instructors and 298 students. This method was used because the authors expect the data to be missing completely at random and have sufficient statistical power [16] . The instructors' ranged from lecturers to professors having qualification of doctorate 51%, master 42%, and 7% bachelor's degrees. The sample's nationality was 34% from Saud Arabia, 28% from India, and 38% from the other countries. The student sample size adheres to the recommended ratio of 15 observations per variable and the preferred minimum sample size of 105 observations to run the analysis in this study, as suggested by [15] . The participants were 51% male and 49% female. Their education level was respectively doctorate 9%, master 31%, bachelor 50%, associate degree 5%, Some College Credit 1%, and High School 4%. Table 1 shows the means, standard deviations, correlations, and reliabilities estimates of the study variables. The Impact of COVID-19 on learning was found to be positively correlated with online learning issues, the teacher and student's interaction during online classes, the instructors' response to face-to-face classes (r = 0.37, p \\ 0.01, r = 0.36, p \\ 0.01, and r = 0.25, p \\ 0.05, respectively), also the impact of COVID-19 on learning was found to be negatively correlated with the benefits of online classes (r = -0.28, p \\ 0.05). The online learning issues was found to be positively correlated with the teacher and student's interaction during online classes and the instructors' response to the need for national system for learning and to face-to-face classes (r = 0.46, r = 0.33, and r = 0.34, all at p \\ 0.01, respectively). The teacher and student's interaction during online classes was found to be positively correlated with the instructors' response to faceto-face classes (r = 0.54, p \\ 0.01), also the teacher and student's interaction during online classes was found to be positively correlated with instructors' response to the need for national system for learning to the online classes (r = 0.24, and r = 0.26, p \\ 0.05, respectively). The benefits of online classes were found to be positively correlated with the instructors' response to the online classes (r = 0.24, p \\ 0.05), also the benefits of online classes were found to be negatively correlated with the instructors' response to virtual classes in emergencies (r = -0.26, p \\ 0.05).

Finally, the students' response the hybrid classes was found to be positively correlated with the students' response to the online classes (r = 0.24, p \\ 0.01). An overwhelming majority of respondents have praised the efforts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) to combat COVID-19 threat and manage the pandemic in an efficient way which has seen very low numbers of infections compared to the other countries of the region. Moreover, Saudi Arabian universities in general, and the King Abdulaziz University in particular have ensured continuity of education even during the most difficult and early stages of the current pandemic. Insights into the educational, social, cultural and economic life of the KSA can be found in [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

But for those who lack internet or electricity cannot benefit from the online classes. In some cases, electricity and the internet are available, but the student cannot afford laptops or other suitable electronic devices to receive online content. In these circumstances, the government must have a system of loans or otherwise to ensure that all students have a suitable device to receive online instructions. Mobile phones are not considered to be suitable for learning through virtual classes. It becomes the national governments' duty to ensure that all students have the means to access online lessons and can afford the equipment required for online learning.",
