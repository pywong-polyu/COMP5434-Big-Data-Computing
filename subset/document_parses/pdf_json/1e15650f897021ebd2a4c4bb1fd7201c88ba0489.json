Patients with reduced NBC only, had fewer NE episodes, while patients with NP, or with both NP and reduced NBC were more likely have frequent NE. Multivariate analysis confirmed that: BMI; neurogenic causes; sub-scores of SUI QoL and bedwetting domain; the presence of reduced NBC, and both NP and reduced NBC; and bladder outlet obstruction, were all independent predictive factors for the severity of NE.",

NE is a common problem among children and adolescents, and the prevalence of NE has been reported as 10%, 3.1% and 1.3% at the ages of 7, 11-12, and 16-17 years, respectively [2] .

NE can be either primary, which is further stratified into persistent (never dry for >6 months) and recurrent (dry for > 6 months before adulthood recurrence) subtypes based on symptom continuity; or secondary to lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunctions, neurogenic conditions, psychiatric disorders, sleep apnoea, metabolic disturbance, and certain medication consumption [6] [7] [8] . Although studies have investigated the symptoms and urodynamic features of NE in adults, some key evaluation outcomes have been missing, and in particular, the bladder diary, which is a useful method in assessing LUTS, as recommended by the guidelines [9] . In order to understand the associations between clinical evaluation indices and adult onset NE, a more systematic assessment appeared necessary, encompassing medical history, comorbidities, subjective symptom appraisal, bladder diaries and video-urodynamic studies (VUDS). Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the value of comprehensive investigations on clinical features of NE in adult males, and to determine whether there are any predictive factors that could improve our current assessment, understanding, and management of this clinical condition.",

All patients were screened and evaluated by a single urological specialist (Q.X.S) to ensure the highest level of consistency. A verbal consent was obtained from each patient prior to performing the tests. A thorough clinical history was taken to confidently distinguish NE from other causes of nocturnal UI. We used the following criteria when recruiting our patients: (i) the complain of unintended voiding during night-time sleep (in other words, the bedwetting occurs due to patients failing to wake up to void); (ii) NE occurring at least once per week; (iii) and with a symptom duration of \u22653 months [1, 6, 10] . Urine analysis was done to exclude concurrent UTI, and physical examination was performed to exclude palpable mass, potential malignancies, and anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract. Any serious medical conditions, such as heart and kidney failure, recent cerebrovascular accident, etc., were carefully screened out. To eliminate the effects of nonstandard sleep patterns, nightshift workers were also excluded.",

A detailed analysis of nocturia episodes showed that >90% of patients reported a nocturnal frequency of \u22652 times ( Figure 1B) . Overall, we found that 41.9% of the cohort patients had NE co-existing with either UUI, SUI, or mixed UI.

We found that the enrolled patients with NE had either NP alone (14.0%), reduced NBC alone (34.9%), both (32.5%) or neither (18.6%): NP and NBC were calculated from the bladder diaries. VUDS demonstrated six (14.0%) completely normal patients, three (7.0%) patients with urodynamic SUI (post prostatectomy or cerebral infarction), and five (11.6%) patients had opened bladder neck during filling (either after prostatic procedures or cerebral infarction).

Table 3 and Appendix S2, we performed subgroups analysis stratified by age, BMI, NP, reduced NBC, and NE episodes. Not surprisingly, older men had larger prostate volumes, more voiding symptoms, worse QoL scores, and nocturnal frequency, but without any significant difference in NE-related parameters. It was noted that obese patients (BMI \u226524 kg/m 2 ) had significantly higher nocturnal bedwetting sub-scores, more NE episodes/week, along with higher incidence rates of reduced NBC and comorbidities.

[4, 5] . Although insufficient arousal mechanisms during sleep are an essential part of NE, NE may be caused by multifactorial aetiologies, such as LUT dysfunctions, neurogenic diseases, psychiatric medications, and sleep disorders just to name a few [6] . Apart from the lack of attention and available research data, published studies have focussed on either clinical symptoms or urodynamic characteristics, without providing comprehensive evaluations on quantified symptoms, bladder function, and comorbid conditions. Therefore, in the present study we attempted to fill this gap. With strict screening criteria, the present study recruited 43 adult males who sought a medical consultation for NE by a single urologist during a 2-year enrolment period. Most of our present cohort had a high BMI, which was an independent predictor of NE frequency, as evidenced by the multivariate analysis. This is consistent with the finding that high BMI is associated with high prevalence of NE in studies based on women and children [20, 21] . In our secondary NE subtype, there was a strong association between neurogenic factors and NE episodes. However, this was not identified in those on psychiatric medications, or with prostate surgeries. It is well known that neurogenic conditions may lead to a variety of VUDS abnormalities, such as opened bladder neck during filling, reduced compliance, SUI and chronic urinary retention, which could jeopardise the night-time continence mechanisms.",

[4] have reported a lower prevalence of these symptoms in one epidemiological study, possibly due to the younger age (16-40 years) of those investigated. The incidence of UI has been previously found to be as high as 82% and 92% in women with NE [20, 22] . Considering that UI is a more pronounced symptom in the female general population, the much lower overall UI rate in male patients with NE could be due to the gender difference [23, 24] . It is worth mention that the existing results were not consistent in respect to patients' symptoms as predictors of the presence of NE [4, 20, 22, 25] . Although Campbell et al. [25] indicated that the symptoms of overactive bladder, UI and nocturia were independent predictors in women, and the improvement of NE was associated with the alleviation of UI by transvaginal tape procedures, other studies failed to show a significant correlation regarding SUI symptoms in women [20, 25] . Unlike previous studies, we found that the presence of SUI and mixed UI symptoms, both frequency and SUI sub-scores, but not urgency and UUI sub-scores and nocturia episodes, were significantly associated with NE episodes in the univariate analysis; however, only the SUI QoL sub-scores met the criteria as an independently predictive factor during multivariate analysis. It is worth mentioning that all patients who reported SUI had secondary NE, either due to neurogenic disorders or prostate surgery. As alluded to above, the divergence among studies could be attributed to different inclusion criteria and symptom assessment approaches.",

            "text": "Bladder diaries have been authenticated as a valuable tool in the clinical evaluation of LUTS, especially in patients with nocturia, and allow nocturia to be separated into four categories, namely due to, 24-h polyuria, NP, reduced NBC and both NP plus reduced NBC, based on the calculation formulas from the diaries [13, 15, 26] . As yet, few publications have looked into these parameters in detail in adult patients with NE. Hofmeester et al. [27] suggested that amongst patients with NE aged 11-42 years, 42% and 96% had small maximum voided volume and NP, respectively. In addition to previous knowledge, our present study has shown that men with NE can possess both or either increased urine production and bladder function problems, with reduced NBC, and NP with reduced NBC, to be independent predictors of NE episodes. We might also infer that the presence of reduced NBC, as shown by bladder diaries, implies that the patients may experience fewer NE episodes, but increased nocturia episodes. However, on the contrary, The uroflowmetry studies showed that, over half of the men had a normal Q max and <30% presented a PVR of >100 mL. This seems to be widely divergent with the published data, in which the average Q max and PVR was 8.5 mL/s and 350 mL, respectively [28] . The discrepancy could be explained by the enrolment of patients with more severe LUTS with proven obstruction in the previous study, as evidenced by a high proportion of vesicoureteral reflux, bladder diverticulum and reduced compliance [28] . During VUDS, DO was found in more than one-third of the patients, in agreement with one of the previous studies (32%), but significantly lower compared with other reports (56-93%), which included a substantial number of female patients [20, 29, 30] . It should be noted that, although existing studies substantiated that DO is more common in women with secondary NE compared to the control population, we did not find that the presence of DO was not an independent predictor of NE episodes in male patients with NE [20] . Instead, BOO, caused by an enlarged prostate, was the only significant urodynamic parameter associated with the frequency of NE episodes, echoing with the previous outcomes that BOO may herald adult onset NE, which can be resolved by TURP [28] .",

Nevertheless, our present study is the largest non-retrospective and nonepidemiological study of male patients with NE. Our present study provides insight into the clinical features and predictive features of NE, especially data from bladder diaries, the use of which has been previously neglected. Additionally, there is a lack of continued medical records for those who may have had abnormal childhood bladder function and their NE status, which has been previously found to be associated with adolescence or adult onset NE and LUTS [31, 32] . Likewise, we could not trace the information on other potential aetiologies, such as psychological disorders, genetic and hereditary aspects.",

Of considerable importance, we have also shown that there are independent predictive factors of NE severity: BMI, the onset of neurogenic disease (especially, cerebral infarction, neurodegenerative diseases and encephalitis), ICIQ-MLUTS SUI QoL and nocturnal bedwetting sub-scores, the presence of reduced NBC and combination of NP plus reduce NBC, and BOO. Bladder diaries and VUDS, provide valuable information on the pathophysiological mechanisms causing NE, and should be considered during the assessment of men with NE, so that focussed treatment can be delivered.",

It is worth mentioning that in patients with fewer NE episodes (<4/week): the BMI was significantly lower; there were fewer comorbidities; and higher frequency, worse urgency QoL, and lower bedwetting sub-scores. From the ICIQ-BD data, those patients were as prone to have significantly smaller maximum voided volume, and a higher proportion of pure reduced NBC, which was consistent with the ICIQ-MLUTS recorded symptoms. For those with more severe NE (\u22654/week), compared to patients with mild symptoms, significantly increased SUI sub-score; and higher percentages of NP and combined NP plus reduced NBC were found.Univariate linear regression indicated several significant predictors for NE episodes, including: BMI; high number of comorbidities; neurogenic NE; the existence of SUI and mixed UI symptoms; high frequency, SUI and nocturnal bedwetting sub-scores; increased PVR, maximum voided volume, 24-h and nocturnal urine volume; and the presence of 24-h polyuria, NP, and combined NP plus reduced NBC.
