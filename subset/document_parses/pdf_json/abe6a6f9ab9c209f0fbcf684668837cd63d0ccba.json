Though several deep learning approaches were developed to assist in CT analysis, nobody considered study triage directly as a computer science problem. We describe two basic setups: Identification of COVID-19 to prioritize studies of potentially infected patients to isolate them as early as possible; Severity quantification to highlight studies of severe patients and direct them to a hospital or provide emergency medical care. We formalize these tasks as binary classification and estimation of affected lung percentage. Though similar problems were well-studied separately, we show that existing methods provide reasonable quality only for one of these setups. To consolidate both triage approaches, we employ a multitask learning and propose a convolutional neural network to combine all available labels within a single model. We train our model on approximately 2000 publicly available CT studies and test it with a carefully designed set consisting of 33 COVID patients, 32 healthy patients, and 36 patients with other lung pathologies to emulate a typical patient flow in an out-patient hospital. The developed model achieved 0.951 ROC AUC for Identification of COVID-19 and 0.98 Spearman Correlation for Severity quantification.

In both cases, researchers usually calculate a continuous index of COVID-19 presence or severity (depending on their task). An overview of the existed indices can be found in Tab. 1.

Researchers usually treat this problem as binary classification, e.g. COVID-19 versus all other studies. Likely, the most direct way to classify CT images with varying slice thicknesses is to train well established 2D convolutional neural networks. For example, authors of Jin et al. (2020b) trained ResNet-50 He et al. (2016a) to classify images using the obtained lung mask. An interesting and interpretable way to aggregate slice predictions into whole-study predictions was proposed in Gozes et al. (2020a) , where the number of affected slices was used as the final output of the model. Also, this work employed Grad-cam Selvaraju et al. (2017) to visualize network attention. A custom slice-level prediction aggregation was proposed in Jin et al. (2020a) to filter out false positives. The need for a post-training aggregation of slice prediction can be avoided by using 3D convolutional networks, Han et al. (2020) ; . proposed a two-headed architecture based on 3D-ResNet. This approach is a way to obtain hierarchical classification as the first head was trained to classify CTs with and without pneumonia. In contrast, the second one aimed to distinguish COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia. Alternatively, slice aggregation may be inserted into network architectures to obtain an endto-end pipeline, as was proposed in Li et al. (2020a) ; Bai et al. (2020) . Within this setup, all slices are processed by a 2D backbone (ResNet50 for Li et al. (2020a) , EfficientNet Tan and Le (2019) for Bai et al.
