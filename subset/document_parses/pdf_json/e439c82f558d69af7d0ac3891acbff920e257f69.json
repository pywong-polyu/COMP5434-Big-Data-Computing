The RV was previously overshadowed by the left ventricle (LV), whose simpler anatomy conforms better to geometric models and is more accessible to non-invasive imaging. Furthermore, early experiments falsely suggested that the RV did not contribute significantly to the generation of cardiac output [1] . However, a series of investigations over the past 25 years have provided greater insight into the RV's distinct anatomy, its performance under normal physiological conditions, and its adaptations to specific disease states. Advanced imaging, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), has provided critical assistance in the study of the RV, allowing for non-invasive characterization of the RV's response to stressors, as well as a tool for measuring the success of therapies. As a result, a detailed understanding now exists of the role of the RV in ischemic heart disease, congenital heart disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic left-sided HF. Most importantly, studies have shown that RV failure is a crucial prognostic factor in all of these disease states. In particular, the importance of RV function in left-sided HF may outweigh the importance of LV function in terms of both morbidity and mortality.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 478, "end": 481, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The RV can be divided into three anatomical units: the inlet from the right atrium (including the tricuspid, the apex, and the outflow tract (infundibulum). The apex contains prominent trabeculations, in contrast to the smooth, muscular infundibulum. Viewed in cross-section, the RV resembles a crescent that lies over the anterior aspect of the LV. The free wall is thin and the overall mass of the RV is a fraction of the LV mass, despite a larger volume. The deep muscle fibers of the RV have a longitudinal orientation, resulting in a primarily vertical direction of contractile forces. The superficial muscle fibers of the RV are oriented in a more concentric direction and are intertwined with the superficial muscle fibers of the LV. This anatomical interaction between the muscular fibers of the two chambers is also present in the interventricular septum, which is typically displaced into the RV throughout the cardiac cycle. Direct muscular continuity between the LV and RV plays a significant role in ventricular interdependence, which will be discussed in further detail below.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Anatomy and Physiology of the Right Ventricle"}, {"text": "RV contraction proceeds sequentially, initiating in the inlet, continuing through the apex and concluding in the infundibulum. The longitudinal fibers draw the apex towards the tricuspid valve, while the free wall also moves inward toward the septum. Traction on the free wall is applied by LV contraction at attachment points in the superficial muscle layer. The RV is coupled with the high compliance of the pulmonary vasculature, leading to a pressure-volume relationship that is distinct from the relationship seen in the LV. Whereas the LV continues to generate pressure until the closure of the aortic valve, RV pressure falls prior to the closure of the pulmonic valve. Ejection continues however due to the low resistance within the pulmonary circuit ( Fig. 4.1 ) [2] . The RV takes advantage of this physiology by producing an identical cardiac output to the LV with markedly reduced work and myocardial oxygen demand. However, one consequence of this interaction is the RV's heightened sensitivity to afterload, which can be deleterious in acute pressure overload states.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 772, "end": 775, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 761, "end": 769, "text": "Fig. 4.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Anatomy and Physiology of the Right Ventricle"}, {"text": "Ventricular interdependence occurs in both systole and diastole.

Diastolic interdependence is a result of the common pericardial sac. The pericardium is unable to stretch acutely in response to ventricular dilatation, and is limited in its ability to accommodate chronic ventricular dilatation. Therefore, a volume load in either chamber will cause displacement of the septum into the other chamber, resulting in a decreased diastolic volume and an impairment of ventricular output ( Fig. 4 .2) [3] . As the RV is the more compliant chamber, this diastolic interaction most commonly occurs in volume overload states of the RV, such as an atrial septal defect.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 591, "end": 594, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1078, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1064, "end": 1070, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Anatomy and Physiology of the Right Ventricle"}, {"text": "RV pathophysiology can be broadly categorized by the mechanism of the insult and its rapidity of onset. Acute events, such as a pulmonary embolism, lead to maladaptive compensatory responses, and quickly progress to RV failure. Chronic disease processes, such as congenital heart defects, often present a gradual stress on the RV, allowing it to develop adaptive mechanisms to preserve cardiac output for a prolonged period of time prior to decompensation. Conditions characterized by volume overload are generally well tolerated by the RV due to its compliant nature. On the other hand, the RV has difficulty adapting to pressure overload due to its afterloadsensitivity ( Fig. 4. 3) [4] . Interestingly, the timing of onset of pressure overload is a crucial determinant of the RV response. In Eisenmenger syndrome, the RV is able to remain compensated much longer than in adult patients with acquired pulmonary hypertension (PH). This finding has been attributed to the preservation of the fetal phenotype, which is accustomed to systemic levels of vascular resistance [5] . Intrinsic myocardial diseases, such as various forms of nonischemic cardiomyopathies, may impair RV contractility, but rarely affect the RV in isolation.

Vasoconstriction may be further exacerbated by hypoxemia. The rapid rise in afterload increases RV wall tension, which quickly leads to RV dilatation and RV systolic dysfunction. As the RV pressure rises acutely, the interventricular septum shifts into the LV, reducing LV preload and further compromising cardiac output. Finally, coronary perfusion is impaired by both the compression of the right coronary artery by elevated RV wall stress and the reduction in cardiac output. In the setting of the increased myocardial oxygen demand in the failing RV, the reduction in coronary blood flow leads to a significant supplydemand imbalance.

The immediate result of an RVI is RV free wall dyskinesis due to ischemia, although this alone may not be sufficient to produce clinical RV failure. Secondary effects include stiffening of the myocardium and dilation of the RV. Similar to the consequences of an acute PE, the acute pressure changes within the RV, in this case provoked by diastolic dysfunction, cause septal shifting and impaired LV-RV interaction. In addition septal ischemia further compromises LV performance, and diminishes the LV's ability to compensate for RV dysfunction [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 708, "end": 711, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ischemia"}, {"text": "PH is the end-product of many cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases and is the most common cause of a chronic pressure overload on the RV.

Myocyte hypertrophy and the expansion of the extracellular matrix result in increased chamber thickness. At the same time, the RV remodels into a more spherical shape with a smaller radius [8] . Through the application of LaPlace's law, which states that wall stress is proportional to chamber radius and inversely proportional to chamber thickness, it is evident that the primary result of these initial adaptations is to reduce wall stress, countering the effect of the rise in afterload.

States of chronic volume overload, such as an atrial septal defect, can persist for decades prior to the development of RV dysfunction. Two consequences of persistent RV dilatation are distortion of the tricuspid annulus and septal shift. The dilated tricuspid annulus permits tricuspid regurgitation, which can further exacerbate the volume load on the RV. Septal shift occurs when the pericardium is unable to distend any further to accommodate the dilation of the RV. As noted above, septal shift can subsequently impair LV filling and adversely affect LV performance. Finally, prolonged volume overload may cause PA pressures to rise due to increased flow through the pulmonary circuit. The development of PH is often the trigger for The natural history of persistent pulmonary hypertension. As pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) climb, cardiac output (CO) is initially maintained, but eventually begins to fall. When CO falls sufficiently to cause advanced RV failure, PAP fells as well due to insufficient pressure generation by the weak RV.

The typical clinical presentation is ventricular arrhythmias, with symptoms of RV failure affecting less than 10 % of ARVC patients [11] . In most patients, RV dysfunction can be present for decades without significant symptomatology. A similar observation has been made in animal experiments, in which an isolated reduction in RV contractility does not impair cardiac output in the setting of a normal PVR. In these animals, central filling pressures rise to permit sufficient flow through the pulmonary circuit. However, when PVR is raised, there is rapid cardiac decompensation, suggesting that the progression of RV dysfunction to RV failure may require the presence of an additional stressor, such as PH [12] .

Hepatic function and renal function are often compromised, and should be followed regularly in a patient with RV failure. Imaging studies play a crucial role in the initial assessment and serial monitoring of RV function. Echocardiography is the most frequently used imaging modality for RV assessment due to its ease of use, low cost and accessibility. However, CMRI has become the gold standard for evaluation of the RV because of its ability to overcome some of the anatomic limitations of twodimensional (2D) echocardiography.

Qualitatively comparing RV size to LV size in the apical view can provide a reasonable assessment of RV dilatation. Additional anatomic information that can be easily obtained is the appearance of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, and the presence of valvular stenosis or regurgitation. Doppler evaluation of the tricuspid regurgitant jet allows the estimation of the systolic pulmonary artery pressure through the use of the modified Bernoulli equation. Important information is also provided by the appearance of the interventricular septum in the short-axis views. Pressure overload states cause flattening of the septum, particularly during systole, which volume overload states cause flattening during diastole (Fig. 4.5 ).

RV fractional area change (RVFAC) measures the change in area of the RV between diastole and systole from the apical 4-chamber view. The tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) measures the vertical motion of the tricuspid valve annulus, with a value of less than 1.6 cm indicating RV dysfunction.

When the PCWP is elevated, but the TPG is less than 10-12 mmHg, PH is termed \"passive\" or \"post-capillary\", indicating that the elevation in PA pressures can be solely attributed to the elevated left-sided filling pressures. When the TPG is greater than 15 mmHg, the PH is termed \"mixed\" indicating that there is both a pre-capillary and post-capillary component of the PH. This may be secondary to vasoconstriction and pulmonary arterial remodeling as a response to chronically increased pulmonary venous pres- sures. Mixed PH can be further stratified into \"reactive\" and \"nonreactive\" forms through administration of a vasodilator, such as sodium nitroprusside or milrinone, to reduce the PCWP. In non-reactive PH, the TPG will remain elevated despite a lower PCWP, whereas patients with reactive PH will have concurrent decreases in the PCWP and TPG. The presence of reactive PH may indicate a more favorable prognosis, particularly when considering a patient for advanced therapies such as cardiac transplantation [17] .

Patients with RVI are often described as \"volume-sensitive\", and may require higher preloads to maintain cardiac output.

If mechanical ventilation is required, tidal volumes should be minimized to prevent further augmentation of PA pressures. Pulmonary vasodilators relax pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, lowering PA pressures and PVR. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has the advantages of pulmonary selectivity, avoiding the hypotension associated with systemic vasodilators. It is also only active in ventilated areas of the lung, reducing the potential for V/Q mismatching. iNO is most commonly used in acute RV failure due to difficulty in administration to non-ventilated patients. Short-term hemodynamic improvements have been demonstrated with the use of iNO in the treatment of RVI [45] and in a study of intensive care patients with mixed causes of RV failure [46] , but outcomes data are limited.

Outside of this subset, most PAH patients will be started on oral therapy with an ERA or PDE-5I.
