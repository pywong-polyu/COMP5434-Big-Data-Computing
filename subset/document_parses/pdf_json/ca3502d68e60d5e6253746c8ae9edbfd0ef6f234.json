The aim of this study was to determine how closely a blinded lung ultrasound (US) score correlates with the degree of ALI, as quantified clinically and histologically, in a neonatal animal model. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicates the systemic inflammatory response of sepsis, including many viral infections. It is characterized by uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokine activation, diffuse epithelia and endothelial injury-causing permeability edema, hypoxemia, and poorly compliant lungs 2 ; and is notoriously difficult to model, due to animal instability and high mortality. 3 ALI induced by oleic acid (OA) in pigs is a stable, reproducible model 4 that recreates the early, direct endothelial injury and pulmonary edema phase of ARDS, 1 minute postinjection. 5 We have used this model extensively to examine mechanical ventilation modes, potential treatment modalities, [6] [7] [8] and to assess recruitment with computed tomography (CT) imaging 9 in juvenile and adult pigs, but neonatal parallels are lacking.",

Clinical manifestations include decreased lung compliance, heterogeneous atelectasis, intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and hypoxemia. 10 Diagnostic criteria include the bilateral presence of diffuse, irregular pulmonary opacities, or infiltrates, as well as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and (preductally measured) oxygenation deficit. 10 Typically this diagnosis requires chest radiography; the substitution of lung US has been robustly debated. 11, 12 While POCUS is used to semi-quantitatively follow lung aeration, 13 it is not yet recommended for evaluation of ARDS severity in neonates, 1 due to limited concordance between chest radiography and lung US.

On the other hand, loss of dynamic compliance (ratio of compliance of the upper 20% of the P/V curve to total compliance, or C20/C < 0.8) can reflect overdistension of the lung. 24 C20/C trended downward but was not significantly decreased in OA-treated groups, indicating that any changes we observed in cardiac output or pulmonary vascular mechanics could not be ascribed to pulmonary overinflation. 25 The time constant (TC), the time required for the lung unit to fill or empty was unchanged in OA-treated groups suggesting the applied PEEP was adequate to mitigate end-expiratory resistance. 26 Blood gases were more rapidly altered in severe injury animals, the falling pH reflecting impaired perfusion without a significant change in respiratory acidosis. PaO 2 decreased immediately after OA treatment in both moderate and severe injuries. Oxygen saturation was initially maintained in the moderate injury group but fell by the end of the study. This discrepancy between PaO 2 and SaO 2 may be explained by the less severe impairment in calculated V:Q matching in the moderate injury group. The hypoxemia that characterizes ARDS is ascribed primarily to intrapulmonary shunting, with V:Q matching preserved until a severe injury, when perfusion of low V:Q regions contributes to hypoxemia. 29 Intrapulmonary shunt fraction was significantly increased in both OA-treated groups. Intrapulmonary shunt, A-a difference, mean airway pressure and PaO 2 (but not SaO 2 ) have been shown to correlate linearly with the severity of lung edema in ALI. 30 Lung US has been proposed as a valid alternative to chest radiography or CT to diagnose ARDS in the adult population 31 ; but the pediatric and neonatal experience is limited. 13 In OA injury models, vertical hyperechoic B-lines correlating with increasing extravascular lung water are detectable starting 15 minutes after OA injury, coincident with the fall in static pulmonary compliance but before onset of functional impairments such as hypoxemia or decreased P/F ratio. 32 A semi-quantitative 6-region lung US scoring index was originally developed in septic adults for early identification of pulmonary edema 33 ;",

Cumulative lung US scores (combined anterior and posterior scores) showed a dose-dependent worsening of OA lung injury over time (Figure 5C). From histology, mechanical ventilation alone for the duration of the experiment did not create significant lung injury in controls.

We observed marked decreases in cardiac left and right ventricular outputs, with much diminished diastolic filling consistent with loss of intravascular volume. Measured CVP was unchanged, a less sensitive indicator if circuit pressure is maintained evident from the associated increase in calculated SVR. SVR elevation following OA injury has been reported previously, presumably reflecting reflex adrenergic activation.27 Increased pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance are well documented with OA administration in older porcine models whose size permits direct placement of a pulmonary arterial catheter. In the neonatal OA model, echocardiographic eccentricity indices and PAAT:ejection time ratio (PAAT:ET; a flowsensitive indicator of pulmonary vascular resistance) served as alternatives. These indices were unchanged due to profound right ventricular dysfunction manifested by decreased TAPSE. Attenuated PAAT:ET in RV failure with decreased TAPSE has been reported in models of pulmonary hypertension.28 As such, we are unable to comment specifically upon pulmonary vascular hemodynamics in this from a single posterolateral zone per lung.

In ARDS, earliest US abnormalities appear in posterior regions, with a most rapid filling of dependent alveoli 36 ; our data confirm this, and we propose that once lung edema is detected in dependent areas in early ARDS, anterior views may be more useful for tracking progression and grading ARDS severity while in the supine position. This corroborates findings in adult patients with ARDS,37 and also in coronavirus disease-2019related ARDS.38 X-ray has been presumed superior to the US in the diagnosis of ARDS due to deeper posterior penetration of the former in a predominantly posterior disease.36 Although we were unable to compare the US to chest X-rays in this study, the finding that the easily-accessed anterior lung US zones reveal early ARDS progression may call this assumption into question.Postmortem removal of the lungs after 3 hours of mechanical ventilation revealed that control lungs appeared grossly normal with only mild basal erythema; lungs of both moderate and severe groups appeared engorged, ruddy, and hemorrhagic. Histologic quantification of lung injury in anterior and posterior lung tissue was similar for moderate and severe groups; however, in each discrete category of grading, 17 severely injured lungs were qualitatively at the upper end of the range with greater membrane thickening, more visible alveolar debris and more neutrophilic infiltration than moderately injured lung. Comparisons of composite lung US score in stabilized lung injury with histopathologic score (both measured in right lung) indicate a moderate degree of correlation between in vivo US observation and the gold standard for degree of tissue injury. A recent study of OA-induced ALI in adult rabbits compared the US obtained ex vivo with tissue histology, finding the frequency of postmortem B-line artifact corre-",
