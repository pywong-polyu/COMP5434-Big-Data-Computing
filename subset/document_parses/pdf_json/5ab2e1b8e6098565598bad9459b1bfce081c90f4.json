Flying foxes are the wildlife reservoir from which the virus was first isolated in 1996. Following a heat stress mortality event in Australian flying foxes in 2013, a novel HeV variant was discovered. This study describes the subsequent surveillance of Australian flying foxes for this novel virus over a nine year period using qRT-PCR testing of tissues from flying foxes submitted primarily for Australian bat lyssavirus diagnosis. Genome sequencing and characterisation of the novel HeV variant was also undertaken.",

Ten of the positive samples were from grey-headed flying foxes (GHFF, Pteropus poliocephalus), however this species was over-represented in the opportunistic sampling (83% of bats tested were GHFF). The positive GHFF samples were collected from Victoria and South Australia and one positive Little red flying fox (LRFF, Pteropus scapulatus) was collected from Western Australia. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of henipavirus antigen, associated with an inflammatory lesion in cardiac blood vessels of one GHFF. Positive samples were sequenced and the complete genome was obtained from three samples. When compared to published HeV genomes, there was 84% sequence identity at the nucleotide level. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the newly detected HeV belongs to the HeV species but occupies a distinct lineage. We have therefore designated this virus HeV genotype 2 (HeV-g2). Attempts to isolate virus from PCR positive samples have not been successful.",

Virus was also recovered from pooled foetal liver and lung from the same flying fox, and from neonatal lung of a black flying fox (BFF, Pteropus alecto), all collected in Brisbane in September 1996. Since 1996 there have been numerous surveillance studies, most utilising a method of collecting urine underneath flying fox camps and testing by real-time PCR. Most positive results have had high cycle threshold (Ct) values (30+) suggesting low viral loads [10] . Virus isolation attempts from flying foxes are rarely successful and remain a challenge [11] . Sero-surveys of flying foxes have been employed to determine infection prevalence but require the capture and restraint of bats for serum collection, which is a labour-intensive activity with ethical implications. To address these limitations, we have undertaken passive surveillance for the molecular detection of HeV in flying fox specimens submitted to our laboratory for the primary purpose of ABLV testing.",

The amino acid sequences of six individual proteins are highly homologous to those of HeV (AF017149), with sequence identities of 96% for N protein, 82% for P protein, 96% M protein, 95% F protein, 92% for G protein, and 95% for L protein. Comparison of nucleotide and protein sequences of each of the six individual genes is demonstrated in Table 6 . In addition, there are minor sequence variations among the novel bat HeV genomes from this study, though they share over 99% nucleotide identity at genome level. HeV-g2/2020-01 and -03 are nearly identical with only 5nt differences and one aa change. HeV-g2/2020-02 is slightly diverse from the other two, with 75 nt changes across the genome, and 13 aa changes in different coding regions ( Table 7) . Analysis of partial genome sequences from HeV-g2/2013-01 from South Australia revealed minor variations in comparison with the 3 viruses from Victoria (data not shown).",

Based on the ICTV species demarcation criteria, a new species in the genus Henipavirus is defined as having a distance greater than 0.03 between the tip of the branch and the nearest node to the reference sequence (GenBank Accession No. AAC83194.3) in a phylogenetic tree of the complete L protein [1] . Phylogenetic analysis of the complete L protein of the novel HeV detected in this study indicate that these viruses are HeV species (branch length to the nearest node is < 0.03). As these viruses form a distinct sub-lineage, we propose to designate this group as HeV genotype 2 (HeV-g2), and designate the previously identified sub-lineage, containing the reference HeV sequence, as genotype 1 (HeV-g1) . Therefore, the strain names of the 3 viruses with full genome from 2020, and one virus with partial genome from 2013 are: HeV-g2/Australia/Pteropus poliocephalus/2020-01, HeV-g2/Australia/Pteropus poliocephalus /2020-02, HeV-g2/Australia/Pteropus poliocephalus /2020-03, and HeV-g2/Australia/Pteropus poliocephalus /2013-01.",

Sequence variation was observed within HeV-g2 despite high sequence similarity (> 99% at genome level) between each other. This is similar to the findings from HeV (g1) in flying foxes and horses [22, 23] . The high level of genetic similarity between HeV-g1 and HeV-g2 indicates that the latter shares the pathogenic phenotype of the prototype HeV-g1 and can also be considered as a zoonotic pathogen. To date, there has been no report of spill-over events of HeV-g2 in the areas where the virus has been detected in flying foxes. However, the recent retrospective identification of a virus belonging to this sub-lineage from a 2015 case of equine neurological disease in Queensland shows the HeV-g2 is able to infect horses and potentially cause disease [24] . Further studies on epidemiology and pathogenicity of HeV-g2 are warranted.",

Although serological evidence of HeV infection has been found in all four flying fox species in Australia, including the SFF, BFF, LRFF and GHFF [27], the discovery of HeV-g2 raises the question of which variant the flying foxes have been exposed to-HeV-g1, HeV-g2 and/or other variants.

Neither GHFF nor LRFF have been identified as the principal source of HeV in spillover events to horses, despite reports of high levels of seroprevalence to HeV in these species, and the isolation of virus from GHFF [9, 31, 32] .

Virus co-infection in flying foxes has not been studied extensively but is known to occur. While mean viral prevalence was low, multi-viral shedding from flying fox populations was common in one report, with up to eight paramyxoviruses, which included HeV-g1, detected in pooled urine samples from one mixed colony (containing BFF and GHFF) at a single point in time, and referred to as a 'synchronous shedding pulse' [33] .",

This demonstrates the benefit of using diagnostic qRT-PCR tests that target multiple genes for disease investigations to address circulating genetic variants. Subsequently, a new qRT-PCR assay based on the HeV-g2 M gene was developed and applied to the screening of samples from flying foxes. This assay is more sensitive than the HeV N gene assay for detection of HeV-g2, and it is also able to detect HeV belonging to the prototype lineage. The broad reactivity of this assay could potentially be beneficial to the detection of mutant/variant forms of HeV in the future. Through obtaining more sequences of HeV-g2 from GHFFs during this study, we developed an additional HeV-g2 specific qRT-PCR assay targeting the N gene. This assay is specific for HeV-g2 and is used as the confirmatory test in our laboratory. Preliminary validation of both assays using bat samples submitted for disease exclusion, equine samples from previous outbreaks and NiV isolates indicated that these tests perform with high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Further assessment of these tests will be required for full validation according to World Organisation for Animal Health principles for veterinary diagnostic tests [34] .",

Previously, HeV has been isolated from flying fox urine using these cell cultures, with equal success in either Vero cells or primary bat cell lines [23] . The unsuccessful attempts for isolation of HeV-g2 virus may be due to non-viability of the virus in the samples due to poor sample quality. These samples were collected either from carcasses exposed to ambient temperature for unknown periods, or euthanised and stored under suboptimal conditions for the preservation of live virus. The low virus load in most of the samples, as indicated by qRT-PCR results, may have also been a contributing factor.",

The new variant causes vasculitis in the flying fox host and it is has been associated with a fatal illness in a horse. Due to high levels of genome similarity with the HeV prototype lineage, HeV-g2 can be considered a zoonotic pathogen, posing a significant risk to different species of animals, particularly horses and humans. Further in-depth studies on the epidemiology, pathogenicity, and risk of spillover of this new virus are warranted. Development of the new RT-qPCR assays reported in this study will significantly improve the detection, diagnosis and surveillance of HeV-g2 in flying foxes and other host species.",
