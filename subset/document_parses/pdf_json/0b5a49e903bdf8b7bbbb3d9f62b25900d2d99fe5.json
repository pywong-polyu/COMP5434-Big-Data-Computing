Cytopathy appeared only in cell cultures of BALF. BALF yielded a higher bacterial load than sputum or blood, and may be the most suitable clinical specimen for the genomic diagnosis of severe pneumonia.",

Clinical progression and mortality may be related to delays in diagnosis and treatment [4] . However, early diagnosis is confounded by nonspecific clinical presentations; low levels of clinical suspicion of an uncommon infection, and limited availability of diagnostic assays in most clinical laboratories [10, 11] . Cultures of C. psittaci are hazardous, timeconsuming and require enhanced biosafety measures and expertise; serologic assays require acute and convalescent samples, and are thereby yield untimely results; and specific PCR has disadvantage that high sensitivity may depend on samples collected from the clinical phase [11] .",

Past medical history was notable for chronic hepatitis B infection, but was negative for nicotine, alcohol or drug abuse; unusual environmental or zoonotic exposures; or antecedent illnesses among family members. On the first hospital day, computerized tomography (CT) of the chest disclosed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with dense consolidation of the right lung, polyglandular mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and partial tracheobronchial stenosis in both lungs (Fig. 1) . Additional findings included a leukocyte count of 15.12 \u00d7 10 9 /L (reference range: 3.5-9.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L) with 95.9 % neutrophils (40-75 %), platelet count 47 \u00d7 10 9 /L (100-300 \u00d7 10 9 /L); and C-reactive protein 564 mg/L (0-8 mg/L). Antibiotic therapy was initiated with moxifloxacin, tigecycline, and imipenem. On the second hospital day, the patient underwent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation indicated for respiratory failure. The antibiotic regimen was revised to moxifloxacin plus tigecycline after C. psittaci was identified on the second hospital day. However, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and she died on the fourth hospital day.",
