            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health crisis with very high morbidity and mortality rates in a short time. Activation of innate and adaptive immune responses by coronavirus infection causes an uncontrolled inflammatory response resulting in a cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients. 1 Crosstalk between immune cells and endothelial cells during coronavirus infection impacts the activation of several inflammatory cascades, causing hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytokine storms have been shown to cause manifestations of acute respiratory distress syndrome and thromboembolism leading to vascular occlusions, such as in cases of acute ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, vasculitis and sudden death. 2, 3 Significantly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines suggest a poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Research shows that patients with severe COVID-19 tend to have higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as Tumour Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) than those with mild or moderate illness. 4, 5 This phenomenon shows a very close relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, predicting the survival of COVID-19 patients using the three pro-inflammatory cytokines will allow clinicians to take prompt and appropriate treatment to prevent the severity of COVID-19 from reducing mortality.",

Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNFa, IL-2, IL-4, IP-10 and MCP-1 are associated with an increased risk of mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Huang (2020) research stated that COVID-19 patients treated in the ICU had higher IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 than patients not admitted to the ICU. 6 Meanwhile, a prospective cohort study in 24 COVID-19 patients revealed that levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, FGF, IP-10, MCP-1, and TNF correlated with 30-day mortality. 7 In addition, Chen et al found that the levels of IP-10, MCP-1, and IL-6 were significantly higher in COVID-19 critically Ill patients. 8 MCP-1 and IL-10 were not significantly associated with mortality but were associated with high levels of d-dimer associated with mortality.",

            "text": "Many studies have reported that acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the leading causes of death related to COVID-19. ARDS is triggered by a cytokine storm that directly damages the respiratory epithelium, liver, heart, and kidneys, including TNF-\u03b1. 9 The soluble form of TNF-\u03b1 and the membrane protein form are active forms with different affinities for the TNF receptor. When it binds to the TNF receptor, TNF-will cause a pleiotropic effect or stimulate the secretion of other systemic cytokines, so TNF-\u03b1 is known as an early-phase cytokine. 10, 11 Interleukin 1\u03b2 is released by macrophages via inflammasomes and contributes to the cytokine storm as the most aggressive response to COVID-19. 12 IL-1\u03b2 is known to play a role in immunological dysregulation in severe patients with respiratory failure, 13 which in cytokine storm of ARDS correlates with disease severity, also may be associated with organ failure. 14, 15 Yang et al (2020) found that increased IL-1 receptor antagonist as a marker of increased viral load and risk of death in 14 severe COVID-19 patients. 16 Therefore, IL-1\u03b2 is part of the cytokine storm generated by coronavirus infection. 17 IL-1 functions after binding to the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) and is known to transduce and activate one of the well-known inflammatory pathways, the NFkB pathway. 18 MCP-1 is a potent monocyte chemotactic factor constitutively produced or induced by oxidative stress, cytokines, or growth factors. 19 MCP-1 was associated with high levels of d-dimer associated with death. 8 Furthermore, it has been reported that MCP-1 expression increases rapidly in the early phase of acute infection and then progressively decreases with disease progression. 20 IL-1\u03b2, and MCP-1 are pro-inflammatory cytokines critical in the defence response against systemic infection and injury. 17,21 IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1 respond as an emergent cytokine by initiating acute-phase protein synthesis. In addition to TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) are early phase cytokines often encountered when the body is exposed to coronavirus. 4, 21 Although there have been studies using similar cytokines to predict the survival of COVID-19 patients in various countries, there has been no reporting in Indonesia in the period of Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2. So, this study wants to confirm the research results on the survival of COVID-19 patients in Indonesia with various other countries.",

Thus, pro-inflammatory factors play a central role in the severity of COVID-19, especially in patients with co-morbidities. 24, 25 An overactive and untreated immune response can be lethal in these situations, suggesting that death in COVID-19 cases is likely due to this virus-driven hyper inflammation. 26 TNF-\u03b1 is one of the cytokines that promote inflammation, including during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 41 patients suffering from COVID-19, 13 were admitted to the ICU due to severe COVID-19. The patients treated in the ICU had higher IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP-1, MIP1A, and TNF than non-ICU patients. 27 According to a cohort study conducted by Del Valle et al, 1484 COVID-19 patients were followed up to 41 days after admission with a median of 8 days. 23 They found that high serum levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 at the time of hospitalisation were strong and independent predictors of patient survival. In addition, the investigators obtained a cut-off of 35 ng/L, where values above the cut-off value had a high mortality rate. 28 We followed the patient's condition for up to 28 days so that we got the patient outcomes in the form of survivors and non-survivors. TNF-\u03b1 was calculated on the first day the patient was admitted. The optimal cut-off value of TNF-\u03b1 obtained statistically was 37.88 ng/L. This cut-off value becomes a reference for calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and relative risk in the TNF-\u03b1 examination. In this study, the median TNF-\u03b1 in In addition, TNF-\u03b1 can also be an independent predictor of severity in COVID-19 patients. 28, 29 Cytokine storm is positively correlated with disease severity. Cytokine storm conditions in COVID-19 patients have been shown to increase the severity of COVID-19 disease so that it can increase the risk of death in COVID-19. 30 However, few studies prove the relationship of IL-1\u03b2 with the death of COVID-19 patients. In this study, the mean levels of IL-1\u03b2 were higher in the non-survivor group of COVID-19 patients than in the survivor group, which is consistent with previous studies. The study by Nile et al on 27 severe COVID-19 patients analysed nine biomarkers (IL-1\u03b2, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-, CRP, Ferritin) and lymphocytes as pro-inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19. 31 This study found that pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased in patients with severe COVID-19.",
