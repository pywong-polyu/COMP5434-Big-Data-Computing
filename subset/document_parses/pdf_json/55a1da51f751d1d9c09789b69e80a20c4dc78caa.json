            "text": "Dendrimers are core-shell nanostructures with high size uniformity, low polydispersity, and a large number of functional groups at the chain ends, which can be easily tailored based on the guest (drug or ligand) molecule requirements (Tomalia 2004; Dias et al. 2019; Badalkhani-Khamseh et al. 2019) . Due to the presence of a hydrophobic interior and a hydrophilic surface layer in their structure, dendrimers enhance the solubility and consequently bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs by encapsulating them within the dendritic structure (Kesharwani et al. 2014; Chauhan et al. 2020; Badalkhani-Khamseh et al. 2017a) . Also, they allow the mixing of hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds in catalytic applications (Yamamoto et al. 2019 ) and could be of great relevance in co-delivery of hydrophobic/hydrophilic drugs for enhanced synergistic treatment. In recent decades, a number of dendritic scaffolds have been synthesized with nanosize and shape having different functionalities and Abstract The electronic sensitivity and reactivity of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) and polyester dendrimers toward favipiravir (T705) were inspected using density functional theory method. The T705 drug is adsorbed on the surface of PAMAM and polyester dendrimers with the binding energy of -27.26 and -26.80 kcal mol \u22121 , respectively, in the solvent phase. The energy gap of PAMAM and polyester dendrimers reduced by about 32% and 27%, indicating that the electrical conductance of carriers become 8.16 \u00d7 10 23 and 4.41 \u00d7 10 22 times higher, upon T705 adsorption. The work function (\u03a6) value of PAMAM and polyester is changed about 1.53 and 0.71 eV, respectively. Thus, PAMAM dendrimer is about 2.5 times stronger \u03a6-type sensor than polyester dendrimer. applications including poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM), poly(propylene imine) (PPI), triazine, and polyester dendrimers (Esfand and Tomalia 2001; Parrott et al. 2009; Lim and Simanek 2012; Feliu et al. 2012; Pedziwiatr-Werbicka et al. 2019; Parashar et al. 2019) .",

            "text": "Since their synthesis in 1985 (Tomalia et al. (1985) ), PAMAM dendrimers have been the most frequently studied dendrimers to solve the problems related to targeted drug delivery (Akhtar et al. 2019; Holmes et al. 2019; Kheiriabad et al. 2020; Badalkhani-Khamseh et al. 2017b ). However, PAMAM dendrimers are not biodegradable in vivo, which hinders their translation to clinical trials (Fischer et al. 2003; Hong et al. 2006; Winnicka et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, potentiometric titrations showed that PAMAM dendrimers carry positive charges on their peripheral groups at physiological pH (Cakara et al. 2003 ) which leads to cytotoxicity response (Mukherjee et al. 2010a, b) , but the systemic modification of surface groups (e.g., hydroxylation, acetylation, PEGylation) could resolve this problem (Jain et al. 2010; Svenson 2009; Shi et al. 2006; Kolhatkar et al. 2007) . The polyester dendrimers based on 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid (bis-MPA) monomers (Ihre et al. 1996) are biodegradable and biocompatible with very low toxicity and low immunogenicity (Feliu et al. 2012; Ihre et al. 2002) . Therefore, several biomedical applications have been proposed for polyester dendrimers in pre-clinical studies (Stenstr\u00f6m 2020) .",

The adsorption of T705 reduces the energy gap of PAMAM and polyester dendrimers considerably, but the energy gap of PAMAM-t705 and polyester-T705 is about 6 and 7 eV, respectively, meaning that the thermal energy at 300 K (~ 25 meV) is insufficient to allow electrons from the valence band to be promoted to the conduction band. It is proposed to use some energy gap enlarging methods like surface modification to reduce the energy gap of dendrimers. Adsorption process also affects the Fermi level of work function type (\u03a6-type) sensors. The \u03a6-type sensor applies a Kelvin oscillator instrument to calculate the values of \u03a6 before and after adsorption process (Hosseinian et al. 2017) . When a chemical agent is adsorbed by a \u03a6-type sensor, the gate voltage of adsorbent changes; therefore, an electrical signal is created detecting the presence of adsorbed molecule. The \u03a6 value is considered as the minimum amount of energy needed to induce electron emission from the Fermi level:",
