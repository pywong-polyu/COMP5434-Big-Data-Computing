A key problem is underdetermination: there are many competing formulations of quantum mechanics at the foundational level, so it is unclear what we should be realists about. Matthias Egg (2021) argues that scientific realism can be reconciled with quantum mechanics by articulating realist commitments in terms of \"effective\" ontology. 1 Egg argues that a realist interpretation without undue metaphysical speculation can be given of \"Textbook Quantum Mechanics\" (TQM), that is, quantum mechanics \"as it is formulated in standard textbooks.\" Egg argues that despite its \"somewhat messy and recipe-like form\" TQM can be construed as an \"effective theory\" the ontology of which is given \"in functional terms [and not by] reference to the nature of their theoretical posits.\" (p. 7, original emphasis) I will argue in general terms that Egg's conception of \"effective\" (or \"functional\") ontology is ontologically overly promiscuous. More specifically, I will argue that it is in tension with how physics deals with theoretical inconsistencies by adjudicating 1 All references to Egg are to this paper. ontological commitments in a more fine-grained manner.

(p. 3) So, on the one hand, one can articulate the ontology of QM on the basis of this or that formulation/interpretation of QM (as philosophers of physics do), but then one cannot justify a scientific realist attitude towards it due to the problem of underdetermination. On the other hand, one can avoid the underdetermination by limiting one's realist commitments to what is shared by all the alternative formulations, but then it is unclear \"whether the resulting commitments are substantive enough to constitute an interesting quantum ontology\" (p. 5) Egg argues that a substantive enough quantum ontology, one that is not threatened by underdetermination, can actually be found in TQM. The key is to acknowledge that the latter is an \"effective theory\". The distinction between between effective and fundamental theories underwrites Egg's demarcation between effective and fundamental ontology. As to the former distinction, \"what marks a theory as effective is that it successfully deals with all the phenomena within a natural domain, where 'natural' is usually spelled out in terms of a physical parameter (energy, for example) which needs to be in a certain range for the theory to be applicable.\" (Egg, 2021, p. 8) For example, Newtonian mechanics is an effective theory since it is successfully applicable in the non-quantum domain of low relative speeds and weak gravitational fields, and non-relativistic quantum mechanics is an effective theory as a low-energy limit of quantum field theory.",

In the absence of a proper solution to the measurement problem, does TQM provide us with anything over and above a mathematical formalism and some rules on how to extract empirical predictions from it? To see how it does, one needs to realize that questions about the ontology of effective theories must be answered in functional terms. They cannot be answered by any reference to the nature of their theoretical posits, insofar as that would require knowledge about how these posits emerge from a fundamental theory, which is just what the effective theory does not provide. Instead, the posits of an effective theory are characterized by what they do (effectively), rather than by what they are (fundamentally). (p. 7, original emphasis) This encapsulates Egg's account of effective ontology. He elaborates on these general remarks by giving some specific examples, advocating for instance \"realism about spin states (and their components) insofar as they are assigned to quantum systems by TQM.\" (p. 12) (I will examine the case of spin in Section 5.)",

Before I argue for this, I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that scientific realists should be (only) committed to fundamental ontology. Indeed, while the distinction between fundamental and non-fundamental ontology is important in e.g. contemporary metaphysics and philosophy of physics, it arguably has not been central to scientific realism. Looking at the scientific realist literature, one can see that most realists commit to the reality of molecules, atoms, bacteria and viruses, and other things that are obviously not fundamental (whatever that means exactly). Furthermore, arguably a realist attitude towards such non-fundamental posits should not require realism about their more fundamental 'constituents'. After all, it should be possible to find out about reality of molecules, for example, before finding out about electrons, say. Indeed, it seems that a realist epistemology of science couldn't get off the ground at all if we did not allow ontological commitment to such non-fundamental features of the world, for we have no well-confirmed scientific theories about the truly fundamental. So, from the point of view of the scientific realism debate a realist commitment to non-fundamental ontology thus seems incontrovertible, and scientific realists who equate 'real' with 'fundamental' are rare outside philosophy of physics. 2",

This does not mean that realists should agree with Egg's realist commitment to effective ontology, however. The latter saddles the realist with principles of ontological commitment -a novel meta-ontology -according to which scientific realists should indiscriminately commit to whatever theoretical posits are 'doing the work' in our best scientific theories (in the sense indicated above). This meta-ontology can be compared with other ontological frameworks that scientific realists have adopted. For example, a prominent meta-ontological stance amongst realists involves regarding theoretical posits' explanatory contributions as indicating ontologically commitment. Such explanatory contributions necessarily involve 'doing' (as opposed to just 'being') in the sense of causing or being otherwise explanatorily responsible for empirical phenomena. But, notably, realist analyses of scientific explanations' ontological commitments has nothing to do with the distinction between fundamental and non-fundamental, since good (accepted, well justified, etc.) scientific explanations can be furnished by fundamental and effective theories alike. Moreover, arguably the ontological commitments induced by explanatory indispensability are best analysed on a case-specific basis that does not lend itself to an overarching meta-ontological thesis (Saatsi, 2018) . Sometimes indispensable explanatory posits are ontologically committing, sometimes not, and a lot depends on the details: what kind of explanation is at stake, how it explains, and how the explanation in questions hangs together with the rest of science. For example, despite the various explanatorily effective roles played by idealisations, mathematics, and non-mathematical abstract objects (cf. Psillos, 2010) , it has been argued that such indispensability does not imply a realist commitment, all things considered (see, e.g., Saatsi, 2016a,b) .",

Realists have happily defended realism about atoms, molecules, viruses, and such without any qualms about their non-fundamentality. Scientists provide good evidence for them, they explain by appealing to them, and they don't regard them in tension with the more fundamental areas of science.

The latter, as we have seen, is characterised in abstract terms by reference to 'functions' and 'doings'. The problem with effective ontology is that it ends up containing more than realists should want to bargain for. Construing the indispensable theoretical posits of all effective theories realistically commits one equally to, e.g., light rays (and also rays in geophysics, etc.) given the effectiveness of geometrical optics, and Newtonian gravitational force (and Coriolis force and other 'pseudo-forces'), given the effectiveness of Newtonian physics. Such theoretical notions are indispensable to a good effective theory, but indiscriminating commitment to their reality leads to serious theoretical tensions arising from interrelations between more and less fundamental theories, and also from within a given scientific theory, as we will see.",

Where no such tension exists, no articulation or elimination is called for. I take it that no tension exists between fundamental physics and our scientific commitment to the COVID-19 virus, its mechanisms of replication and propagation, for example. Realism about the non-fundamental in and of itself has nothing to do with whether or not we deem science as having discovered that there are no light rays (despite the 'effective ontology' of geometrical optics); no Newtonian gravitational force (despite the 'effective ontology' of Newtonian theory); etc. Viruses can still be real -as real as apples. Instead of arguing for effective realism (or some other general meta-ontological view) as a part of scientific realism, our efforts are better spent on contributing to the scientific image by recognising and relieving such tensions where they exist.",

            "text": "Denying the reality of Newtonian gravitational forces does not mean that there is no gravitational force in GTR. Rather, it means that the concept of gravitational force in GTR is inconsistent with the Newtonian gravitational force. GTR must accommodate, of course, e.g., the phenomenon of a material body experiencing 'weight' against the floor of a rocket ship that is (1) accelerating, or (2) suspended (as opposed to free-falling) in an appropriate gravitational field. GTR can do that by identifying how the relevant forces depend on the appropriate coordinate system and the total mass-energy of the body (see, e.g., Ridgely, 2010) . From covariant divergence of the stress-energy-momentum tensor one can derive an expression for the 'general force' experienced by an observer in general coordinates. And from this expression one can derive forces in specific coordinate systems, such as a local co-moving coordinates of a uniformly accelerating observer, or the Schwarzschild coordinates in the case of a stationary observer in a spherically symmetric spacetime. These then yield equations that can be formally identified with Newton's second law and Newton's law of gravitation, at the appropriate limits of weak acceleration and weakly gravitating source, respectively (ibid.). The 'general force' equation similarly entails the forces experienced by observers due to rotating coordinates, corresponding to centrifugal and Coriolis forces. Critically, these derivations manifestly show how in all of these cases the force in question is on an equal ontological footing as an inertial one, to be contrasted with Newtonian gravitational force (ibid.). In the big picture, therefore, the force that Newton's gravitational theory so effectively captures cannot be conceptually equated with the Newtonian gravitational force simply on pain of contradiction: gravitational force cannot be inertial and non-inertial at the same time. 4 Could an effective realist maintain that both inertial and non-inertial gravitational force are real, one just being more fundamental than the other? Perhaps, but now this creates an unpalatable tension with how physics conceptualises 'what is real' when it comes to gravity, for physicists (at least when they are being careful and consistent) do not take gravitational force to be real as a non-inertial force (anymore than they take geometrical line light-rays or absolute simultaneity to be real). Admittedly physicists' talk abouts matters of ontology can be imprecise and impressionistic, but the relevance for physics of the conceptual distinction between inertial and noninertial forces indicates the gravity of the tension in question. The aim to coherently conceptualise gravity at all scales has nothing to do with denying the reality of viruses on the basis of their absence from 'fundamental' physics.",

'pseudo', or 'fictitious') forces within Newtonian mechanics itself. The latter forces, which include Coriolis and centrifugal forces, are always proportional to the mass involved, like gravity is, and they arise from describing the system using a non-inertial frame of reference. In many situations the most natural frame is indeed non-inertial, such as the rotating frame of the our planet for various earthly phenomena associated with the Coriolis force (e.g. weather, or Foucault's pendulum). There's no doubt about the theoretical effectiveness of noninertial forces in various contexts (see any textbook of atmospheric physics for the indispensability of Coriolis force!), and they can capture features of dynamical systems that are undeniably explanatory. Yet when it comes to ontological bookkeeping the 'fictitious' status of thus labelled inertial forces is also critical. For what counts as a 'natural' frame of reference can be highly contextual, and given that any non-inertial frame gives rise to the corresponding inertial forces, the latter can be multiplied ad infinitum simply through the choice of a coordinate system. Furthermore, it can be shown that the consistency of Newtonian dynamics requires that (real) forces are never acceleration-dependent (Pars, 1965, pp. 11-12) .",

And the key to taking TQM ontologically seriously is to construe it in 'functional' terms: \"State vectors (or wave functions) codify the behaviour that quantum systems display in virtue of their quantum states in given experimental situations.

In the case of TQM the worry is not that some future (more 'fundamental') theory could replace TQM as an effective recipe for calculating statistical measurement outcomes with undeniable accuracy and reliability. Rather, as Egg anticipates, the worry is that \"this kind of persistence of TQM can always be viewed as a purely practical matter without any ontological import,\" and that its \"mathematical precision only implies ontological precision if a clear interpretation of the mathematical apparatus is given. \" (p. 22) In response to this worry Egg's effective realist \"rejects the fundamentalist's requirements on a 'clear interpretation': as long as TQM precisely informs us about how quantum systems behave as a function of their spin state [. . . ] it yields all the ontological precision one can expect from an effective theory like QM.\" (p. 23)",

Ditto regarding the Coriolis force in theories of atmospheric circulation that inform us about wind patterns, etc. In the latter case this is because we lack the desired conceptual coherence overall, and the realist's commitments should reflect how physics in the grand scheme of things demotes the ontological status of both Newtonian gravitational and Coriolis forces.

Discreteness: \"electrons always hit the detector in one of just two possible locations.\" Uniqueness: \"the entire electron [is] found at a single location on the detector.\" He then reviews how TQM represents the Stern-Gerlach setup by mathematically representing the electron with a two-component wavefunction \u03c7( x) that evolves according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.

All this is suggestive of an effective ontology: surely something (whatever its precise 'nature' is) is moving and 'doing'? It is critical to realise, however, that at this point of theorising all we have is mathematics (featuring time and space variables, and thus dynamics) that calls for a physical interpretation beyond the empirical predictions that can be derived from it.",

At this point we face the quantum measurement problem, indicating the internal incoherence of TQM. The derivation that led to (2) in the case of z-spin up electron gives rise to a quantum superposition of the wave packet moving up and down in the case of x-spin up electron, in (apparent) contradiction with uniqueness. To resolve (or dissolve) the contradiction, different theories of QM (e.g., GRW, Bohmian Mechanics=BM, Many Worlds=MW) say different things about how the mathematics should be interpreted. These theories lead to radically different explanations of both uniqueness and discreteness. 8 Egg's attempt to read an 'effective' ontology off textbooks, while rejecting \"the fundamentalist's requirements on a 'clear interpretation\"', leads to theoretical tensions between TQM and the various purportedly coherent theoretical schemes that can explain both uniqueness and discreteness. To the extent these schemes are regarded as candidate research programmes the realist should acknowledge the potential for tensions comparable to those discussed above in connection with forces. (In the latter case these tensions occur in relation an already accepted body of theory, while in the case of TQM they occur in relation to candidate theories.) Egg denies that these schemes seek to replace TQM. He claims that should be rather viewed as 'more fundamental theories' that recover TQM. 9 I disagree (in as far as TQM 7 The Bohr magneton \u03bc captures the strength of the electron's magnetic moment due to spin. \u03b7 is a constant characterising the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field. d is a constant that captures the width of the Gaussian wave packet. 8 Sebens explicitly acknowledges this: \"When I say that non-relativistic quantum mechanics can explain these features of Stern-Gerlach experiments, I mean that the theory can do so once it has been formulated in a precise way and the measurement problem has been solved.\" (p. 17-18) 9 E.g. \"I do not know of any minimalist Bohmian explanation of spin-related phenomena that seeks to replace what TQM teaches about spin. Rather, such explanations seek to recover the TQM account and to provide a firm ontological basis for it.\" (p. 14) provides an explanatory ontology). The explanatory frameworks are radically divergent, and there is no 'natural domain' (in Egg's sense, cf. \u00a72) where BM, for example, reduces to TQM.",

By contrast MW explains uniqueness by reference to the emergence of dynamically independent branches due to decoherence. Egg ( \u00a74. 3) notes that the underdetermination regarding wavefunction collapse is not principled, but rather open to empirical investigation.

            "text": "There is also tension in the explanations of discreteness. Let's focus on the contrast between TQM and BM. In TQM the whole wave packet for an electron in z-spin-up eigenstate moves up due to its interaction with the magnetic field, as per textbook analyses. (These analyses typically involve formal analogies of classical Larmor precession of a magnetic moment about a magnetic field.) That's all there is to it. In BM the wavepacket is accompanied by the particle that moves up. If x-spin-up electron is fed into the same device, the wave packet splits into two components, one going up and one down, and in BM only one of the components is accompanied by the particle, depending on its (unknowable) starting position being either above or below the unique critical trajectory (Norsen, 2014) . If the electron is now measured as z-spin up, say, this is due to its initial location; the very same electron would have come out as z-spin down if the polarity of the magnet was reversed. This exemplifies the contextuality of spin properties. Mathematically the wavefunction is equally involved in both analyses, of course, but its ontological and explanatory status can be very different, with BM in particular being arguably compatible with a purely nomological construal of the wavefunction. 10 This difference is particularly critical in connection with phenomena involving more than one Stern-Gerlach magnets. Textbook accounts of sequential Stern-Gerlach experiments (in which a z-spin up beam is fed into an x-spin measurement, and so on) differ radically from how BM accounts for the measurement statistics and the associated Heisenberg uncertainty relations. Ditto for Bell experiments on spin-singlet states. Norsen (ibid.) provides a clear discussion of both types of experiments, emphasising how BM explanations bring to the fore the contextuality of properties such as 'being z-spin up', for example. This illustrates how BM would replace TQM's account of spin in significant ways (in so far as the latter actually tries to explain quantum behaviour in terms of electrons' property of spin). dependence on energy and length scales. No comparable relationship holds between TQM and BM, GRW, or MW. While Williams' and Fraser's realist strategies in the context of QFT are underwritten by specific formal features of effective field theories, Egg's conception of effective ontology is couched in much broader functional terms that leads to ontological promiscuity.",

            "text": "The importance of contextuality of spin in BM is emphatically underlined by Norsen: The key question, though, is precisely whether any such property exists. As has been discussed [by Daumer et al. (1996) ], the real lesson to be taken away from examining the pilot-wave perspective on spin is that so-called \"contextual properties\" (like the individual spin components in the pilot-wave theory) are not properties at all. They simply do not exist and there is nothing mysterious about this at all. (p. 346, my emphasis)The contextuality of spin in BM means that it is not real as a property of quantum particles, full stop. It doesn't mean that spin is only real as quantum system's emergent property (like temperature), say, while not being a 'fundamental property'.Norsen also rightly calls out the \"schizophrenia\" of the quantum textbook's treatment of spin, the conceptual incoherence of the ontological \"double-speak\" in relation to the spin as explanatory of electron's interaction with the magnetic field. 11 The effective realist cannot read the reality of spin and \"what happens inside a Stern-Gerlach\" magnet from the quantum textbooks without facing up to this lack of coherence, and she furthermore risks conceptual incoherence with more fundamental physics if BM is on the table. Of course, spin is still 'real' (in a sense) even in BM, but it is so in a way that is comparable to the 'fictitious' forces in classical mechanics. 12",

            "text": "I have problematised Egg's notion of \"effective ontology\" in general terms and I have illustrated the problem in relation to both quantum mechanics and Newtonian mechanics. I have argued that effective ontology is overly promiscuous and in tension with how physics deals with theoretical inconsistencies by adjudicating ontological commitments in a more fine-grained manner. I leave it to further work to explore the extent to which these issues may or may not apply to other effective realist arguments. 13 A notable difference between Egg's effective ontology and the effective realism defended by Williams (2019) and Fraser (2018 Fraser ( , 2020 in connection with quantum field theory is that the latter explicitly relies on the effective QFT models'Publisher's note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
