It consisted of 38 items, investigating demographic, social, and working status (gender, age, civil status, the total number of households and of family members aged >65-year-old, years worked in the hospital, type of profession, department, changes in working schedules since the beginning of the outbreak. A few items on previous medical or psychological fragilities have been also explored, such as presence of chronic diseases, alcohol drinking, drugs consumption, smoking status and number of cigarettes per-day, social media use, history of anxiety and medical therapy). Moreover, positive coping attitudes have also been asked (such as time spent doing hobbies or physical activity). Inspiring to the DSM-5, acute stress symptoms have been investigated (eating behavior changes, new symptoms occurring in the last three weeks, number of hours spent to get information and to speak about COVID-19, detachment from family due to the confinement, stress behaviors in children, change in physical contacts). Moreover, need for psychological support (actual perception of the need for qualified psychological support and overall trust in the future) was asked. We decided to not use previously validated scales to catch behaviors and psychological changes associated with the peculiar emergency situation, as explorative surveys have been a method already adopted for other research about pandemics (9) (10) (11) .",
