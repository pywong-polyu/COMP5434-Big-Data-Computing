            "text": "In contrast to the elderly, children seem to be protected from the disease. This differs from influenza, which effectively infects children and causes significant morbidity and mortality, especially in low-income countries. The precise reasons for this protection remain unknown but may be multifactorial. The lack of comorbidities or the presence of a robust innate inflammatory response has been speculated. Surprisingly, an interesting phenomenon was described in some children who successfully recovered from COVID-19 but then presented with MIS-C. The level of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 was elevated in a significant percentage of these children [5] . Interestingly, this inflammatory disease is not associated with the early disease severity in these children, and many of them were only found to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by antibody testing [5] . These cases hint that children may have a robust early inflammatory response that allows them to effectively clear the invading virus to limit disease manifestation, but this potentially makes them more prone to inflammatory sequelae such as MIS-C.",

A diverse set of comorbidities have been identified that render the population more susceptible to infections. It is not known whether these comorbidities converge at a single biological event that renders patients vulnerable. Our recent study shows that patients with persistent viral presence have a significantly worse disease and disease-associated outcomes, suggesting impaired viral clearance as a key underlying factor that determines disease severity [7] . Similarly, others have found that severe cases have much higher viral load and prolonged viral persistence compared to mild infections [8] . The strongest evidence to support the role of persistent viral infections in mediating the lethality in COVID-19 comes from the deceased patients who maintain their viral positivity until their death [9] .",

The depletion is specific to the T-cells, which include both helper CD4 + cells and cytotoxic CD8 + T-cells. The depletion of T-cells has been reported by almost all studies comparing the disease severity in patients, including ours [7, 9] . Of significance, the depletion in the T-cell population is observed long before other markers of disease severity are observed, suggesting T-cell depletion directly contributes to the impaired antiviral immune response. We believe that impaired antiviral immunity leads to persistent viral presence and associated disease severity.",

            "text": "Some researchers have been suggesting the role of inflammatory cytokines in mediating the disease severity, a term often referred to as \"cytokine storm\". We believe that elevated inflammation is more likely a consequence of the uncontrolled viral infection. Most of the data suggest that an increase in inflammation occurs at later stages of the disease, which may be mediated by damage that is already caused by persistent viral replication in the lung. Inhibiting inflammation at an early time point may be detrimental to the patient's ability to effectively clear the infection and can be counterproductive in limiting the disease severity. A recent large-scale study using dexamethasone supports this notion where dexamethasone improved disease outcome in patients with mechanical ventilation but impaired the host recovery in patients who were relatively healthy and were not on oxygen therapy [10] . The effectiveness of anti-inflammatory therapies in later stages of the disease may also be of limited value as active viral replication continues in patients for prolonged periods and until death in those who succumb to the infection. Inhibition of inflammation may be more suitable for patient populations who effectively clear the viral infection or could be used alongside effective antiviral agents. Inhibition of inflammation could also be beneficial in those who have chronic consequences of exaggerated inflammatory responses such as children, which may help avoid inflammatory sequelae such as MIS-C.",
