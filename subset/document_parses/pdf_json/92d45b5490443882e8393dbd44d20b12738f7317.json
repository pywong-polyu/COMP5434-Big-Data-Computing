Impacting the developed and developing world including Indonesia. It has transformed social, economic and political practices social life, everyday habits and government policies, with multi-dimensional consequences on human life. The present study endeavours to explore the relationship between religiosity, social capital, and psychological well-being of the general public, particularly in terms of coping with the pandemic. In addition to this, the study aims to highlight the importance of public awareness regarding social distancing, use of religion as a coping mechanism, and living a healthy lifestyle during pandemic. For knowing the perception of the masses, an online survey by using a self-administered questionnaire was carried out among coronavirus patients, the general public, social media activists, students, and professionals across Indonesia. The findings indicate that the pandemic has altered the lifestyle of the masses in different ways and that people have varied perceptions towards this virus regarding its spread and preventive measures. The study also reveals that, social capital (\u03b2 = .418, p < .001), psychological well-being (\u03b2 = .343, p < .001), and religious coping (\u03b2 = .145, p <. 01) have a significant amount of the variance of coronavirus situational stress (F = 69.77, p < .001, R2 = 0.485). Lastly, the study suggests that, adopting preventative measures, standard operating procedures that are sustainable and healthy forms of coping with the pandemic will be equally as important as medical care in order to contain and eventually eradicate the virus.",

Whatever humankind has achieved in the name of development; seems to have been affected during the pandemic such as human suffering, particularly vulnerable and marginalised communities. It is wreaking unfathomed sickness, and high death tolls which has exacerbated existing global issues. The current situation has not only affected how people interact, their lifestyles and social relationships but has also created predicaments in utilising cognitive abilities, availing knowledge and meeting goals due to the strain caused by COVID-19. The approaches, models, thoughts, and paradigms of recent events has exposed the inability of existing infrastructure to respond to the situation effectively. The development and advancement in human thoughts are influenced by multiple factors specifically philosophy, science and technology, belief and ideology and these need to be revamped constantly to keep human life in order. However, time invites humanity to ponder over this pandemic as a whistle-blower for those who have lived for worldly pursuits, ignoring the spiritual side of human existence.",

It consists of two components i.e. emotional well-being and cognitive well-being. Emotional well-being is defined as the frequency of experiencing positive emotions by individuals more, as compared to that of negative emotions while the latter is defined as a general evaluation of the life satisfaction of a person (Marcionettiet & Rossier, 2016) . Along with multiple causes and effects, mental health is one of the significant facets of human life which needs to be given due attention in the current challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, mental health experts are playing a significant role in this regard and guiding the public of all ages to combat with mental health issues (CDCP, 2020) .",

Even though governments are taking strict measures, such as closure of public places, including religious places as well. Among different factors, religious understanding is one of the reasons for making the pandemic difficult to combat.

This embedded model can be beneficial and provides a better mechanism to formulate collaborations with spiritual care providers and health professionals. Researches on religion and spirituality have constantly expanded and being discussed in many publications (Koenig, 2012; Weaver et al., 2006) . In fact, scholars from outside of behavioural, social and health sciences are familiar and engaged in religion and spiritual studies (Kim, et al., 2020) . Spiritual wellbeing focuses on peace, stability and an intimate relationship with yourself and God, signifies two existential and religious dimensions. The existential health is concerned with searching for meaning of life and learning how to achieve perfection, whereas religious health primarily is a commitment and attachment to a religious belief (Villani, et al., 2019; Kord, et al., 2019) . Therefore, the full integration of physical, mental, social and spiritual aspects of life endorses peace of mind and creates a sense of wholeness and well-being (Lifshitz, et al., 2019) .

In addition, people across the globe including developed and developing countries needs advocacy, awareness, appropriate knowledge about the spread of disease particularly the infected people and vulnerable communities. The current scenario in Indonesia and other countries demands socializing the masses for the provision of awareness. The primary benefits of socialization during such pandemics are knowing the information, control of social distancing, stay-at-home strategy, and coping with the challenge of the outbreak. In the wake of the spread of coronavirus in Indonesia, experts are urging people to limit their physical activities and contacts. As with other developed and developing countries, the government of Indonesia has also announced a partial lockdown to reduce physical interaction (Olivia et al., 2020) .",

This is a fact that the virus has affected every arena of life across the globe including the economy, education, service sectors, tourism, cross border movement, and many others for avoiding the situation getting worsen. Despite this, people are not staying at home and are regularly moving around such as local markets and streets; increasing the chances of making them more prone to be infected by the virus.",

This particular coronavirus pandemic is being investigated for the first time in world history (Koonin, 2020) . The impact of coronavirus has been devastating. For example, it has been estimated that well over a hundred million people have been infected, with approximately 3 million deaths globally, but on the other hand, over 75 million people have recovered through different treatments (DW reports, 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO, 2019) declared that there was a lack of availability and/or accessibility of a vaccine against COVID-19 till late 2020. The only remedy initially was to reduce travel, limit social interaction, and enforce social distancing and still is supposed to be practiced. Coronavirus poses a serious threat by evolving into a global pandemic (Anjum et al., 2020; Tamrat & Teferra, 2020) with the fact about its rapid transmission from one infected person to others during their interaction and the extent of the contagion in a larger population (WHO, 2019) .Previous studies support the idea that religion, spirituality, and health have grown over recent decades (Hall, et al., 2004) . Basic religiosity measures are associated with positive mental and bodily health outcomes (Koeing et al., 2012; Pargament, 2013) . In addition to this, another research has shown a positive relationship between health and religion (Bonelli & Koenig, 2013) . The findings of the international social survey program indicate that an individual's spiritual experiences are more important than belonging to a formal religious institution (Vaccarino, et al., 2011) . This illustrates that, due to this outbreak, people were asked by the governments to offer their religious practices at home, recognizing that congregation for religious practices may increase the risk of spread of the virus while gathering people in enclosed spaces can be possible without having physical interaction. This recommendation by governments was endorsed by the citizens such as in New Zealand, religious communities stand united with the state in reducing religious gatherings (Oxholm, et al., 2021; Hvidt et al., 2017) so that the spread of the virus may be controlled. Furthermore, social capital and social support are the best strategies to cope up with the outbreak and transmission among humans (Song, et al., 2009) .",

According to studies, there is a strong possibility of transmission of such viruses by human interaction (Jung et al., 2020) . Therefore, reducing the chance of being infected with Coronavirus can only be achieved through social distancing and minimum social interaction within the community. Previous studies support the idea that religion, spirituality, and health have grown exclusively over recent decades (Hall, et al., 2004) . Basic religiosity measures are associated with positive mental and bodily health outcomes (Koeing et al., 2012; Pargament, 2013) . In addition to this, the majority of the studies (72%) have shown a positive relationship between health and religion, and only sixteen per cent have reported a negative opinion (Bonelli et al., 2013) . The findings of the international social survey program indicate that an individual's spiritual experiences are more important than belonging to a formal religious institution (Vaccarino, et al., 2011) . This illustrates that due to this outbreak, governments put lockdowns and people were asked to offer their religious practices at home, recognizing that religious practices as individual state of affairs and can be done with having physical interaction. Similarly, in New Zealand, religious communities stand united and in agreement with the state in reducing religious gatherings (Oxholm, et al., 2021; Hvidt et al., 2017) .

These include the use of masks, washing hands regularly, proper cleaning materials, social distancing, or self-quarantining, travel restrictions and isolation. According to the model of mitigation strategies, university or school closures during such pandemics can reduce the chances of infection by around forty per cent (Germann et al., 2006) . In addition, other studies from 1957-1958 discuss the outbreak of Asian flu, suggesting that social distancing and reducing social interaction, such as the closure of religious buildings, can also mitigate the localized progression of pandemics without the use of medicines (Glass et al., 2006) . The World Health Organization (WHO) and other international organizations are helping states and governments with the production of a COVID-19 vaccine, and there is a need to start a global survey of public awareness and knowledge to control further outbreaks in society. The purpose of the social survey is to educate, build the capacity of affected patients, and provide information about pandemics to the general public globally. Usually, the general public is unaware of these viral infections and, during these crises, it is the duty of social scientists to teach and prepare material for social safety information. Indeed, to cope with pandemics, this social survey is useful in accessing public opinion and people's perceptions. The present study shows that it is a grim requirement to socialize people through a social survey on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that can socialize people to people, and which may reduce the chances of an outbreak of such pandemics.",

Both univariate and bivariate analysis were done where frequency distribution was presented in tabular form and regression was run respectively. Table 1 shows the socio-demographic status of the respondents. Out of the 220 respondents, the majority were male (69.5%, n = 153) and little less than half of the respondents (42.3%, n = 93) reported their educational qualification as a graduate. More than three-quarters of the respondents (76.8%, n = 169) were 18-30 years old, whereas there was only a 6.4% per cent (n = 14) respondent who was 40 years old and above. In this study, an overwhelming majority (91.8%, n = 202) were Muslims and 18 respondents belonged to other religions. We contacted the respondents by way of social media and other personal sources, and people participated from diverse backgrounds. Table 2 summarizes the mean and standard deviation of the construct used to measure religious coping, social capital, psychological well-being, and perceived Coronavirus situational stress in recent times. Studies endorse the fact that positive religious coping has frequently been associated with better mental health when dealing with stressful events, such as natural disasters, pandemics, abuses, and others (Thomas et al., 2020) . The connection between depression and religiosity highlights a possible mechanism that might play an important role. Religious and spiritual practices may affect the physical changes in the brain and can increase the neurotransmitter serotonin (Newberg, 2011) . According to the results given in Table 2 , it can be seen that demographic variables range from 1.20 to 1.77. This indicates that this pandemic undoubtedly represents a significant stressor for many individuals around the globe. Furthermore, other constructs range between 20.00 and 45.5, and a higher rank of Coronavirus situational stress was reported. Table 3 describes a correlational analysis of the study variables. The findings show that the social capital of the respondents is strongly correlated with psychological well-being (r = 0.611, p < 0.01) and situational stress (r = 0.629, p < 0.01). Psychological well-being also has a strong and positive correlation with situational stress (r = 0.602, p < 0.01). The educational level of the respondents is associated with age (r = 0.312, p < 0.01), psychological well-being (r = 0.150, p < 0.01), and situational stress (r = 0.156, p < 0.05). It is also found that religious coping has a statistically significant relationship with situational stress (r = 0.158, p < 0.01) as well. Data from other nations shows that after the government's lockdown restrictions placed on freedom of movement, the level of depression and anxiety was much higher than those observed in pre-community surveys (Li et al., 2020; Qureshi, et al., 2020) , and it raised the importance of religious coping and social support in reducing the circumstances among humans. This pandemic presents an opportunity to further explore the links between religious coping and social support versus psychological well-being. The widespread nature of the outbreak also allows us to simultaneously explore similarities and differences in coping through social support, social capital, and religion.",

Supporting these results, a previous study found that individuals with greater social capital have better health outcomes (Chen et al., 2015) , which encourages them to invest in social capital. A second predictor is a psychological well-being. In the second model, both variables explain a forty-six percent variance of Coronavirus situational stress. Therefore, connecting people through online spheres could be helpful in enhancing psychological well-being (Bano et al., 2019) via bonding capital and a high presence of social integration. A third variable is religious coping. In model three, social capital (\u03b2 = .418, p < .001), psychological well-being (\u03b2 = .343, p < .001) and religious coping (\u03b2 = .145, p < .01) explain a significant amount of the variance of Coronavirus situational stress (F = 69.77, p < .001, R2 = 0.485).

The present study aims to develop and investigate religiosity, social capital, psychological well-being, and religious coping. The quantitative analysis highlights two major findings. First, during this pandemic, due to religious and social support people are likely to adopt religious practices either in Islam or Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhist or to have no faith. The stepwise multiple linear regression shows that social capital is a major predictor to explaining Coronavirus situational stress (F = 142.61, p < 0.001, \u03b2 = 0.629, R2 = 0.393). A study conducted by Mandelbaum and colleagues (2018) found that the stress-buffering hypothesis suggests that people with social resources may support reducing or preventing the impact of stress on health (Cohen et al., 1985; Mandelbaum et al., 2018) . Other studies also show that individuals who have access to more social resources, such as social support, have better health outcomes compared to others with less social resources (Baek, et al., 2014) . Research on social capital and health frequently emphasizes the importance of weak ties and network diversity for better health conditions (Berkman, et al., 2000; Mooreet al., 2016) . Therefore, social support and social capital are social resources, which help people during these pandemics days.",

Education is one of the most significant social indicators for socializing and providing awareness of public health issues. It is also a fundamental social determinant of health (Hahnet al., 2015) . The results further show that education is also a key factor in helping individuals during these times. It is explained that the educational level of the respondent is associated with age (r = 0.312, p < 0.01), psychological well-being (r = 0.150, p < 0.01), and situational stress (r = 0.156, p < 0.05). Psychological stress is associated with education, and its role of support is consistent in previous findings (Pryjmachuk et al., 2007) . It is to support that logically a good education makes strong emotional and psychological well-being (Higgins, 2011) .",

The field of positive psychology has focused on several areas of human functioning that are associated with healthy living, such as social support and religious coping (Salsman et al., 2005) . Religious and social support factors have also generated considerable interest and have been associated with better physical and mental health outcomes. In conclusion, the result of the study adds social support, social capital, and religion to the emerging area of research on coping strategies during the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic worldwide.",

In addition to its physical health implications, the pandemic has had numerous effects on psychological well-being, people's economic situations, and social relationships. This pandemic has altered the lifestyle of masses of people in different ways and people have varied perceptions towards this virus regarding its spread, diagnosis, and treatment. Adopting preventative measures, standard operating procedures that are sustainable and healthy forms of coping with the pandemic will be equally as important as medical care in order to contain and eventually eradicate the virus. In this regard, different factors, such as religiosity, psychological wellbeing, social support, and social capital have different influences. People belonging to various religious groups have several coping strategies that vary from wilful denial of the severity of the virus to seeking forms of being able to heal from it. The findings from the data reveal that there is a statistically significant and positive relationship between praying to God and a belief that the current situation is the outcome of God's will. The present study has certain limitations due to the lack of literature and authentic knowledge on this pandemic.",
