Conclusions: Recommendations are provided for protection of the rescuer (including screening, personal protective equipment [PPE], and vaccination), protection of the patient (including general masking if low risk, specific PPE if high risk), equipment hygiene (including disinfection after every mission), use of single-use products, training and medical measures under COVID-19 precautions, and psychological wellbeing of rescuers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted COVID-19 precautions for low-and-medium-income countries are also discussed.",

Early in 2020, first in East Asia and soon thereafter in Europe and America, countries introduced lockdowns to suppress the steep rise in infections. By mid-March 2020 in Europe and the United States, most ski resorts were closed. Dwindling mountain recreationalists resulted in fewer accidents. By June 2020, numbers of visitors in mountain areas bounced back and surged even above previous years. Consequently, mountain accidents have increased to record levels (BBC, 2020; BCSARA, 2020; Gawel, 2020; Hu, 2020; Scottish Mountain Rescue, 2020) . In the northern hemisphere, the winter season has been severely affected by the pandemic, several skiing areas were shut down (e.g., Germany and Italy) or experienced a massive drop in visitors because of travel restrictions (e.g. Austria and Switzerland). It remains to be seen how the incidence of mountain accidents develops in the coming seasons.",

Abstracts that met the initial screening criteria underwent subsequent full-text review and those that did not meet the screening criteria were excluded. Full-text review was then conducted to determine which articles were relevant. These articles were provided to the guidelines panel for consideration. The panel used a consensus approach to develop recommendations and graded each recommendation according to criteria stipulated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines (Table 1 ) (Guyatt et al., 2006) . In the discussion we present the evidence informing our recommendations, supplemented by expert opinion and experience.

In mountain compared with urban rescue, staff and equipment are limited, more so in terrestrial than in airborne missions. During terrestrial rescue, substantial physical efforts may be necessary. Often, mountain rescue has to be provided in an austere environment with limited material and staff in close proximity between victims and rescuers. The risk of contracting COVID-19 outdoors is thought to be low when acting prudently (Qian et al., 2021) , but care should still be taken when in close contact with patients and other rescuers. During technical rescue activities, some forms of personal protective equipment (PPE) may introduce unacceptable communications or visibility risks or limit exertion and performance. Wet weather and sweating may decrease protection of PPE and threaten the safety of mountain rescuers from fogging of eye protection. Specific recommendations are given in Table 2 .",

Separating rescue and incident management teams into working bubbles provides a degree of infection prevention (Shaw et al., 2020) .

The minimum airborne-precaution PPE includes gloves, long-sleeves, and pants, a N95 or FFP2 respirator or equivalent, and eye and face protection.

In particular, surgical and medical grade masks demonstrate superior performance in the clinical environment and are preferred over cloth masks, bandanas, or commercially available neck gaiters. Nonsurgical masks should have at least two layers of fabric (CDC, 2020c), although some authorities suggest three layers (WHO, 2020b) if medical grade masks are unavailable. A proper fit over the nose, mouth, and chin are necessary for any type of mask. When aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) such as suction, high flow oxygen, intubation, or chest compressions are needed, rescuers attending to a patient should use at least a N95/FFP2 respirator to prevent viral spread. Simple surgical masks are reported to be both inferior in risk reduction (MacIntyre et al., 2013; Chou et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) and equivalent (Radonovich et al., 2019; Bartoszko et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020) when compared with N95/FFP2 respirators. Medical masks and respirators are critical supplies that should continue to be reserved for health care workers and other medical first responders depending on local supply. Masks with expiratory valves are not recommended, as they do not prevent aerosolized particles from spreading. Small children, patients with trouble breathing, unconscious, or incapacitated patients may require careful consideration around mask utilization to reduce potential viral spread. If a rescuer has had a high-risk exposure or COVID-19-positive test, they should quarantine according to regional or national guidelines before returning to duties.",

Some studies suggest that physically demanding tasks may be impeded by the mask (Chen et al., 2016; Fikenzer et al., 2020) . Others suggest that while perceived respiratory effort may be increased, vigorous exercise and CPR quality are not affected by masking (Hopkins et al., 2020; Kienbacher et al., 2021) . Mask performance may be reduced by moisture from sweating or heavy breathing. Medical masks are designed for a relatively dry, indoor, controlled environment and replacements could be necessary for some environments. Medical masks lose their physical integrity or their ability to effectively prevent transmission of microbes when wet (Andersen, 2019) .",

Ropes, cord, webbing, and other life-safety soft goods should be cleaned according to manufacturers' recommendations. Smooth hard surfaces appear to harbor detectable viral material longer than textiles, but are also more easily cleaned (Chin et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020) .

Some have suggested that during ground rescue operation, screening of any conscious patient with a COVID-19 questionnaire should be performed (Massullo et al., 2021) . Known or likely COVID-19-positive patients should be treated with extra caution. The consensus of our group is that every patient is considered as potentially COVID-19 positive.

Their use might be limited during complex technical rescues and in harsh environments where mountain rescuers are exposed to factors like water, wind, rain, and snow. Rescuer exercise capacity and comfort may be impaired by disposable medical respirators during exercise and can increase CO 2 rebreathing (Chen et al., 2016; Fikenzer et al., 2020; Epstein et al., 2021; Mushtaq et al., 2021) .

Intranasal, transmucosal, and oral are minimally invasive and are generally good choices for rescue in harsh environments.
