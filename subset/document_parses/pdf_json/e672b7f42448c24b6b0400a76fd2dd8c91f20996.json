[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] A recent study in Ireland by O'Connor et al found that there had been a significant increase in injuries per 1000 falls and falls per 1000 rides in jump jockeys when comparing injury incidence prior to 2006, to those from 2011 to 2015. 14 The most recent GB jockey injury data were published over 15 years ago 15 and may not reflect changes to the sport's organisation and novel athlete initiatives which have been developed in this time. Mandatory residential courses at the point of jockey licensing in GB have been developed (7-day course from 2000 onwards, 14-day residential course from January 2017) to: embed fitness assessments, diet and nutrition training, sports science awareness, rule and regulation information and riding work. This programme of training also includes falls training and simulated assessments at the point of licensing. To date, there has been a limited research focus on recently licensed professional jockeys. A formal licensing process and residential course may, however, provide intervention opportunities as jockeys are obtaining their professional license to better prepare them for a professional career in racing. Detailed, current epidemiological injury data are required to identify prominent injury types and characteristics which can become targeted prevention opportunities. The aim of this study is to describe injury incidence over an 11-year period in a sample of young professional male and female, flat and jump jockeys in British horse racing. Secondary aims were to describe injury type, location, severity (time loss) and performance (falls and wins) in GB horseracing.",

Injury incidence was higher in jump racing than flat racing; however, injury rate per fall was significantly higher in flat racing than jump racing.

Strengths of this study include the use of national data from official data sources for up to 11 years of professional racing (depending on license date), and these data being representative of young professional jockeys in GB for this period. This study is the first to our knowledge which has excluded none in-race injuries (parade ring, stalls, postrace) from incidence estimates and calculated in-race injury incidence for male and female jockeys. A significant limitation in sport epidemiology research, including in racing, is the paucity of data for female athletes. The presentation of data stratified by sex here is a strength of this analysis. Further strengths of this study include the duration of data collection, standardisation of data collection and the level of routine injury reporting on race days in GB, as reporting and recording these injuries are stipulated in racing regulations.

This study is representative of professional jockeys from the point of licensing in GB. However, this younger (more recently falls trained and observed from the point of licensing) cohort of jockeys may not be representative of all current (older) male and female, professional flat and jump jockeys. There is the potential for younger jockeys to be fitter and potentially more recently fall-trained and therefore demonstrate less falls and injuries per fall. However, there may also be a survival effect, whereby jockeys sustaining professional careers may be those who are less likely to fall and have accumulated varied 'successful' (less injurious) falls experiences or are less likely to injure when falling. Furthermore, these associations may be confounded by their equine athlete pairings. Apprentice (newly licensed flat) and conditional (newly licensed jump) jockeys may ride less reliable horses, who could be at a higher risk of their own or jockey injuries. Recently, licensed jockeys may also make more errors in judgement resulting in horse falls or ride in lower grade races with more falls around them. Previous research has found experienced horses to have a lower falls incidence 20 and horse age and race class to be suggestive of increased likelihood of equine catastrophic musculoskeletal injury. 21 Unfortunately, we have limited horse data (ie, behaviour, age of horse, training, race load, horse injury) to support discussion of horse experience and reliability.",

For female flat jockeys, concussion was the second most prevalent injury, followed by lacerations, with no fractures. However, for male flat jockeys, the second most common injury was fracture followed by concussion. Previous research has suggested the concussion rate to be broadly higher for flat than jump jockeys, although sex was not considered in this work. 15 Periods of relative energy deficiency 22 have been discussed in weight-restricted sports and are associated with changes in bone density, which might also suggest sex differences in fracture risk. Females may be more readily able to make weight categories, particularly as apprentice jockeys, in comparison with males where it has been suggested that making weight with minimal disruption to well-being may Table 3 Exposure, number and incidence of in-race injuries and wins for flat and jump, male and female recently licensed professional jockeys Open access not be feasible. 23 Previous research in this cohort has identified a very low bone density (defined as a z-score <\u22122.0), in 29% of male, flat jockeys but not in female jockeys. 16 Future research in this area could expand on this relationship with fracture risk, particularly given the nature of 50% of PRIS claims being for fracture, 2 and therefore the financial implications of fractures for the industry, as well as financially and functionally for jockeys. Jump jockeys having a higher injury incidence than flat jockeys, and falling significantly more than flat jockeys, but flat jockeys being more likely to be injured when falling are consistent with previous studies. 15 18 Our focus on true 'in-race' injuries could have contributed to a more conservative estimate of injury incidence. However, race day injuries in the stalls or parade ring are important and have therefore been included in table 2, though excluded from incidence analyses. In other sports, warm-up injuries are considered separately to match injuries as these do not involve match exposure. 24 It has been recommended in international consensus statements for reporting injury and illness in sporting environments that training and competition injury data should be reported separately, as there is often markedly different injury risk between these activities. 25 For these reasons, we have focused on in-race injuries as those where jockeys are competitively exposed in competition with each other.",

These additional factors may also be associated with the higher severity of injury seen in jump racing. Given an awareness of upcoming obstacles, jump jockeys may be able to foresee and prepare for a fall if approaching an obstacle incorrectly or if another horse has already fallen in front of them. Navigating these obstacles also leads to slower racing speeds and a subsequent slower speed of falling in comparison with flat racing. These combined factors may contribute to reducing injury risk per fall. Conversely, flat jockeys generally travel at greater speeds, potentially with more runners per race, which may mean that their injuries are resultant of the fall itself and postfall circumstances. The higher injury rate per fall in flat jockeys may be associated with the number of competitors, the force of ground impact at speed, likelihood of trampling when fallen and reduced reaction time to employ fall techniques. The 'going' (racing surface) may additionally be affected by seasonality, with more jump racing in winter months, and flat racing in the summer, with a harder contact surface for any falls.",

GB data from 2002 found 4.2 falls/1000 rides and 68 falls/1000 rides, respectively, for male flat and jump jockeys, 15 and an Australian study estimated 4.2 falls/1000 rides and 52.6/1000 rides, respectively. 28 More recent data from Ireland reported 3.8 falls/1000 rides and 49.5 falls/1000 rides for flat and jump jockeys, respectively. 29 It has been suggested that fall rates have decreased over recent years particularly in flat (4% from 2005/2006 to 2017/2018) and also in hurdle racing (2% from 2005/2006 to 2017/2018). 20 Possible explanations for this discrepancy may be differences in the study population or methodological considerations. Turner et al 15 did not define a fall, and there is the potential for recorded falls to be at any point on a race day or more strictly between the start of a race and finishing post. O'Connor et al define a fall as 'the rider being dislodged from the horse, regardless of outcome' which is similar to our study. Using Wetherby fall data from all licensed UK racecourses, we included all unseated in a race category ('fell', 'slipped up', 'brought down' and 'unseated rider').",

Flat and jump jockeys presented with similar injury types, but more injuries were classified as severe in jump than in flat racing. There were sex differences for fall incidence and injury type, which warrants further study. Future research in this population could be more mechanistic in nature and focus on the higher injury incidence and severity in jump racing and mitigating the higher injury rate per fall in flat racing.
