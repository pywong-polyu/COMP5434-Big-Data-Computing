These findings vary depending on the clinical status of the patient. Zhang et al., reported the identification of 6 out of 15 hospitalized patients (40%) who were RNA-positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their blood in Wuhan [3] . A recent study in Germany however did not identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in blood samples from symptomatic patients with mild symptoms [5] . The only patient identified to have SARS-COV-2 had acute respiratory distress syndrome and was artificially ventilated. A more recent study also identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma from an eligible donor after 40 days after resolution of symptoms of COVID-19 disease [6] .",

Replacement donors are individuals donating blood to replace what has been transfused to a relative or a friend. All potential blood donors should be between 18 and 65 years. All potential blood donors are screened for HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B and also examined to be medically fit. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, questions arise as to whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through blood and whether an infected asymptomatic individual or those who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 should be excluded from blood donation. With Ghana's determination to prepare plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients for transfusion, there is the need to investigate whether blood or plasma donated could pose significant risk of transmission in Ghanaian populations.",

A 25 \u03bcl reaction volume was used for each PCR reaction and this consisted of 17 \u03bcl of solution A (ORF1ab/N), 3\u03bcl of solution B (ORF1ab/N) and 5\u03bcl of RNA template. The component mixture for solution A and B were thoroughly mixed and centrifuged for a short time before addition of the RNA template Prior to using the kits, standardization and validation for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were performed using positive and negative controls. All extracted RNA samples were tested in duplicate on freshly extracted RNA but this was done different occasions. Positive samples were also re-extracted and re-tested. All tests were run using the CFX 96 Real time PCR machine. The PCR was set up using cycling conditions of 50\u02daC for 15 minutes for Reverse Transcription. Prior to running the samples, validation experiments was performed on the CFX 96 Realtime PCR machines by testing serial dilutions of positive control. The reaction set up was 95\u02daC for 15 minute for denaturation and 45 cycles of 94\u02daC for 15 seconds and 55\u02daC for 45 seconds. The analytical sensitivity of the kits was 500 copies/ml.

Notwithstanding, in the urgent requirement of blood, it is critical to know whether SARS-CoV-2 could pose significant transfusion transmission risk to African populations. Our study presented data on 97 symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, 18 of whom had been declared as having recovered clinically according to the Ghana Health Service protocol. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were detected in only 1 (1.03%) of the 97 blood samples examined. The positive sample was detected in a patient who had been declared as having clinically recovered from the virus after 23 days of showing symptoms. Our findings are in line with other published articles which have equally identified SARS-CoV-2 in blood [3, 4, 9] . The persistence of RNAemia after clinical recovery is quite remarkable and of much concern in the light of new guidelines being developed for blood donation. Although the prevalence is low, it's important for stakeholders involved in crafting donation policies to pay particular attention to possible risk associated with blood donation exercises.",
