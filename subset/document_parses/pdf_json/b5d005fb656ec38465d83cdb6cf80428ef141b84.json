This report provides a succinct overview of the major intranasal neural systems present in humans (namely, cranial nerves O, I, and V, and the nonfunctional accessory [vomeronasal] organ system), along with a summary of notable findings resulting from the application of modern olfactory tests to patient populations, emphasizing diseases of the nose. Such tests have led to the discovery of significant influences of age, gender, smoking, toxic exposure, and genetics on the ability to smell. Within the field of otorhinolaryngology, they have revealed that 1) surgical and medical interventions in patients with rhinosinusitis do not, on average, lead to complete recovery of olfactory function, despite common beliefs to the contrary, and 2) associations are generally lacking between measures of airway patency and olfactory function in such cases. These findings have thrown into question the dogma that olfactory loss in rhinosinusitis is attributable primarily to blockage of airflow to the receptors and have led to histopathological studies demonstrating significant olfactory epithelial compromise in sinonasal syndromes.",

            "text": "In humans, three specialized neural systems are present within the left and right nasal chambers: 1) the main olfactory system (cranial nerve I [CN I]), 2) the trigeminal somatosensory system (cranial nerve V [CN V]), and 3) the nervus terminalis or terminal nerve (Cranial nerve O [CN O]). CN I mediates odor sensations (e.g., chocolate, strawberry and apple), whereas CN V mediates, through both chemical and nonchemical stimuli, somatosensory sensations, including those of burning, cooling, irritation, and tickling. The coolness of menthol and peppermint are mediated by CN V, as, for example, are the sharp sensations induced by ammonia vapors and various acids. The function of CN O, a ganglionated neural plexus that spans much of the nasal mucosa before traversing the cribriform plate to enter the forebrain medial to the olfactory tract, is unknown in humans. This nerve, whose disruption in some rodents alters reproductive behavior, 1 was discovered after the other cranial nerves had been named and is highly conserved among the vertebrates, including humans. 2, 3 Despite the fact that nearly all adult humans possess, in the lower recesses of each nasal chamber, a rudimentary vomeronasal (Jacobson's) organ (VNO) and a VNO duct approximately 15 to 20 mm from the posterior aspect of the external naris, they lack an accessory olfactory bulb, a structure necessary for its function. Thus, in adult humans this system is nonfunctional, and no neural connection from the VNO to the brain has been established. 4 Nonetheless, local electrophysiological responses have been recorded within the human VNO lumen. 5",

            "text": "On the basis of morphological and biochemical criteria, the mature olfactory epithelium comprises at least six distinct cell types (Fig. 1) . 6 The first, the bipolar sensory receptor neuron, is estimated to number approximately 6,000,000 cells in the adult, exceeding the number of receptor cells in any other sensory system except vision. The olfactory receptors are located on the ciliated dendritic ends of these cells, whose surface area probably exceeds 22 cm 2 in the human. The receptor cell axons coalesce into \u03f340 bundles (termed the olfactory fila), which are ensheathed by Schwann-like cells. The fila traverse the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to enter the anterior cranial fossa and collectively constitute CN I. The second cell type, positioned near the surface of the epithelium, is the microvillar cell. These cells are said to number approximately 600,000 in the adult. Each microvillar cell, whose function is unknown, contains microvilli. The third cell type, the supporting or sustentacular cell, also projects microvilli into the mucus. These cells are believed to 1) insulate the receptor cells from one another, 2) regulate the local ionic composition of the mucus, 3) deactivate odorants, and 4) help protect the epithelium from damage from foreign agents. The supporting cells contain xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P-450), a feature shared with the fourth cell type, the cell that lines the Bowman glands and ducts. The Bowman glands are a major source of mucus within the region of the olfactory epithelium. The fifth and six cell types are the globose (light) basal cell and horizontal (dark) basal cell, cells that are located near the basement membrane from which the other cell types arise. The same type of basal cell, probably a globose cell, can give rise to both neurons and nonneural cells when the olfactory epithelium is damaged, expressing a multiple potency rarely observed in stem cells. It is noteworthy that the olfactory ensheathing cells, which form the bundles of axons that make up the olfactory fila, enhance remyelination and axonal conduction in demyelinated spinal tract nerves, as well as in severed rat sciatic nerves, 7 exhibiting both Schwann celllike and astrocyte-like properties.",

In modern olfactory detection threshold testing, the subject is asked to report which of two or more stimuli (i.e., an odorant and one or more blanks) smells strongest, rather than to simply report whether or not an odor is perceived. Such \"forced-choice\" procedures are less susceptible to contamination by response biases (e.g., the conservatism or liberalism in reporting the presence of an odor under uncertain conditions) than non-forced-choice procedures. In addition, they are more reliable and produce lower threshold values. 8 The instructions provided to a subject are critical in measuring a detection threshold because, if the subject is instructed to report which stimulus produces an odor rather than which stimulus is stronger, a spuriously high threshold value may result because the subject's attention is diverted away from subtle differences in the presented stimuli (odor quality is present only at higher perithreshold concentrations).",

In the AML procedure, an odorant (and comparison blanks) is sequentially presented from low to high concentrations and the point of transition between detection and no detection is estimated. In the SS method, the concentration of the stimulus is increased following trials on which a subject fails to detect the stimulus and decreased following trials in which correct detection occurs. An average of the up-down transitions (\"reversals\") is used to estimate the threshold value. In both the AML and SS procedures, the direction of initial stimulus presentation is made from weak to strong in an effort to reduce potential adaptation effects of prior stimulation. In general, the SS procedure is preferred to the AML procedure because it is more reliable, since most investigators who employ the AML technique present only a single ascending stimulus series. Unfortunately, widespread use of the single-series AML procedure has led to the erroneous conclusion that threshold measures exhibit a high degree of intrasubject variability, a conclusion not borne out when thresholds are determined using the SS procedure. 8 A modern, commercially available threshold test kit that employs an SS procedure is shown in Figure 2 . This kit uses squeeze bottles containing various half-log step concentrations of an odorant known to stimulate primarily CN I, namely, the rose-like smelling odorant phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA).

[21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Clinical studies employing such methodology during this period have found decreased smell function relative to matched controls in dozens of diseases and disorders (see Table I ). The straightforward ability to quantify olfactory function, along with recent advances in in vivo medical imaging, has made it possible to better understand the physiological basis of a number of chemosensory deficits. For example, it is apparent today that congenital anosmia is nearly always associated with markedly deformed or absent olfactory bulbs and stalks. Furthermore, head trauma-related smell loss is typically accompanied by decreased bulb and tract size that presumably reflects mitigation of trophic factors from the olfactory receptor neurons, which are often sheared off or otherwise altered in head trauma. The smell loss associated with chronic alcoholism has been found to be correlated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-determined 1) increased cortical and ventricular cerebral spinal fluid volumes and 2) reduced volumes of the thalamus and of cortical and subcortical gray matter. 26 The smell loss of multiple sclerosis is directly associated with the number of active plaques in central brain regions, 27, 28 and that of schizophrenia with diminished olfactory bulbs and tracts. 29",

During this phase, tickling, burning, or dryness within the nose is common and the mucosa typically appears pale. The cathartic phase follows a few hours after the predromal phase and is characterized by increased mucosal redness and swelling, nasal obstruction, and secretion of watery mucus. A few days later, during the viscous phase, the nasal secretions thicken and the intensity and frequency of the aforementioned decline, disappearing after about a week.",

Nasal volume was assessed by acoustic rhinometry. Thirty-six subjects (18 women, 18 men) were evaluated soon after they experienced the natural onset of a cold. After rhinitis onset (day 0), sensory and airway measurements were obtained on days 2, 4, 6, and 35. The cold produced a decrease in the volume of the anterior nasal cavity and an increase in mucus secretion, an increase in olfactory thresholds, a decrease in intensity ratings, and a decrease in N1 evoked potential amplitudes to both olfactory and trigeminal stimuli. When mucus secretion of the contralateral nasal cavity was controlled with oxymetazoline, N1 amplitudes to olfactory stimuli were still affected by the cold, as indicated by the significant increase of amplitudes as subjects recovered; however, this phenomenon was not found for any of the other test measures or for the responses to the trigeminal stimuli.

Some such studies have differentiated between rhinitis and secondary nasal and sinus disease (i.e., sinusitis and/or polyposis), although this distinction is often difficult to maintain. Currently, the term rhinosinusitis is preferable to the term sinusitis because invariably inflammation of the sinuses coexists with inflammation of the nose. Rhinosinusitis can be further divided into acute, subacute, recurrent acute, and chronic types, during which acute exacerbation of chronic symptoms can occur. However, no studies have comparatively evaluated olfactory function in these various forms or stages of nasal disease.

Hotchkiss evaluated selfreported olfactory function in 30 patients with nasal obstruction secondary to polyposis who reported smell loss. All were treated with a total dose of 70 mg of prednisone over a 6-day period. Restoration of smell was said to follow the systemic steroid therapy, with the magnitude of the restoration being proportional to the amount of polyp shrinkage. The restoration was reportedly unrelated to the duration of the loss of olfactory function. However, the self-rated improvement lasted only (on average) 10 days after the discontinuation of therapy. Fein et al. examined 18 patients who reported loss of smell associated with allergic rhinitis. Of these patients, 14 had other diseases, including sinusitis, polyposis, and bronchial asthma. Again, no objective sensory testing was performed. On the basis of self-report, the severity of the smell dysfunction was classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Of the four patients who had only allergic rhinitis, two were said to have had mild smell loss, and two, moderate smell loss. Of the 14 patients with other diseases, two reportedly had mild loss, six moderate loss, and six severe loss. In the latter group, severe loss was said to be associated with the presence of both polyposis and sinusitis. Although improvement in some of the subjects from hyposensitization, antibiotics, polypectomy, or various combinations of treatments was noted, a lack of a well-defined experimental protocol employing quantitative olfactory tests and the introduction of the treatments in various combinations without control for their order or time precludes a determination of the relative efficacy of the interventions.",

In the first, Kondo et al. 47 administered the UPSIT to 36 Japanese patients with a history of sinusitis/polyposis and to 131 control subjects. The mean UPSIT score of the patients was significantly (P \u03fd.001) lower (23.80, SD \u03ed 7.12) than that of the controls (32.08, SD \u03ed 3.57), despite some culture-related attenuation in the test scores of both groups. Detection and recognition thresholds showed a similar association. As in the case of the study by Golding-Wood et al., 44 moderate correlations emerged between the odor test scores and the scores on a smell ability questionnaire (Spearman's r ranging from 0.58 to 0.69). In the second study, Apter et al. 48 assessed odor detection and identification in 1) 60 patients who presented to a smell and taste clinic with self-described olfactory loss and were found to have allergic rhinitis and 2) 30 patients with allergic rhinitis from an allergic clinic who had no chronic rhinosinusitis or polyposis. As might be expected, the patients presenting to the smell and taste clinic with olfactory dysfunction had significantly lower olfactory test scores than those who came from the allergy clinic and who were not specifically presenting with olfactory loss. In accord with the findings of several of the prior studies, olfactory function was inversely associated with the severity of the disease. However, no meaningful relationship was apparent between the visibility of the olfactory clefts (determined from endoscopic rhinoscopy) and smell function, regardless of the disease status. Self-reported fluctuations in function were less frequent in the groups without chronic rhinosinusitis than in those with chronic rhinosinusitis and/or polyposis. Interestingly, self-reported distortions in smell function were generally associated with a history of upper respiratory tract infections and were more apparent in individuals with less severe disease. Duration of nasal symptoms alone was not meaningfully correlated with the degree of olfactory loss.",

Of their patients, 13.8% were hyposmic, and 7.6% anosmic. Surprisingly, using electrogustometry, these authors found taste disorders in even a larger percentage of these patients (30.7%). The olfactory component of this work, however, must be viewed with caution in light of the methodological problems with Elsberg olfactometry. This procedure has been criticized on numerous grounds, including 1) the lack of a forced-choice response, 2) the confounding of pressure with the number of molecules in the stimulus, 3) the introduction of a very unnatural stimulus pulse into the nose, and 4) the production of highly unreliable sensitivity measures. 50, 51 In aggregate, the studies reviewed above suggest that the degree of olfactory loss is usually associated with the severity of nasal sinus disease, with the greatest loss occurring in patients who have rhinosinusitis and polyposis. Employing quantitative tests, smell function has been shown to improve in some patients following systemic administration of corticosteroids, as well as topical administration of corticosteroid sprays when administered in a head-down-forward position. Nonetheless, no study has compared the latter mode of delivery to that of a standard mode, and no one has administered such drugs in a blind, placebo-controlled study. Importantly, the limited data available suggest that only rarely has corticosteroid treatment restored function to normal levels, implying that either 1) some chronic permanent loss of olfactory function is present or 2) such treatments are not 100% effective in reversing the disease processes responsible for the olfactory loss. Interestingly, no study has been able to document in rhinitis patients an association between olfactory test scores and intranasal airway access factors save total or near-total blockage, whether measured by rhinoscopy, rhinomanometry, or acoustic rhinometry.",

For example, Kern 52 presented data, albeit preliminary, that the severity of histopathological changes within the olfactory mucosa of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis is positively related to the magnitude of olfactory loss, as measured by the UPSIT. In addition, authors have shown that olfactory secretions are probably regulated by both mineralcorticoids and glucocorticoids. 53, 54 Feron et al. 55 reported, in a study group of 33 subjects, that nasal biopsy specimens from the posterior superior turbinate, posterior medial turbinate, and posterodorsal septum of patients with nasal disease were less likely to contain olfactory neuroepithelium than analogous biopsy specimens from patients with no such disease. Lee et al. 56 have demonstrated that biopsy specimens from the region of the olfactory epithelium of anosmic patients with rhinosinusitis were less likely to contain olfactory epithelial tissue than those from rhinosinusitis patients who were not anosmic (27% vs. 61% positive biopsy results, respectively). Although detailed examination by Lee et al. of the epithelium from rhinosinusitis patients with normal smell function did reveal islands of respiratory-like epithelium interspersed throughout the biopsy samples, such islands were much less prevalent than in the anosmic patients for whom olfactory epithelium could be found. Abnormalities in the arrangement of the epithelial cell types was common in the anosmic biopsy specimens, and in cases where olfactory epithelium was identified, it was typically atrophic and thin, often comprising mainly sustentacular and basal cells.",

Of the 100 patients examined, the primary surgical procedure of 63 patients was nasal septoplasty; of 24, septorhinoplasty; of 3, turbinate resection; and of 10, polypectomy. Although the authors concluded that the surgical procedures, including septoplasty, improved olfactory function, the data for each type of operation was not provided separately, and their general conclusion is weakened by methodological considerations. In addition to not having a control group to examine the influences of repeated testing on the dependent measure, the questionable Elsberg blast injection procedure 64 was used to determine olfactory sensitivity.",

            "text": "More recently, Klimek et al. 81 tested the odor identification, discrimination, and identification ability of 31 patients with nasal polyps 1 to 3 days before endonasal polyposis surgery and six postoperative times thereafter (approximately 1 wk and approximately 1, 2, 3, and 6 months). On average, the olfactory function, as measured by all three tests, fluctuated postoperatively, with best recovery (i.e., mild hyposmia) occurring approximately 3 months after surgery. Six months after surgery moderate hyposmia was noted to about the same degree as was observed before the surgery. The authors concluded: \"This study demonstrates that olfactory function is impaired in patients with nasal polyps. Endonasal sinus surgery might improve olfactory function with best results within 3 months after surgery.\" Studies using ratings of self-perceived olfactory function. In 1997, Jankowski et al. 82 asked patients to remember what their sense of smell was like before and after either 1) a radical ethmoidectomy in which all the bony lamellae and mucosa within the labyrinth were removed, including a large antrostomy, sphenoidotomy, frontal sinusotomy, and middle turbinectomy (n \u03ed 39) or 2) a less systematic ethmoidectomy adapted to the extent of the disease (n \u03ed 37). They were also asked to remember what their sense of smell seemed like at 6-month intervals after the operation up to the time of filling out the questionnaire. The patients were required to mark their remembrances on a 10-point scale ranging from no functional improvement to complete recovery. In general, the ratings suggested similar improvement in olfactory function in both groups 6 months after surgery, and a maintenance of the same level 36 months after nasalization. Some decrement was noted in reported smell function 24 months after the less extensive ethmoidectomy. However, this study suffers from many problems, not the least of which was the lack of an actual sensory measure, the requirement of a patient remembering function retrospectively over long periods, and demand characteristics attendant on being asked to report the effectiveness of an operative procedure to which they had subjected themselves.",

            "text": "Remarkable progress has been made in the last decade in understanding the function of the olfactory system. At the transduction level, the discovery of the gene family that controls the expression of olfactory receptors has been a monumental event. At the measurement level the development and proliferation of practical and reliable olfactory tests has spawned hundreds of studies that otherwise would not have been made, demonstrating olfactory dysfunction in a wide range of clinical disorders and leading to the discovery that olfactory loss is a very early clinical sign of several major neurodegenerative diseases. The comparatively few studies that have employed modern psychophysical tests to patients with rhinitis or rhinosinusitis have generally found an association between the degree of smell loss and the severity of nasal disease, although, except in cases of marked obstruction, no relationship is apparent between airway patency and olfactory dysfunction. This observation, along with recent histopathological studies of the olfactory mucosa in these disorders and the fact that even after nasal surgery and corticosteroid treatments, smell function rarely returns, on average, to normal levels, suggests that airflow access is not the only factor determining smell loss in such patients. Although the weight of the evidence suggests that nasal steroid sprays, when appropriately administered, can improve olfactory function in some patients, not a single double-blind study employing placebos has evaluated the efficacy of such procedures in restoring smell function. It is hoped that the widespread availability of easy-to-use tests of olfactory function will lead to such controlled studies in the not-too-distant future.",
