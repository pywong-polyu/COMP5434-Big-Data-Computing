Data were collected from Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2020, along with data from the same period in 2019. The analysis was done from the onset of the 100th cumulative COVID-19 case through to Dec 31, 2020. We assessed the effect of the pandemic on the worldwide organ transplantation rate and the disparity in transplant numbers within each country. We estimated the number of waitlisted patient life-years lost due to the negative effects of the pandemic. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04416256.",

Kidney transplantation was the most affected, followed by lung, liver, and heart. We identified three organ transplant rate patterns, as follows: countries with a sharp decrease in transplantation rate with a low COVID-19-related death rate; countries with a moderate decrease in transplantation rate with a moderate COVID-19-related death rate; and countries with a slight decrease in transplantation rate despite a high COVID-19-related death rate. Temporal trends revealed a marked worldwide reduction in transplant activity during the first 3 months of the pandemic, with losses stabilising after June, 2020, but decreasing again from October to December, 2020. The overall reduction in transplants during the observation time period translated to 48 239 waitlisted patient life-years lost.",

Solid organ transplantation provides major benefits to patients with end-stage organ disease, including longer survival and better quality of life. 1, 2 Despite the urgent need for many waitlisted patients worldwide to receive transplants, preliminary data suggest substantial reductions in transplantation procedures in some countries since the COVID-19 outbreak. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] However, there is a paucity of available data concerning the effects of the pandemic on worldwide transplantation rates and how transplantation policies have changed in response to risk of infection and death associated with COVID-19. [12] [13] [14] The consequences of COVID-19 are not only due to infectious deaths but also the impact of the pandemic on diverse health-care services, including disruptions to or delays in cancer treatment. 15 However, the overall burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care is difficult to capture since, for many health-care domains in different nations, there are no structured data registries. Organ transplantation is well regulated in many countries, with a specific nationwide day-to-day reporting scheme, offering a unique opportunity to assess the effect of the pandemic on health-care systems. 16 Changes in the number of transplants compared with the previous year could reveal the consequences associated with the pandemic.",

Further more, it is important to evaluate the cost of the cessation of transplantation due to the pandemic, which can be quantified as the number of life-years lost for patients who could not benefit from transplants because of the pandemic.

Overall, the trends are highly similar among these data sources.

We observed a similar trend when we measured the association by organ type (appendix p 6). We evaluated changes in transplant activity worldwide and for each country during and after the first COVID-19 pandemic wave (from March to December, 2020). Overall, most of the countries increased the number of transplants after the first wave to around normal activity compared with the previous year (figure 1). The reduction in the number of organ transplants by month and by organ is shown in figure 3 . Although the number of organ transplants decreased rapidly during the first 3 months of the pandemic, this decrease stabilised after June, 2020, as transplantation centres presumably learned to adapt after the first pandemic wave. A new sharp decrease in organ transplant activity was observed from October to December, 2020.",

Kidney transplantation showed the largest reduction across nearly all countries, probably due to the nonimmediate life-saving nature of this surgery and the possibility to postpone procedures. We found that some countries, such as the USA, Switzerland, Belgium, and Italy, managed to sustain the rate of transplant procedures, whereas other countries had serious reductions in the number of transplants compared with the previous year. In some areas, living donor kidney and liver transplantation ceased. Finally, we estimated that the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on organ transplantation was associated with more than 48 000 patient life-years lost.",

Living organ donation is considered ethically acceptable in the context of a well-informed donor who accepts health risks, and in some cases emotional or psychosocial risks, to improve recipient health. 30 Given the extensive procedures already in place to limit the risks attributable to living donations, transplant pro grammes and donors were probably hesitant for living donors to be exposed to COVID-19 in hospital settings. Living donor transplantation requires elective allocation of substantial resources and planning compared with deceased donor transplantation, which is extremely difficult during a pandemic when resources are being used for acute care and staff are redeployed. Furthermore, for living donor transplants, there is an additional major ethical concern for the wellbeing of the donor. Paired kidney exchange, which depends on major operational complexities in ensuring compatibility between donor-recipient pairs, often across different hospitals, was especially vulnerable to COVID-19-related disruptions in living donor transplantation. Fortunately, living organ donation can, in many cases, be postponed. Therefore, we would expect robust numbers of living donor transplants to take place in countries where COVID-19 infection rates remain under control and confinement measures instituted by public health authorities are relaxed.",

Likewise, countries such as Belgium and Italy showed efforts to sustain transplant volume despite a relatively higher number of deaths per million from COVID-19. Specifically, a pandemic might affect different areas to substantially different degrees. Providing some autonomy to individual hospital systems to adapt to specific circumstances could enable life-saving procedures like transplantation to continue, even as other important restrictions-such as limiting travel or closing nonessential commercial businesses-are imposed. 31 This study shows how international variation in medical practice can reveal opportunities to improve public health. 32 Our research highlights the value of national transplant registries that provide an exhaustive record of transplant procedures and enable scrutiny of organ use and transplant outcomes across borders. [33] [34] [35] We acknowledge certain study limitations. The data sources do not provide granular information on why reductions in transplant volume took place in specific regions. Also, the transplant reduction might have been due to reasons other than the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Croatia had two earthquakes during the study period, which might have had an additional effect on organ donation and transplantation. 36 Addi tionally, we did not consider the different baseline transplant rates for each country. For example, Germany, which is presumed to have one of the best transplantation responses to the COVID-19 crisis in our study, showed a decrease in transplant activity before the pandemic. 37 This factor could account for some of the small observed effect on the transplant activity in Germany. However, our findings could motivate follow-up studies that might require additional investigative methods, such as qualitative data collection, to fully understand decision making by transplant providers and patients as the pandemic unfolded and system structure and organisational aspects that were particularly vulnerable to this health-care crisis. We also acknowledge the possibility of inaccurate ascertainment of COVID-19 infections in some countries due to test accuracy and unavailability. Nonetheless, we used the best available data for this purpose. We are aware that selecting the study period is non-trivial regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there is no standard rule to define an index date and timeline for COVID-19 studies, we established the 100th COVID-19 case as the starting point for our analysis. 19 Finally, we acknowledge the absence of many countries, including all of Africa, for which we were unable to obtain relevant data; the inclusion of nations in Africa and elsewhere should be a priority for future studies. However, we observed consistent results among the included countries from four continents, suggesting that our findings can be generalised to promote awareness of pandemic preparedness and associated challenges in organ transplantation.",

These findings should motivate improved pan demic prep aredness for both life-saving procedures and those that can be postponed, but not without detriment to patient health and wellbeing. Indeed, kidney transplantation is perceived as a quality-of-life treatment, as a patient can undergo dialysis while awaiting a transplant. However, the marked reduction in the number of transplants and life-years lost has major implications for both the health sector and society, with loss of life that could have been saved due to the difficult decision to stop a programme because of a lack of resources or to avoid the imminent risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beyond the near universal reduction in transplant activity, certain countries and regions managed to carry out procedures despite major challenges and increased risks to patients. These findings warrant follow-up analyses on a regional, country, and global level, with qualitative approaches to question key players in the health-care sector, to understand why reductions in transplants and trans plantations did or did not occur. Understanding how different countries and health-care systems res ponded to COVID-19-related challenges could improve pandemic preparedness, most notably, how to safely maintain transplant programmes, both those with immediate and non-immediate life-saving potential, to prevent loss of patient life-years.",
