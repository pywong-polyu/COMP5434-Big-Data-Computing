Involving astaxanthin in diet can significantly reduce MCP-1, TNF-a, IL-6, and ROS in diabetic rats (Chan et al., 2012) . Recently, algal-derived astaxanthin has been considered as a potential supplementary medicine for clinical trial against COVID-19 for its anti-oxidative benefit (Talukdar et al., 2020) . Consequently, there is a rising interest in developing the bioprocess for H. pluvialis cultivation.",

During the first stage, cells continuously divide and proliferate. Therefore, full nutrient medium and moderate light intensity, temperature and pH are required (Aflalo et al., 2007; Panis and Carreon, 2016) . The second stage refers to a red, non-motile resting stage, when cell division stops and astaxanthin content increases. The harvest of H. pluvialis vegetative cells was exposed to stress conditions like high irradiance and acetate addition to accumulate astaxanthin (Sarada et al., 2002) .",

The chemical formations of algae partly determine the nutrient demand (Hillebrand and Sommer, 1999) . Previous studies have focused more on nitrogen (N) and phosphor (P) requirements in the cultivation of H. pluvialis (Nahidian et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2020) . Tocquin et al. declared that a lower N/P ratio (below 1) favors vegetative growth of H. pluvialis (Tocquin et al., 2012) , whereas Ding et al. suggested that H. pluvialis had relatively low P uptake efficiency (about 99.5 G 10.1 nmol mg \u00c01 Chl a) in both long-term and short-term P uptake experiments (Ding et al., 2019) . The inconsistent results indicated that N, P or N/P ratio supplement in medium may not be the sole key parameter of H. pluvialis mass production. Meanwhile, the research on carbon supply and consumption of H. pluvialis are relatively underexplored (Judd et al., 2017) .",

However, addition of organic carbon source like sodium acetate introduces risk of contamination from other organisms, which could lead to slow growth and even the death of H. pluvialis (Pang and Chen, 2017). In addition, autotrophic pre-culture before organic carbon sources addition allows a better performance for cell growth and astaxanthin accumulation (Panutai et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2021) . One reason could be that high cell density exhausts the nutrients in the medium which in turn minimizes bacteria contamination (Wen et al., 2020) . Thus, autotrophic culture to reach a relatively high biomass is essential for both further mixotrophic culture or astaxanthin induction.",

The stirred tank PBRs require mechanical agitation which tends to generate excess heat and cell damage (Kadic and Heindel, 2014) .

Since the CO 2 equilibrium concentration in the liquid depends on the partial pressure of CO 2 in the mixture gas (i.e. CO 2 volume percentage) according to Henry's law (Equation S8), the enhancement of K L a is crucial when the CO 2 volume percentage is fixed. The impact of KLa is analytically related to the mean bubble size (d B ) and the gas holdup (\u03b5) (Erickson, 1990) . To further clarify the gas holdup, it is defined as the volume fraction of gas in the gas-liquid dispersion (Najafpour, 2015) , which is a function of bubble rising velocity (V B ), ratios of height to diameter (H/D), and liquid volume (V L ). According to Stokes' law, the mean value of the bubble rising velocity can be simplified as a function of liquid-gas density (r L -r G ), viscosity (m), bubble size (d B ) and gas flow rate (Q). After simplifications, our model was shown in Figure 4A , indicating that K L a is correlated to Q, H/D, VL, and d B (Equation 4 ).",

By individually increasing the Q and H/D by 10 times, the K L a could be improved by about 10 times and 10 2/3 times, respectively, whereas the K L a could be 1000 times greater by reducing the bubble size by only 10 times. The experimental results also support the correlation described in our model. Impacts of microbubble size, flow rate, H/D ratio, and liquid volume on CO 2 mass transfer were shown in Figure 3 . Regarding bubble size (d B ), the K L a in different groups ranges from 0.0035 to 0.02 min \u00c01 , 0.0045 to 0.0375 min \u00c01 , and 0.007 to 0.0854 min \u00c01 of 554 mm, 464 mm, or 333 mm bubble size respectively. In other words, when the bubble size was reduced by 40%, the K L a increased nearly 4 times. When it comes to flow rate (Q), increasing flow rate also leads to a higher gas hold-up (Ying et al., 2013a) . In Figure 3A , by increasing flow rate from 0.15 to 0.5 L min \u00c01 , the K L a almost tripled, rising from 0.007-0.03 min \u00c01 to 0.02-0.09 min \u00c01 with the H/D ratio of 5:1. In addition, increasing the H/D ratio can also enhance the K L a, as a longer bubble residence time in the liquid (Erickson, 1990) . Nevertheless, the adjustment of H/D does not have the distinctive effect compared to the above parameters. For groups with microbubbles size of 333 mm at 0.5 L min \u00c01flowrate, a 28.5% increase of K L a was observed after raising the H/D ratio 1.6 times.",

We selected five sets of combinations (Table 2) which were close to the minimum carbon supply requirement. (The mass transfer rate of a 5 L-conventional bubble column PBR (Set. 6) with bubble size around 3 mm was also computed.) As mass production, energy consumption was considered. Higher flow rate means with the same amount of time and liquid volume, more gas was injected into the system which will create extra cost (Gil et al., 2010) . Meanwhile, larger bubble sizes require lower injection pressure and less energy input (Han et al., 2002) . Given energy cost and lower flow rate, larger bubble size (within the microbubble range) are favorable. Set. 5 requires both the smallest flow rate (0.05 L min \u00c01 ) and injection pressure, which well balances the mass transfer requirement with energy cost, and therefore was selected as the optimal combination of mass transfer parameters for 5 L-H. pluvialis culture. iScience Article",

The gas flow rates were set to be 0.05 L min \u00c01 and 0.25 L min \u00c01 for the former and later, respectively. The results were shown in Figure 5 . Generally, the dry weight of H. pluvialis cultured in the MDPBR increased by nearly 30 times at the end of a week, with an overall specific growth rate was relatively close to the optimal value 0.49 d \u00c01 as expected and the exponential growth was maintained up to the seventh day. Almost all the cells were confirmed to be vegetative at the final day of cultivation via microscope observation ( Figure S6 ). It was therefore confirmed that our MDPBR can maintain the optimal growth of H. pluvialis under proper light intensity. Besides, the experimental data were found to be almost consistent with the simulated data, which confirmed the reliability of the experimental data as well as the validity of the kinetic model for H. pluvialis growth in Table 1 . In comparison, the H. pluvialis in the conventional PBR grew linearly instead of exponentially and achieved 0.21 d \u00c01 of specific growth rate with only about 0.06 g L \u00c01 of final biomass concentration, whereas the MDPBR achieved approximately 5 times higher biomass concentration (0.3 g L \u00c01 ), with only 1/5 of gas flow rate. The results suggest that the MDPBR could be 25 times more efficient than the conventional PBR, in terms of output-input ratio.",

To meet the demand, a novel MDPBR was proposed to facilitate mass transfer through minimizing bubble size. Our hypothesis of CO 2 supply and H. pluvialis growth has been validated via a cultivation trial in MDPBR, in which a significant improvement (5 times higher) of the H. pluvialis biomass productivity has been achieved with reduction in power consumption. Furthermore, our previous work (Wu et al., 2020) which applied higher light intensity suggested that our MDPBR has a potential of reaching higher biomass than that has been achieved so far. This technology offers an efficient alternative for H. pluvialis mass production and could further serve as a useful tool for CO 2 mitigation and bioproduct production. This study designed MDPBR for H. pluvialis massive growth, and the CO 2 capture ability of H. pluvialis has been proved. However, the light intensity in this study may not be optimal for maximum photosynthesis, in terms of CO 2 supply. The stabilities and efficiency of MDPBR should be especially followed with interests and improved for the practical applications. The CO 2 supply can maintain a 7-day log growth so far; nevertheless, MDPBR can be adapted to exploit higher algal productivity in industrialized production. For the astaxanthin induction stage, whether acetate addition or increasing CO 2 supply will benefit astaxanthin accumulation can be further explored.",

At the vegetative growth stage, H. pluvialis were cultured in an MDPBR with suitable illumination for one week ( Figure S3 ). At the second stage, the algal broth was transferred into several flasks for astaxanthin induction under higher irradiance. iScience Article astaxanthin accumulation at second stage was not mentioned. Figure S4 showed the set-up for a 5 L lab trial. 200 mL of H. pluvialis growing at exponential growth phase was added to a customized MDPBR containing 5 L BBM medium. The H/D ratio of the MDPBR was 5:1. 1% CO 2 mixture gas was continuously dosed into the MDPBR at 0.05 L min \u00c01 , with the microbubbles generated at an average size of 550 mm. The key parameters here regarding to reactor geometry and microbubbles, including height, diameter, bubble size and gas flow rate, were specifically determined. An additional 5 mM of sodium bicarbonate was included in the BBM medium, maintaining the pH at around 7.5 for the entire culture period under constant CO 2 bubbling. Two of fluorescence lamps providing continuous illumination were fixed at the side of MDPBR using iron stands. As H. pluvialis started to grow, the light attenuation occurred simultaneously, so the number of fluorescence lamps was doubled after 3 days to maintain a sufficient illumination. As a result, the light intensity at the reactor center was kept at around 16-20 mmol photo m \u00c02 s \u00c01 during the whole culture period, measured by a luminometer (HOBO-Temp/Light MX2202, Onset Computer Corporation) immerging into the algal broth. 5 mL of sample was taken each day for the measurement of growth. A control experiment was also conducted in a 5 L conventional PBR with the same geometry settings. The gas sparger generating bubbles with approximately 3 mm in diameter was employed at the bottom of the PBR. To maintain a sufficient mixing, the flowrate of 5% V/V (i.e. 0.25 L min \u00c01 ) was applied in the control experiment. The other parameters were set as the same as for the MDPBR.",
