The United States charitable food system, a complex network of food banks, pantries and congregate meal sites, provides food for millions of low-income households each year. Food banks and pantries play a critical role in supporting food security and are an important contributor to dietary intake for its clients. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on sourcing and supplying more nutritious foods within the charitable food system.

Standards were developed based on a review of the literature and existing nutrition ranking systems, while also considering the operational needs and capacity of the charitable food system. The panel provided recommendations for eleven distinct food categories: fruits and vegetables, grains, protein, dairy, non-dairy alternatives, beverages, mixed dishes, processed and packaged snacks, desserts, condiments and cooking staples, and other miscellaneous items. Products are ranked into three tiers, choose often (green), choose sometimes (yellow) or choose rarely (red), based on designated saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar thresholds.

On average, another 23% is sourced from federal programs under the direction of the USDA, such as The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP). Finally, the remaining percentage (~ 19%) is purchased using money from individual and corporate donations or grants [10] .

In another study, six pantries that implemented a nutrition ranking system significantly improved the nutritional value of their inventory [17] .

Fear of antagonizing donors has been well documented [19, 20] and makes it difficult for food banks to turn away less healthy items. However, a recent survey suggests that donors are seldom upset by requests for healthier products [12] . Food banks that have elected to cease distributing specific items, such as baked goods, candy and sugary drinks, advise that it is important to speak to donors \"early and often\" and explain the rationale behind key decisions [21] . National nutrition standards can support these difficult conversations by offering an explicit rationale for requests.",

Many food donations arrive in large pallets containing dozens or hundreds of assorted products that require substantial volunteer time to sort into product categories set by the standards. Additionally, volunteers may lack the training and expertise needed to sort products correctly, especially mixed dishes that contain multiple whole food ingredients. For nutrition standards to be feasible they must be easy to implement and not require substantial additional training. An additional challenge faced by food banks is that healthier food options often cost more per pound than less healthy alternatives [22] (e.g., brown rice vs. white rice). This can be problematic because food distribution is primarily measured and reported in pounds [23] , and food banks have limited financial resources. However, in the previously referenced MAZON survey, 86% of the food banks that implemented a nutrition ranking system reported either no change or an increase in annual pounds of inventory [12] .",

In addition, providing credit for beneficial nutrients may encourage excessive or inappropriate use of fortification in foods that may not be otherwise considered healthy.

Thus, the panel determined that identification of whole grains from the ingredient list was critical to the nutrition standards. Fiber content, which would have been easily identifiable on the NFL, was considered as a proxy measure of whole grain content but was rejected for two reasons: (1) there are numerous products on the market that may be fortified with functional or isolated fiber, but may not otherwise be considered healthy, and (2) there was often a thin margin between the fiber content of whole grain and non-whole grain products that made it difficult to set an appropriate threshold. While using a product ingredients list to identify a whole grain is more complicated, the panel determined that this would ultimately result in better alignment with the DGA recommendations for a healthy dietary pattern.",

The composition and bioavailability of nutrients in non-dairy alternatives render them nutritionally dissimilar to cow's milk, making nutrient thresholds difficult to establish when combining dairy and non-dairy foods. The panel elected not to include non-dairy alternatives in the protein category because there is significant variation in the protein content of many of these products, with some having virtually no protein at all. Finally, the panel chose not to include these products in the beverage category because of complexity in categorizing yogurt, cheese, and other foods also created from non-dairy alternatives.

However, the task of categorizing a mixed dish into a primary food group component can be challenging, particularly for untrained volunteers. The decision to create a separate mixed dishes category allows staff or volunteers to easily categorize products that do not neatly fit into another category.

However, product reformulations in recent years have meant that there are some processed and packaged snack foods and desserts that could end up being ranked as choose often in their primary ingredient category, especially if they are packaged in small serving sizes. To prevent this, the panel created two separate categories for processed and packaged snacks and desserts. Similar to the Go, Slow, Whoa system [35] , no items in these categories can be categorized as choose often. Notably, the processed and packaged snack category does not include minimally processed foods from other categories that can be eaten as snacks, such as yogurt (dairy), apple slices (fruit), or nuts (protein). Many food banks have programs, such as backpack programs providing weekend food for school children, that prioritize small packages of shelf-stable snack items.

There were multiple panel discussions about the advantages and disadvantages of ranking these items, especially concerning overconsumption of certain condiments like salad dressing and mayonnaise. However, research has shown that consuming food that was prepared at home is associated with improved diet quality, and the panel reasoned that not ranking these items would promote home cooking and greater consumption of otherwise healthy food items (such as salad with dressing). The panel also recognized the importance of promoting the inclusion of condiments that are often used in preparing cuisines from a range of different cultures. For example, soy sauce and fish sauce are important ingredients in many Asian cuisines, but they would likely be classified as \"use rarely\" in any ranking system due to the sodium content. The inclusion of culturally relevant ingredients has also been recognized as an important element of ensuring the acceptability of nutrition interventions in food banks and pantries [36] .

The 230 mg sodium threshold means that no product in the choose often tier is high in sodium according to nutrition labeling claims. Further, this threshold (10% of the daily value) is consistent with the sodium limit for numerous American Heart Association heart check certification products (whose guidelines range from 140 to 480 mg depending on the product) [44] .

There is emerging, but still inconclusive, evidence of the cardiometabolic effects of dairy fat [46] . After considering this evidence, the panel decided to liberalize the saturated fat thresholds to allow for the inclusion of low-fat (1 and 2%) dairy products in the choose often tier. In addition, the panel concluded that plain, full-fat milk and yogurt should be included in the choose sometimes tier. Subsequently, this would also allow for the inclusion of many full-fat cheeses into the choose sometimes tier.

As food banks look to implement these nutrition standards, efforts should also be made to better track and monitor the quality of their inventories. These data could be used to inform policies influencing the types of food available through the emergency food network. For example, possible federal, state, and local strategies could include incentivizing the donation of healthy foods through additional tax credits, influencing the types of foods available through commodity programs, and providing transportation and storage grants. Each of these could be improved via a more thorough understanding of the types of food currently moving through the charitable food system and what product mix is needed to better align with these recommendations. An important benefit of communicating these standards to food donors is that food manufacturers may choose to alter the composition of their products to better align with the choose often and choose sometimes tiers, thus making the overall food supply healthier for all consumers.",
