            "text": "Evidence suggests that human exposure to airborne particles and associated contaminants, including respiratory pathogens, can persist beyond a single microenvironment. By accumulating such contaminants from air, clothing may function as a transport vector and source of \"secondary exposure\". To investigate this function, a novel microenvironmental exposure modeling framework (ABICAM) was developed. This framework was applied to a para-occupational exposure scenario involving the deposition of viable SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory particles (0.5\u221220 \u03bcm) from a primary source onto clothing in a nonhealthcare setting and subsequent resuspension and secondary exposure in a car and home. Variability was assessed through Monte Carlo simulations. The total volume of infectious particles on the occupant's clothing immediately after work was 4800 \u03bcm 3 (5th\u221295th percentiles: 870\u221232 000 \u03bcm 3 ). This value was 61% (5\u221295%: 17\u2212300%) of the occupant's primary inhalation exposure in the workplace while unmasked. By arrival at the occupant's home after a car commute, relatively rapid viral inactivation on cotton clothing had reduced the infectious volume on clothing by 80% (5\u221295%: 26\u221299%). Secondary inhalation exposure (after work) was low in the absence of close proximity and physical contact with contaminated clothing. In comparison, the average primary inhalation exposure in the workplace was higher by about 2\u22123 orders of magnitude. It remains theoretically possible that resuspension and physical contact with contaminated clothing can occasionally transmit SARS-CoV-2 between humans.",

            "text": "Exposure to airborne particles and associated contaminants, including respiratory pathogens, is an important contributor to the global burden of disease. 1\u22123 Such exposure is especially important in indoor microenvironments where humans spend \u223c90% of their time on average. 4, 5 While indoors, human occupants can considerably influence concentrations and dynamics of airborne particles. For instance, typical human activities can generate substantial concentrations of airborne particles indoors relative to background concentrations. Examples of such activities include cooking and other forms of surface heating, incomplete combustion (e.g., candles and incense), 6\u22129 vacuuming, and use of cleaning products, 10, 11 ultrasonic essential oil diffusers, 12 and humidifiers. 13 In addition, nonsedentary activities (e.g., walking) can resuspend settled particles (dust). 14, 15 Occupants themselves can also release particles of both endogenous and exogenous origins. Once released, such particles can be directly inhaled or deposited onto surfaces such as clothing and/or skin whereby they can be resuspended and subsequently inhaled. 16 \u221219 Examples of endogenous particles released by occupants include skin fragments 20 and respiratory particles, which may contain pathogens. 21 Examples of exogenous particles released by occupants include fragments of clothing fibers 20 and particles from external sources that have deposited onto the occupant's clothing and/or skin. These particles may include contaminants such as anemophilous pollen grains and fragments, bacteria, fungal spores, and particulate matter containing metals and sorbed semivolatile organic compounds. 22\u221226 Licina et al. have thoroughly reviewed the potential for clothing to function as a secondary source of such contaminants. 27 Particle emissions from occupants and their activities, and corresponding exposures, can vary considerably both temporally and spatially. Regarding temporal variability, empirical evidence shows that typical human activities (e.g., cooking) can induce transient fluctuations in airborne particle concentrations. 8, 9 These fluctuations can be investigated computationally using mass-balance models that are parameterized as functions of time-dependent human activities. 28 Regarding spatial variability, convective airflows resulting from metabolic heat production, known as the \"thermal plume\", can efficiently transport particles released near an occupant into their breathing zone. 29, 30 During periods of incomplete air mixing, such particles (and other contaminants) can accumulate into a \"personal cloud\". This cloud is an excess of concentration in an occupant's breathing zone relative to the room-average concentration. 15, 31 The thermal plume and associated personal cloud typically exist only under conditions of relatively buoyant airflow with velocities generally less than 0.2 m\u00b7s \u22121 . 32 As such, an occupant's thermal plume can be readily disrupted when they engage in nonsedentary activity. 15, 30 Particles within the personal cloud of one occupant can also be transported into the breathing zones of other occupants (or \"bystanders\") in the same microenvironment. This phenomenon has been referred to as \"crosscontamination\". 15, 33 An additional, though less understood, factor that can influence particle exposure and variability is that occupants can visit multiple microenvironments (e.g., work, car, and home) throughout a typical day. Potential implications of visiting multiple microenvironments are twofold. First, an occupant may transport airborne particles across microenvironments and subsequently expose themselves and other occupants. This phenomenon has been hypothesized in the context of \"paraoccupational\" exposure, whereby an individual \"takes home\" contaminants that had accumulated on their clothing and/or skin while in a workplace. 23, 25, 26, 34 Second, visiting multiple microenvironments that contain a given contaminant would influence one's time-integrated or \"cumulative\" exposure to that contaminant. Accordingly, one's cumulative exposure would be a function of the time spent, activities, and other factors (e.g., ventilation) influencing contaminant dynamics within each microenvironment visited.",

For instance, clothing accumulated inhalable and respirable particles (\u226410 \u03bcm) from indoor air in experiments, which were then resuspended during typical human activities. 16\u221219 Such resuspension may have caused airborne SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) in protective-apparel removal rooms in a hospital environment. 37 Resuspension (or \"aerosolized fomite\") is also a suspected cause of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in controlled animal studies. 38\u221240 However, the potential for clothing to transmit SARS-CoV-2 between humans remains an open question. 41 This study was motivated by the hypothesis that clothing can function as a transport vector for respiratory particles containing viable SARS-CoV-2 and, accordingly, a source of secondary exposure. The term \"respiratory particles\" is used herein to refer generally to aerosols or droplets that are expelled during human respiratory activities (e.g., breathing, speaking, etc.).

Consequently, the simulation did not include the potential for relatively rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by sunlight exposure, as observed in laboratory experiments. 51, 52 The simulation began with HF in the workplace where a single asymptomatic or presymptomatic index case emitted infectious particles into the far-field at a constant rate through breathing or speaking. HF did not come into close proximity to this index case, but she was exposed to these particles after complete mixing in the far-field. HM, in contrast, did not enter the workplace. After work, HF entered the car with HM, and the two occupants commuted to the home where they remained for the rest of the day.

Typical human respiratory activities can emit wide varieties of particles with diameters ranging from less than 1 \u03bcm to greater than 1000 \u03bcm. 21 Human inhalation exposure to SARS-CoV-2 generally concerns only a subset of these particles with diameters between about 0.1 \u03bcm and up to \u223c100 \u03bcm. 41, 56 Only those particles with diameters up to around 20 \u03bcm tend to remain airborne long enough to travel well beyond 1 m of the emission source under any airflow condition. 41 Accordingly, this study focused on respiratory particles with equilibrium diameters from 0.5 to 20 \u03bcm. Resuspension of smaller particles is likely negligible. 17 We inferred that all respiratory particles were predominantly solid, consisting of nonvolatile matter (or \"droplet nuclei\") that remained after near-instantaneous (<1 s) evaporation to equilibrium. 57 Concentrations of respiratory particles can be well approximated by multimodal, log\u2212normal functions of particle diameter. 21 In this study, however, a simpler approach was used to represent the size distribution. This approach facilitated ABICAM's parameterization and constrained its execution time and memory requirement. Specifically, particles with diameters <10 \u03bcm were discretized into three subranges based on their likely regions of penetration within the respiratory system: 0.5\u22122.5, 2.5\u22125, and 5\u221210 \u03bcm. Particles with diameters up to \u223c10\u221215 \u03bcm tend to penetrate into the trachea and intrathoracic airways, while particles with diameters 2.5\u22125 \u03bcm deposit disproportionately in the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli. 58, 59 The remaining larger particles were grouped into a fourth size category (10\u221220 \u03bcm) for parameterization. In general, for Environmental Science & Technology pubs.acs.org/est Article particles with diameters \u226510 \u03bcm, there was a lack of empirical data on deposition and resuspension rates for textiles such as clothing. As such, we extrapolated the values of these two parameters linearly from the smaller particle size range (5\u221210 \u03bcm) (Table S3) . Consequently, results for the largest particle size range (10\u221220 \u03bcm) are more uncertain than for the three smaller size ranges. Generation of Human Activity Schedules. This study focused on three general types of human \"macroactivities\": nonsedentary (e.g., walking), sedentary while awake (e.g., sitting), and sleeping. The specific activity that a given occupant was engaged in during a given period determined the values of their interzonal AER (eq 2 and Table S2 ), respiration rate (Table S2) , and size-dependent resuspension rate coefficients (Table S3 ). Particle resuspension was assumed to conclude at the onset of sleeping, though the occupants could inhale any remaining resuspended particles while asleep.",

There, the timeaverage concentration of infectious particles in HF's near-field Environmental Science & Technology pubs.acs.org/est Article was lower than that of the car cabin by factors of 530 and 290 for the car ventilation scenarios of recirculation and outside air intake, respectively ( Figure 2 ). In the home, the time-average concentration in HF's near-field was higher than that of the farfield by a factor of 5 (95%: factor of 1\u221226). This near-field concentration enhancement was due to the source-proximity effect under incomplete air mixing (i.e., higher concentration near HF because her clothing was the source). Nonetheless, inhalation exposures to infectious particles at home were minimal, with at most 0.39 \u03bcm 3 (95%: 29 \u03bcm 3 ) being inhaled by HF under the car ventilation scenario of recirculation.

Figure 3 shows the range of distributions of cumulative secondary inhalation exposure to infectious particles from resuspension across indoor microenvironments. Two additional distributions are shown for comparison: (1) the corresponding volume of infectious particles on HF's clothing available for secondary exposure after work and (2) her primary inhalation exposure in the workplace. The former represents the maximum theoretically possible secondary exposure that could occur. The predicted average secondary inhalation exposures ranged up to 4.4 \u03bcm 3 (5\u221295%: 0.55\u221264 \u03bcm 3 ) for HM under the car ventilation scenario of recirculation, while HF's primary inhalation exposure in the workplace was higher by an average factor of 1800 (5\u221295%: factor of 160\u22129500).

As noted, the volume of infectious particles was chosen as the exposure metric based on its potential to be used to estimate infection risk mechanistically (see the State Variable section). However, several uncertainties in estimating viral dose and corresponding infection risk based on particle volume are worth noting. First, viral loads of infected humans can vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the individual and the timing of sample collection relative to the disease course. 41 In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be inhaled as a mixture of ultrafine virions and virion clusters. The concentration of virions in respiratory emissions therefore probably depends on particle size, 63\u221265 which, in turn, depends on the site of origin in the respiratory system and associated particle formation mechanisms. 41 Consequently, the number of SARS-CoV-2 virions in respiratory emissions, and therefore infectivity, probably does not scale directly with total particle volume but instead with the volume of exhaled particles within specific size ranges. Accordingly, we have reported the percent contributions of each particle size range ( Figure S4 ) to supplement the exposure estimates (Figures 2, 3, S7, and S8) .",

For instance, measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA persisted for days on a variety of surfaces, including porous 100% cotton, despite significant reductions in viability as measured by the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ). 53 Lastly, the dose\u2212response relationship for SARS-CoV-2 will likely vary with vaccination status and viral variant and is not necessarily linear nor consistent across particle sizes and exposure routes. 47, 68 An additional limitation of our study was the model's relatively simplified representation of particle mass-transfer mechanisms. A more accurate representation could be accomplished with a physics-based computational fluid dynamics model, especially for scenarios involving close proximity between occupants (<1.4\u22121.6 m). 33, 48 However, the substantial data and computational requirements of such models generally limit their applicability to deterministic scenarios involving a single, well-characterized environment with minimal human influence.

The exposure scenario was developed to be relevant to the general population, in accordance with the availability of data for model parameterization. It remains possible that other scenarios and associated activities correspond to greater risks of clothing-mediated exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For instance, healthcare workers may encounter several COVID-19 cases throughout a given work shift and perform high-risk activities such as aerosol-generating medical procedures. 70 One specific concern for healthcare workers is the potential for viral-laden particles to be resuspended by doffing personal protective equipment (e.g., after a work shift), 37 which could be investigated. However, it is unclear whether healthcare workers are at a greater risk of exposure compared to this study given the frequent use of precautionary measures in healthcare settings (e.g., enhanced ventilation, personal protective equipment, surface cleaning, etc.). 70 The exposure scenario in this study did not include the use of personal protective equipment, such as barrier face coverings. As noted, excluding such coverings is a reasonable but \"worst-case\" assumption regarding inhalation exposure. Wearing such coverings in the workplace could have reduced the magnitude of primary inhalation exposure which, in turn, would have increased the relative importance of secondary inhalation exposures. However, it is likely that these secondary inhalation exposures would still be relatively low. For these exposures to be of similar magnitudes as primary exposure, barrier face coverings would have had to filter \u2265 99% of the total volume of infectious particles that would have otherwise been inhaled by HF in the workplace. This high level of filtration might only be achieved by a well-fitted respirator mask. 41 The exposure scenario was also limited to a few general \"macroactivities\", which were parameterized according to empirical survey data (Table S4) . 60 Empirical data on activity parameters and particle resuspension rate coefficients were unavailable for plausible shorter duration activities that might Environmental Science & Technology pubs.acs.org/est Article also resuspend particles from clothing. Such \"microactivities\" may include hugging, donning or doffing clothing, and removing a backpack or shoulder bag. In addition, handling friable textile materials, such as homemade cotton facemasks, has been shown to release nonexpiratory micron-scale particles, 71 which could be subsequently inhaled. ABICAM could account for such microactivities if corresponding data become available. This study also did not include the potential for exposure at close proximity in the workplace because of associated uncertainties regarding human microactivities and particle transport. This assumption is reasonable, especially if physical distancing is maintained as a precautionary measure. However, at close proximity, a bystander would likely be exposed to a higher concentration of respiratory particles, especially larger, predominantly liquid particles. 41,48,72,73 Such larger, predominately liquid particles may not have had sufficient time to fully evaporate to solid droplet nuclei prior to depositing onto an occupant's clothing. 41 The potential for larger, predominantly liquid particles on clothing to cause infection is uncertain because of several factors. First, empirical evidence suggests that such particles emitted by humans with COVID-19 have lower concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 compared to smaller particles (e.g., \u22645 \u03bcm) that originate from the lower respiratory system. 63\u221265 This concentration enrichment of virions in smaller particles has also been observed for other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza virus. 74 However, as noted, particles of different sizes tend to deposit in different regions within the respiratory system, 58, 59 and it is unclear whether this deposition in different regions influences COVID-19 infection risk and severity.",

            "text": "In addition to particle size, the type of clothing material onto which larger liquid particles deposit may also influence their infectivity. For instance, hydrophilic textile fibers (e.g., 100% cotton) can readily absorb liquid particles through capillary action, leaving the virus's lipid membrane susceptible to desiccation. 75 These mechanisms may have caused the relatively rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses observed on porous 100% cotton fabric in laboratory experiments. 53\u221255 It should be noted that measured inactivation rates of SARS-CoV-2 on textiles, such as clothing, were scarce [and hence the choice of a uniform distribution in this study (Table S3) ]. The available measurements were also highly variable, with values spanning 2 orders of magnitude between studies. Consequently, the inactivation rate of SARS-CoV-2 on clothing was the most influential parameter in this study ( Figure S6 ). The large variability of this parameter may relate to interstudy differences (e.g., in the material attributes of the textiles used and/or virus preparation). 53, 54 In addition to inactivation, the type of clothing material may also influence the resuspension of larger liquid particles in a manner that differs from solid particles. Experiments have indicated that the mass fraction of solid particles deposited onto clothing that subsequently resuspend depends on particle size, the type of clothing material or weave pattern, and the type of removal force applied, which depends on the activity. 16\u221219 However, as noted, available measurements of particle resuspension from clothing have been limited to solid particles with diameters \u226410 \u03bcm. Results from previous modeling suggest that liquid particles can undergo fragmentation prior to resuspension, depending on the material's hydrophobicity, as well as particle size and removal force. 76, 77 Such fragmentation may have consequences for particle exposure and infectivity.",
