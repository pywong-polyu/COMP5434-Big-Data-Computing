SEIHCRD model has seven compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), hospitalized (H), critical (C), recovered (R), and deceased or death (D), collectively termed SEIHCRD. We have studied COVID-19 cases of six countries, where the impact of this disease in the highest are Brazil, India, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. SEIHCRD model is estimating COVID-19 spread and forecasting under uncertainties, constrained by various observed data in the present manuscript. We have first collected the data for a specific period, then fit the model for death cases, got the values of some parameters from it, and then estimate the basic reproduction number over time, which is nearly equal to real data, infection rate, and recovery rate of COVID-19. We also compute the case fatality rate over time of COVID-19 most affected countries. SEIHCRD model computes two types of Case fatality rate one is CFR daily and the second one is total CFR. We analyze the spread and endpoint of COVID-19 based on these estimates. SEIHCRD model is time-dependent hence we estimate the date and magnitude of peaks of corresponding to the number of exposed cases, infected cases, hospitalized cases, critical cases, and the number of deceased cases of COVID-19 over time. SEIHCRD model has incorporated the social distancing parameter, different age groups analysis, number of ICU beds, number of hospital beds, and estimation of how much hospital beds and ICU beds are required in near future.",

Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 because of the rapid increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 across mainland China [41, 42] . The world has seen the financial crisis first-time a huge decline in stock markets after 2008 and it crashed in March 2020 [43] [44] [45] and because of this pandemic, many financial deals are being canceled or postponed [46] . This paper proposed a new mathematical model to study the dynamics of transmission and control of the COVID-19 pandemic in most affected countries. The SEIR model is a widely used epidemiological model based on the SIR model, which was given, by Kermack and Mckendrick [47] . Kermack and Mckendrick's epidemic model has been very effective in forecasting outbreak behavior quite close to that seen in several reported epidemics [48] . After Kermack and Mckendrick's manuscript, many epidemic mathematical models have been developed stochastic models, discrete-time models, continuous-time models, and diffusion models. Compartmental models primarily depend on differential equations. These models are normally subdivided into many compartments (i.e., Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Critical, Death, etc.). Compartmental models focused on basic law defining the transition of people from one compartment to another. These Models use mathematics to find the different parameters to estimate the effect of different interventions. Modeling can help determine which intervention to stop and which to continue and can predict the future [49] . The model can predict how disease spreads, what will be the lifetime of any epidemic, how much people infected, recovered, and deceased. It can also estimate many parameters like reproduction numbers etc. These models are used in many applications nowadays mostly in epidemiology, and many other fields like economics, politics, social science, and in the medical field. Epidemiological models such as SEIR provide a valuable computational approach to understanding the microscopic view of the spread of disease. These models play an important role to measure possible strategies for the control and mitigation of infectious diseases [49] [50] [51] . These models are useful in cases where disease dynamics are not unclear. It estimates the number of cases in worst and best-case scenarios. Mathematical models are also helpful in understanding the scenario for spreading the disease [52] [53] [54] .",

In the present manuscript, we first collect data for a specific period, then estimate the basic reproduction number, infection rate, and recovery rate of COVID-19, and based on these estimates, we analyze the spread and endpoint of COVID-19. \u03b7 is the social distancing parameter. The social distancing parameter includes avoiding social gatherings and physical contact to avoid the spread of infectious disease. Its value lies in between zero to one. Everyone is quarantined if a lockdown is implemented and then its value is zero and they follow the normal routine without restriction then its value is one. R (0) and R0 are different quantities, R (0) describes the number of recovered at t = 0 whereas R0 is the basic reproduction number that is the ratio between the rate of contacts to the rate of recovery. The basic reproduction number is the expected number, which is spread by infected people in a population where all peoples are susceptible to infected.",

According to the SEIHCRD model for the United States of America COVID-19, cases are on a peak between 130 and 145 days after that it is improving, its speed is very slow but steady and cases stop in October. New York, California, Illinois, and New Jersey have the most affected states of the USA. The proposed model for the USA has shown that between 120 and 180 days, the number of hospital beds and the number of ICU beds required but its count is very low. That time the number of death has 1200 per day and daily-hospitalized cases have nearly 1400. The result shows the basic reproduction rate is 4.5 in starting after some time it decreases and goes up to one and even lower. The case fatality rate goes up to 8.0, after 200 days it drastically fell. Our proposed method shows that the .

SEIHCRD-Model also computes the basic reproduction number over time, which is nearly the same as real data, but sometimes it varies, we also compute the case fatality rate over time of COVID-19 most affected countries. The model computes two types of Case fatality rate one is CFR daily and the second one is total CFR. SEIHCRD model has shown, Spain and Italy have seen their worst times. The result shows that COVID-19 cases of Spain have ended completely in June last or July starting. Italy will be recovered completely by this disaster in August. India and Brazil have not yet seen the peak of the disaster. The result shows COVID-19 cases are at a peak in June in India and it is on a peak in June and July in Brazil. India needs some hospital beds in June. Brazil is going to have a shortage of hospital beds and ICU beds in June and July. The United State of America has suffered this tragedy the most. The USA has the highest number of total cases and deceased cases. The USA takes more days to recover and it will be recovered in October. The SEIHCRD model has shown the United Kingdom has also suffered this tragedy a lot, and it will be recovered in August.",
