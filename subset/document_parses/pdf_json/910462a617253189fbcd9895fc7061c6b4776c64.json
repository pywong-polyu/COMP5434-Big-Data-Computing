Although COVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more than 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil \u03b1-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding with host cells' angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant spike protein, the fluorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly. Experimental quenching data shows a nonlinear Stern\u2212Volmer quenching profile, which indicates multiple binding sites. Using the modified Hill equation, we have determined n = 2.6 and the effective binding affinity 9 nM, which is comparable with the ACE2\u2212spike protein binding affinity (8 nM). Using the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, experimental data shows that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells via blocking the ACE2\u2212spike protein binding. Experimental data shows that the inhibition efficiency for LL-37 peptide-and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than that of only one type of peptide-attached GQDs.",

The UV\u2212vis spectra from HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in Figure S2E , show two peaks. The first absorption peak is observed at \u223c270 nm, which can be due to the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0* transition, and the second peak is at \u223c306 nm, which can be due to the n\u2212\u03c0* transition. 18\u221223 Figure S2F and Figure  2C show the luminescence spectra of peptide-attached GQDs at 360 nm excitation, where the strong emission maximum at 416 nm can be due to the electron\u2212hole recombination and quantum size effect. 18\u221223 Figure 2B shows that peptideattached GQDs exhibit a strong blue fluorescence under UV light. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was determined to be \u223c0.28 for peptide-attached GQDs. The photoluminescence decay profiles for peptide-attached GQDs are reported in Figure 2D , which fit very well with the triple exponential function with \u03c4 1 = 0.32 ns, \u03c4 2 = 2.2 ns, and \u03c4 3 = 7.3 ns.",

The reported fluorescence quenching can be the result of the static quenching due to the formation of a nonfluorescent complex in the ground state. On the other hand, the observed quenching can be due to the dynamic quenching, which is based on the Forster resonance energy transfer from the donor peptide-attached GQDs to the acceptor spike protein. As reported in Figure 2D , the photoluminescence decay curve remains almost the same in the presence or absence of the delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein, which indicates that the fluorescence lifetime (\u03c4 1 = 0.30 ns, \u03c4 2 = 2.2 ns, and \u03c4 3 = 7.1 ns) in the presence of the spike protein is very similar to the data in the absence of the protein.

The observed higher binding affinity of GQDs conjugated with both the peptides (HNP and LL-37) than GQDs conjugated with a single type of peptide can be due to the presence of multiple binding sites in the spike protein in the case of two peptide-attached GQDs. The reported theoretical modeling indicates that LL37 can bind to the spike-RBD in eight sites (LYS417, GLN493, THR500, ASN501, TYR505, THR500, ASN501, and GLY502). 7, 11 On the other hand, HNP1 can bind to the spike-RBD in six sites (LYS417, ALA475, PHE486, ASN487, TYR489, and GLN493). 7, 11 The observed higher binding may be due to the multiple binding site interaction. 1\u22126 To understand how the binding affinity between LL-37 & HNP1-attached GQDs and the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein RBD of different variants varies, we have determined the effects of RBD mutations on the binding capability with peptide-attached GQDs.

Since the binding affinity for LL-37 peptide-and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than only HNP1-attached GQDs, we observed that much higher amounts of GQDs are bound on the virus when both peptides are attached on GQDs. After that, to determine whether HNP1 and LL-37 peptideconjugated GQDs have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking the spike protein RBD\u2212ACE2 binding, we have used human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T). For this experiment, we have used GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number #C1123G). The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information. 26, 27 As shown in Figure 3D , in the absence of peptideattached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus binds with ACE2 on HEK-293T cells. The observed green fluorescence is due to the presence of GFP-tagged pseudotyped virus particles on the surface of HEK-293T cells via binding with ACE2. Figure 3E shows the bright-field image of HEK-293T cells, which indicates the presence of the pseudotyped virus on the cell surface. As shown in Figure 3H , in the presence of LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus cannot bind with ACE2 on HEK-293 T cells, and as a result, we have not observed any green fluorescence. Figure 4B , the blocking capability decreases from 100 to 8% when only GQDs have been used. Also, the blocking ability correlates very nicely with the spike binding affinity, as reported in Table 1. 3.5. Determining the Inhibition Ability for LL-37 and HNP1 Peptide-Conjugated GQDs Using the B Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Virus. Next, we have estimated the inhibition ability for delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions using peptide-conjugated GQDs. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information. 13, 14, 26, 27 Figure 4B shows the % inhibition, which clearly shows that 100% inhibition was achieved in the case of LL-37 (4 \u03bcg/mL) and HNP1 (4 \u03bcg/mL)-attached GQDs (30 \u03bcg/ mL).

Similarly, using only the LL-37 (4 \u03bcg/mL) peptide, we have achieved 40% inhibition. From the reported inhibition data, we can conclude that the inhibition efficiencies for LL-37 and HNP1attached GQDs are much higher than only one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptide or GQDs. To understand better about the above experimental observation, we have also performed TEM and SEM imaging experiments after LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs are exposed to the virus for 12 h. The SEM image in Figure 4C and the TEM image in Figure 4D clearly show that LL-37 and HNP1attached GQDs can destroy the lipid membrane of Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. Due to the above fact, the delta variant virus collapses and spike proteins that are attached on the lipid membrane are removed. The above process helps to stop the spread of the delta variant virus.",

We have demonstrated that peptide-attached GQD-based fluorescence quenching can be used for determining the binding affinity of the delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. The reported experimental data show that the effective binding affinity between the HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs and delta variant spike protein is comparable with the ACE2\u2212spike protein binding affinity. Using the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, we have shown that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for other variants. Our experimental observation using the HEK293T-human ACE2 cell line demonstrated that LL-37 and HNP1 peptideconjugated GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells and the inhibition efficiency for two peptide-attached GQDs is much higher than those for only one type of peptideattached GQDs or only peptides or GQDs.
