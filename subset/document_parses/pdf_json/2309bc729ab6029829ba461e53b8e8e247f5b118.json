Instrumental ADL tasks involve more complex household chores, necessary for independent living, including shopping, cooking, cleaning and doing laundry. 20 Persons living with chronic conditions report increased physical effort, increased use of time, safety risks and need for assistance when performing both personal and instrumental ADL tasks, reflecting decreased quality of performance. 11 13 14 Decreased quality in performance of ADL tasks may cause reduced energy and time for participation and engagement in other types of wanted and/or needed activities including work, leisure and social life 21 ; resulting in occupational imbalance, that is, an experience of not having the right amount of and variation in daily activities. 22 Adressing such ADL task performance problems, among persons with various diseases, is a core area for occupational therapy.",

To investigate this further, our research group examined self-reported quality of ADL tasks performance among n=593 persons living with chronic conditions, and found similar types of ADL task performance problems across chronic conditions. 26 27 Accordingly, the first version of an occupational therapy intervention programme (termed ABLE V.1.0) was developed, addressing decreased ADL ability across chronic conditions causing disability. To our knowledge, ABLE V.1.0 is the first intervention programme addressing ADL task performance problems, for use across gender, age and chronic conditions. The idea of using a programme applicable across gender, age and chronic conditions is in accordance with Wade's 28 bio-psycho-social approach within rehabilitation, suggesting to focus on limitations in relation to activities rather than diagnosis during the process of rehabilitation.",

Following the feasibility study, a randomised controlled pilot study was conducted in the same context as the potential full-scale trial. The pilot study assessed feasibility in terms of trial procedures, adherence, appropriateness of additional outcome measurements and accessability to information on what was delivered in the control group (usual occupational therapy). 31 The results suggested few adjustments on outcome measurements, inclusion criteria and extraction of information on usual occupational therapy. 31 Moreover, information gathered in the pilot study suggested that ABLE V.2.0 differs from usual occupational therapy by building on a systematic, profession-specific, client-centred, problemsolving approach, including assessments, goalsetting and specified intervention components. 31 Therefore, ABLE V.2.0 is considered superior to usual occupational therapy.

Determine the effectiveness of ABLE V.2.0, compared with usual occupational therapy, in persons experiencing decreased ADL ability following chronic conditions. It is hypothesised that participants receiving ABLE V.2.0 will achieve: a. A significantly higher increase in self-reported ADL task performance and/or a significantly higher increase in observed ADL motor ability (coprimary outcomes). b. A significantly higher increase in self-reported satisfaction with ADL task performance and/or a significantly higher increase in observed ADL process ability (secondary outcomes). 2. Explore outcomes related to occupational balance, perceived problems and general health. ",

In the ADL-I, the clients report their perceived ADL ability for each of 47 ADL items using seven response categories ranging from 'I perform the task independently without use of extra time or effort and without risk' to 'the task is performed by others for me-I cannot participate actively'. 41 45 Moreover, ADL-I is used to measure the client's perceived satisfaction with the quality of performance for each of the 47 ADL tasks, using a 4-point ordinal satisfaction scale ranging from 'very satisfied' to 'very dissatisfied' (ADL-I satisfaction). 41 To measure changes in self-reported quality of ADL task performance and satisfaction, the 47 ordinal quality of performance and satisfaction scores are transformed into overall linear (interval scale) measures of selfreported quality of ADL task performance and satisfaction, adjusted for the difficulty of the ADL tasks, based on Rasch measurement methods. 41 The measures are expressed in logits (log-odds probability units). 14 41 Previous studies indicate that ADL-I can be used to generate valid and reliable linear measures of selfreported quality of ADL task performance among persons living with chronic conditions, 11 13 41 and furthermore, that the instrument is sensitive to change in older persons receiving a home-based reablement programme. 30 46 According to the ADL-I manual, 45 a difference of \u22650.64 logits indicates a clinically relevant difference in selfreported ADL task performance.",

A flow chart will capture information on reach, including number of sessions received (ie, the participants' contact with the intervention). 32 Goal Attainment Scale GAS, 42 43 used for goal setting in session 2 and re-evaluation in the final session of ABLE V.2.0, informs about goal attainment. Since the collaboration on goal setting is an important part of ABLE V.2.0, GAS is chosen as a process outcome. The level of goal attainment is described using an ordinal scale from \u22122 to +2. The actual level of performance is described at level \u22121, and the expected level is described at level 0. Levels +1 and +2 are descriptions of what the person will be able to, if he or she achieves more than expected. Level \u22122 describes the level, where the person achieves less than expected.

The study is conducted in a 'real-world context' and will generate new knowledge on the effectiveness of ABLE V.2.0 on ADL ability, how the programme functions and the cost-effectiveness of the programme. The evaluation will provide important knowledge in case of recommending implementation in municipal settings. 29 The strengths of the planned study design include a strategy to reach a relatively high response rate. Hence, all assessor visits are agreed on in a telephone conversation and followed by a letter with information on the agreement. Further, to obtain a more complete data set, the assessors collect the questionnaires during participant visits. Recruitment procedures are developed to ensure recruitment of persons matching the aims of the intervention, that, a less biased sample. 74 75 However, considering the target group of the study, being mostly elderly and frail persons, withdrawel is expected. This, due to the burden of study-related activities or due to development in their condition. To accommodate this, and based on recommendation from the pilot study, the number of questionnaires is low. 31 While the design of an effectiveness, process and costeffectiveness study conducted alongside each other is considered a strength, it is also important to recognise inherent limitations. In the intervention group, activities related to the process evaluation are applied, including filling in registration forms after each session and interviews with eight participants post intervention. To balance the attention in the two groups, the same number of interviews is conducted with participants in the control group, as a separate process evaluation of the usual occupational therapy services. Still, to avoid affecting what is delivered in the control group, a replacement for the registration forms is not applied in the control group. In terms of the qualitative interviews conducted as part of the process evaluation, the primary investigator is involved as interviewer in the client interviews and the focus group, to exploit her insight in the ABLE programme theory. As the ABLE OTs cooperate with her during the intervention period, and the participants talk to her on the phone when recruited, their reporting may be affected.",
