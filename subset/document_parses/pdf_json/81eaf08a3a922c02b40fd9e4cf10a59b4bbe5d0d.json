The SIR model was modified by taking time-dependent rate parameters. From this modified SIR model, the basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number, herd immunity, and herd immunity threshold is redefined. The re-outbreak of the COVID-19 is a real threat to various countries. We have used the above-mentioned quantities to find the reasons behind the re-outbreak of this disease. Also, the effectiveness of herd immunity to prevent an epidemic has been analyzed with respect to this model. We have also tried to show that there are certain universal aspects in the spread and containment of the disease in various countries for a short period of time. Finally, we have also analyzed the current pandemic situation in India and have attempted to discuss the possibilities in order to predict its future behavior using our model.",

Also, some countries like Italy, Russia, Germany have faced a re-outbreak of this disease. COVID-19 pandemic is not only affecting public health but also affecting social health, world economy, and countries' economy.

As a result of this, the herd immunity of the population is forced to remain low. Despite the low herd immunity, it is also seen that, as in the case of COVID-19, the number of infected cases reached some peak value and then started to fall off in many countries. This requires a different explanation from the ones that have been previously proposed. We have tried to explain this aspect with the modified SIR model and have used the data of COVID-19 from various countries to verify them. The data used for this analysis is taken from \"The Humanitarian Data Exchange\". 23 However, such low herd immunity of a population can bring a resurgence to the epidemic. This phenomenon is often termed in literature as reinfection or re-outbreak. Various authors have addressed this issue earlier. 24, 25 Here, we have tried to discuss this fact with the help of Effective reproduction number (R i ), Herd immunity of the population (HI i ), and Herd immunity threshold of the population (HIT ).",

Thus the behavior and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic could have common features in different countries. We have tried to address this aspect by searching for universal features in the parameters of our model. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 deals with a discussion of the basic and modified SIR models along with the reproduction numbers, herd immunity, and herd immunity threshold. Section 3 consists of various simulations of the modified SIR model by considering imaginary parameter values and conditions. In section 4 we try to find the time variation of the model parameters in light of the COVID-19 data for several countries. In section 5 we present a brief study of the COVID-19 behavior in India and the last section, we present our concluding remarks.",

However, it also depends on the social behavior and social interaction of a region, which can vary with time. Also, when an epidemic starts, governments in those regions try to contain the spread of the disease by locking that region down or part of it, making rules to prevent infections (like maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, and spreading awareness among the people). Hence the rate of infection \u03b2 will not be constant always. Here we assume that the rate of infection \u03b2 is a time-dependent quantity. Also removed rate \u03b3 can be time-dependent. It is mentioned earlier that increment of the removed rate depends not only on the recovery of infected people, also on the death rate or fatality rate of the disease. So, in general, the removed rate can be changed if the recovered rate or death rate is changed. Initially, knowledge among the doctors and scientists is limited for a new disease. But as time goes by the knowledge about that disease will increase and this may help to improve the recovered rate. On the other hand, there are factors such as medical infrastructure, infectivity of the disease etc. which directly affect the recovered rate and the death rate. Thus it is difficult to disentangle these two effects in the current purview of our model and it would be only possible to predict the total increment of the removed rate as a function of both. We would be interested to extend this model and study these two effects separately in future to better predict the behaviors of the deceased rate and the recovered rate.",

Also, it is seen in figure 2 that due to government's intervention at t = t I = 10, the curve of R i (t) decreases fast as compared to no intervention. We found that at the end of the epidemic, the number of susceptible people left in the population is approximately 3111 and 1290 for intervention-1 and intervention-2 respectively. So, interventions help to decrease the total number of infections. Also from figure 2, we can see that if the intervention is more strict then the epidemic will take more time to reach the peak. intervention-2 (right). Figure 3 shows the variation of herd immunity HI i (t) for the two interventions. But we can see that there are some basic differences between these herd immunity plots. For both cases, the maximum value of herd immunity threshold is HIT max = 0.7857. Due to the intervention, the herd immunity threshold value is reduced from the maximum value to 0.4 and 0.5714 for intervention-1 and intervention-2 respectively. Here, the reduced value of the herd immunity threshold due to the intervention is represented by HIT in . As, the difference between the HIT max and HIT in2 for intervention-2 is small, thus the herd immunity at the end of the epidemic (HI i (\u221e)) not just goes beyond the HIT in2 also it crosses HIT max . But for intervention-1, the herd immunity of the population crosses HIT in1 but could not able to cross the HIT max . ",

For this example, herd immunity reaches HIT max after the second outbreak. But there can be a system where herd immunity reaches HIT max after several outbreaks.

From these fitted functions, we calculate the infection rate (\u03b2(t)), removed rate (\u03b3(t)), and herd immunity of the population (HI i (t)). Also, we calculate the herd immunity threshold (HIT (t)) and effective reproduction number (R i (t)) from fitted active cases (I), removed cases (R), and estimated infection rate (\u03b2), removed rate (\u03b3). Here data are taken from that date when the recovered cases and deaths both start to increase steadily with time (except for Brazil). There are large discontinuities in Brazil's data at the initial time and around the end (01/11/2020) of the data. Thus we have rejected the initial part of the data. We have retained the end part of the I and R data. However, the end part of the active cases data has not been used for the analysis. Table 1 shows such range of dates for various countries. For a country, the first date of the range is considered as the initial time t=0. 9 show how the active cases and removed cases of various countries are varying with time. In figures 8 and 9, the black dashed lines indicates the 95% prediction interval of the fitted data. We don't show this interval in some plots or some portions of the plot because the intervals are very close to the best fit line. Figure 8 shows that the active case curves have different behaviors for different countries. Active cases curves are increasing for the countries like USA and are decreasing in countries like India, Bangladesh, Colombia. Also, we find that a re-outbreak of the disease has started in Italy, Russia, Brazil and has ended in Peru. Figures 10 and 11 show how the infection rate (\u03b2) and removed rate (\u03b3) vary with time in different countries. In these figures, the gray dashed lines represents the discontinuities that come because of the piece-wise continuous fitting of I and R data and not from the model. So, the discontinuities do not have any physical significance. The variation of removed rate is different for different countries. But removed rates are varying in the order of \u223c 10 \u22122 . Besides, we can roughly say that the removed rates are linearly varying with time. Countries like Russia, Bangladesh, Italy, and Brazil have removed rate which is approximately constants with time. Also for India and Colombia, we can approximate that the removed rate is increasing linearly with time. In the USA removed rate is approximately decreasing linearly with time. In the case of Peru, we will also get a linear region in a particular period of time.",

We fit this function to that portion of the \u03b2 in which it is approximately decreasing exponentially. Table 2 shows the parameter values of the fitted function in different countries. We can see that initially, the fitted function has values of order \u223c 10 \u22121 for all of the countries. Then the values of this function quickly decreased to an order of \u223c 10 \u22122 (except Italy). So, we can see that there lies a universal feature among the infection rates (\u03b2) for a limited period of time.

We can see that herd immunity of the population is very close to zero and this is true for all of the countries.

Now, there are many reasons behind the small number of infected people compared to the country's population. First of all, as we mentioned earlier, countries take various actions and restrictions to reduce the spread of the disease. Besides that, we only work with the reported cases. However, there can be many unreported cases due to the lack of testing or awareness, which are not taken care of in our model.

Thus we propose two different ways of reducing the spread of a disease : (i) by increasing herd immunity of the population over the herd immunity threshold, and (ii) by decreasing the herd immunity threshold below the herd immunity of the population. \u2022 We fit the COVID-19 data of various countries with piece-wise continuous functions. From these fitted functions, we have estimated the time variation of the infection rate (\u03b2) and the removed rate (\u03b3) of the SIR model. Using these rate parameters ( \u03b2 and \u03b3), we have estimated the variations of the effective reproduction number(R i (t)), the herd immunity of the population (HI i (t)), and the herd immunity threshold (HIT (t)). \u2022 For this COVID -19 pandemic, we see that the herd immunity of the various countries', is close to zero. Also, we have found that the initial value of the herd immunity threshold is \u223c0.9. However there are many countries, where COVID -19 pandemic is decreasing. This means, the herd immunity threshold went below the herd immunity at a certain time. \u2022 We observe that the infection is currently decreasing in the countries like Colombia, Bangladesh, India and had decreased sufficiently like Italy, Russia. and Brazil. In these countries, the herd immunity threshold went below the herd immunity of the population at a certain time. We have also found that the removed rate \u03b3(t) does not change much in these countries. However, infection rate \u03b2(t) is greatly decreased from the initial value and thus herd immunity threshold (HIT (t)) is also reduced. We also observe that the infection rate \u03b2(t) can be decreased by imposing restrictions, like lockdown, or increasing awareness about the disease. \u2022 Hence, the countries are trying to prevent COVID -19 pandemic by the second method that is taking measures so that HIT (t) goes below HI i (t). However, for the same reason the herd immunity of the population also remains low. Thus, a country might face a re-outbreak of the disease very easily. \u2022 In countries like Italy, Russia and Brazil, we see that there a re-outbreak of the COVID-19 disease has occurred now. Here, the herd immunity threshold has increased again due to the increment of the infection rate (\u03b2) or decrement of the removed rate (\u03b3). We understand that infection rate (\u03b2) will increase if people start to neglect restrictions or if the government decides to lift lockdown. Thus imposing restrictions and lockdown is a good way to prevent the spread of the disease. However, there always remains a chance of re-outbreak of the disease and this is the major drawback of this method. \u2022 In COVID-19 pandemic we see that the epidemic is prevented mainly by the second method, where herd immunity threshold (HIT ) goes below the herd immunity (HI i (t)) of the population. This makes herd immunity of the population (HI i (t)) insignificant.",

We see that the COVID-19 pandemic is currently decreasing in India. This is because the herd immunity threshold (HIT ) has gone below the herd immunity (HI i (t)) of the population.

In figures 8 and 9, the black dashed lines indicates the 95% prediction interval of the fitted data. We don't show this interval in some plots or some portions of the plot because the intervals are very close to the best fit line. Figure 8 shows that the active case curves have different behaviors for different countries. Active cases curves are increasing for the countries like USA and are decreasing in countries like India, Bangladesh, Colombia. Also, we find that a re-outbreak of the disease has started in Italy, Russia, Brazil and has ended in Peru. Figures 10 and 11 show how the infection rate (\u03b2) and removed rate (\u03b3) vary with time in different countries. In these figures, the gray dashed lines represents the discontinuities that come because of the piece-wise continuous fitting of I and R data and not from the model. So, the discontinuities do not have any physical significance. The variation of removed rate is different for different countries. But removed rates are varying in the order of \u223c 10 \u22122 . Besides, we can roughly say that the removed rates are linearly varying with time. Countries like Russia, Bangladesh, Italy, and Brazil have removed rate which is approximately constants with time. Also for India and Colombia, we can approximate that the removed rate is increasing linearly with time. In the USA removed rate is approximately decreasing linearly with time. In the case of Peru, we will also get a linear region in a particular period of time. The variation of \u03b2 is also different for different countries. However, the initial variation of \u03b2 for different countries are approximately the same. We can see that initially, all the \u03b2s have an approximately exponential decrease. Here we take an exponentially decreasing function f (t) = ae \u2212b(t\u2212t0) + c. We fit this function to that portion of the \u03b2 in which it is approximately decreasing exponentially.",
