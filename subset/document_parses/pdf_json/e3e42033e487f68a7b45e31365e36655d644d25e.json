For deneutrosophication, the neutrosophic value is transformed into three intervals based on the truth, falsity, and indeterminacy-membership functions. en, a crisp value is derived. Moreover, multi-choice goal programming is also used to get a crisp value. e proposed models seek to draw a strategic plan and long-term vision for a healthcare organization. Accordingly, the specific aims of the proposed flexible models are meant to evaluate hospital service performance and to establish an optimal plan to meet the growing patient needs. As a result, sustainability's economic and social goals will be achieved so that the total cost would be optimized, patients' waiting time would be reduced, high-quality services would be offered, and appropriate medical drugs would be provided. e simplicity and feasibility of the proposed models are validated using real data collected from the Al-Amal Center for Oncology, Aden, Yemen. e results obtained indicate the robustness of the proposed models, which would be valuable for planners who could guide healthcare staff in providing the necessary resources for optimal annual planning.",

            "text": "Optimizing existing resources in health organizations is critical to meeting the needs of patients. At the same time, organizations must develop a future strategic plan of the existing resources commensurate with the predicted growth in the number of patients. Optimization approaches can support planning and decision-making at all levels. One of these approaches is goal programming in resources planning. Goal programming is a multi-objective optimization tool that helps a solution to move toward an ideal goal. In recent years, the use of goal programming has become more widespread, especially for analyzing and evaluating healthcare organizations. Numerous authors have considered goal programming to optimize the resources in health organizations. Parra et al. (1997) [1] proposed a goal programming model to evaluate the performance of a surgical service at a local general hospital. e authors aimed to improve the service under the available resources-for example, spatial occupation, staff availability, and financial support. Munoz et al. (2018) [2] improved a mathematical model based on goal programming to evaluate proposals in order to help in the selection of a mix of proposals. e main function of goal programming is the incorporation of strategic goals that support the vision and objectives of institutes. e model is applied using real data obtained from the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) at Pennsylvania State University. Blake and Carter (2002) [3] proposed two linear goal programming models. e first model is used to determine case mix and volume for physicians under fixed service costs conditions. e second model addresses case-mix decisions as a commensurate set of practice changes for physicians. e trade-offs between case-mix and case costs are balanced using the proposed models and minimizing disturbance in order to preserve physician income. Rifai and Pecenka (1990) [4] applied goal programming to allocate resources in healthcare planning. Minimizing idle capacity and maximizing the profit are the main goals in this work. Kwak and Lee (2002) [5] proposed a multi-criteria mathematical programming model to evaluate strategic planning in a business process. is model is also based on goal programming. e goal levels are identified and prioritized using the analytic hierarchy process. Similarly, Lee and Kwak (1999) [6] presented a goal programming model for designing and evaluating effective information resource planning in a healthcare system. e proposed model addressed the multiple conflicting goals of a healthcare system and the multi-dimensional aspects of resource allocation planning. Also, the model allows flexibility of decision-making in resource allocation. e goals are decomposed and prioritized with respect to the corresponding criteria using the analytic hierarchy process. Grigoroudis and Phillis (2013) [7] proposed a nonlinear programming model to improve the health level of a population under several constraints. e system of systems approach is used to model the hierarchical structure of healthcare systems as well as for dynamic budget allocation for a national healthcare system in order to develop optimal policies. Lee and Kwak (2011) [8] developed a multi-criteria decision-making model for strategic enterprise resource planning adoption by considering both financial and nonfinancial business factors. Turgay and Ta\u015fk\u0131n (2015) [9] developed a fuzzy mixed goal programming model to optimize the healthcare organization's resource allocation problem in an uncertain environment. e use of neutrosophic concept theory in goal programming was first introduced by Hezam et al. (2016) [10] . For more information on the works related to neutrosophic goal programming, see Munoz [2, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

We use the data to validate the proposed models. e remaining paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of goal programming, dynamic goal programming, and multi-choice goal programming. Besides, it presents neutrosophic concepts and deneutrosophication. In Section 3, we formulate the proposed models, while a case study is presented in Section 4. Section 5 reports the results and discussion, and then Section 6 concludes the study.",

Hard constraints are the system constraints that cannot be violated (e.g., system resources and relational model constraints). In contrast, soft constraints are associated with prespecified targets. Both negative and positive deviational variables are added to these constraints and the undesired deviations are included in the objective function to be minimized. e priority of goal programming is to satisfy the hard constraints before soft constraints. e preference structures to minimize the undesired deviations require different methods: preemptive, nonpreemptive, and Tchebycheff. e preemptive variant is used when there is a natural priority structure to the decision-maker(s) preferences, the nonpreemptive variant is used when each unwanted deviation has a relative weight (which can be equal), and Tchebycheff goal programming is used when the maximum deviation from the target is minimized.

A new membership function, called falsity-membership function, was later developed by Atanassov (1986) [24] , who introduced the intuitionistic fuzzy set. Nevertheless, this technique too was limited by drawbacks in decision-making.

We now discuss the results obtained in 2048 as an example. e total budget, total staff, and total medical devices obtained using the multi-choice model are higher than those obtained using the other models. Similarly, in the same year, the multi-choice model yields the lowest summation of deviations. Figures 8-10 illustrate a comparison between the proposed models for staff growth, the increasing medical devices, and the increase in the demand for medicines for the period between 2018 and 2048, respectively. e case study shows that, in the three proposed models, the ratio of staff's budget to the total budget increases annually. In contrast, the ratio of the medical drugs' budget to the total budget decreases annually. Tables 5, 12, and 19 show that the ratios in 2018 are 28%, 34%, and 15% of the staff's budget from the total budget and 64%, 59%, and 76% of medical drugs' budget from the total budget, while the ratios in 2048 are 63%, 63%, and 63% of the staff's budget from the total budget and 26%, 25%, and 26% of medical drugs' budget from the total budget. e obtained results of the case study are almost similar. is convergence indicates the stability and robustness of the mathematical models.

In general, the results obtained using both neutrosophic goal programming models are more realistic and flexible than the results obtained without the neutrosophic approach. We thus introduced several scenarios for each period, allowing the decision-maker more flexibility to choose the most appropriate model that corresponds to other uncontrolled factors in this study. For example, the economy grew rapidly in a specific period, which would enable the decision-maker to choose the largest budget then; the converse holds true during periods of recession. erefore, the proposed models in this study provide sustainable planning for several future periods.

We used dynamic goal programming to predict the optimal solution for each variable in every period addressed in this article. ree models were eventually proposed: crisp, neutrosophic, and neutrosophic multi-choice goal programming. e goals addressed in the proposed models are related to the budget, the number of staffs and materials to perform the tasks efficiently. e proposed models yielded the optimum budget as well as the optimal number of staff and other medical supplies required to provide high-quality service for patients. Our results and insights thereof would be valuable for planners who could guide healthcare staff in providing the necessary resources for optimal annual planning. e diversity in the results obtained from the proposed models gives decision-makers the flexibility to make optimal decisions based on the state of the economy in each period. Although the proposed models were applied to healthcare planning, our approaches can be implemented on a large-scale healthcare system. Moreover, metaheuristics algorithms can be used to solve the models.",
