            "text": "The impacts of COVID-19 on travel demand, traffic congestion, and traffic safety are attracting heated attention. However, the influence of the pandemic on electric bike (e-bike) safety has not been investigated. This paper fills the research gap by analyzing how COVID-19 affects China's e-bike safety based on a province-level dataset containing e-bike safety metrics, socioeconomic information, and COVID-19 cases from 2017 to 2020. Multi-output regression models are adopted to investigate the overall impact of COVID-19 on e-bike safety in China. Clustering-based regression models are used to examine the heterogeneous effects of COVID-19 and the other explanatory variables in different provinces/municipalities. This paper confirms the high relevance between COVID-19 and the e-bike safety condition in China. The number of COVID-19 cases has a significant negative effect on the number of e-bike fatalities/injuries at the country level. Moreover, two clusters of provinces/ municipalities are identified: one (cluster 1) with lower and the other (cluster 2 that includes Hubei province) higher number of e-bike fatalities/injuries. In the clustering-based regressions, the absolute coefficients of the COVID-19 feature for cluster 2 are much larger than those for cluster 1, indicating that the pandemic could significantly reduce e-bike safety issues in provinces with more e-bike fatalities/injuries.",

The data includes socioeconomic information such as seasonal total been found all around the world on how the pandemic affects urban mobility. For instance, the vehicle miles traveled and driving frequency dropped over 30% in Alabama, US [2], the speed of traffic flow increased due to lower congestion level in New York City [3] , and the number of car crashes dropped [4], the usage of public transit fell at the beginning of the pandemic and then recovered in the UK [5] , and people made fewer walk/bike trips in densely populated cities but more in less densely populated cities in the US [6] . Yet, no effects have been conducted on the influence of COVID-19 on an indispensable mobility mode-the electrical bike (e-bike).",

            "text": "The e-bike, a type of powered two-wheeled vehicle that is inexpensive, fast, and environmentally friendly (compared with motor vehicles), is widely used in many places such as Australia [7], Europe [8], the US [9], and China [10]. With a tremendous grown in usage over the past two decades, the e-bike has become a major nonmotorized travel mode in China. In 1998, there were only several thousand e-bikes produced and sold in China, and this number grew to over 20 million in 2009. From 2013, China became the largest e-bike producer and exporter. Now the yearly production and sales are over 350 million. Generally, e-bikes are popular in China because they allow people to commute longer distances and are serving as a high-quality mobility alternative to public transit and conventional bikes. Furthermore, China has been promoting the shared economy, and most on-demand (food) delivery men who are working for companies such as Meituan and Ele.me rely on e-bikes to finish jobs on time. However, ebikes also raise road safety issues because of the fast speed and the less protected riding environment compared with cars. Researchers have found that many e-bike riders have risky behaviors such as speeding, riding on motorized roadways, not wearing helms, or disobeying traffic signals [11] [12] [13] [14] . As a result, the number of fatalities/injures in e-bike accidents has become a major component in road traffic fatalities/injures in China; in 2019, nearly 30% of road traffic fatalities/injures were caused by e-bike accidents (see Fig 1 that illustrates the number of fatalities/injures of different travel modes in 36 major cities in mainland China). The pros and cons of e-bikes could be more significant during the COVID-19 pandemic. On one hand, e-bikes naturally meet the requirement of social distance for preventing the epidemic from spreading and would be more preferable than public transit and cars among commuters. On the other hand, high e-bike usage during the pandemic could continuously cause traffic safety issues. This paper fills a research gap by quantifying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ebike safety in China. We conduct two analyses based on a province-level dataset with e-bike safety, COVID-19, and socioeconomic metrics from 2017 to 2020. First, we examine the overall impact of COVID-19 on e-bike safety at the country level. Second, we conduct clusteringbased regressions to investigate the heterogeneous influence of COVID-19 and other explanatory variables on e-bike safety conditions at the province level. The results demonstrate the high relevance between COVID-19 and e-bike fatalities/injuries in China. On the province level, the pandemic has a larger negative impact on the number of e-bike fatalities/injuries for provinces with more serious e-bike safety issues. Since e-bikes provide a comfortable mode for preventing the epidemic from spreading, our analyses provide good references for the study of mobility and traffic safety during-and-post the pandemic.",

The threat from the virus and lockdown policies have significantly changed people's travel demand and travel patterns. The most heavily damaged transportation sector is air transport, which suffered from a decline of 50% seats (around 2.9 billion passengers and 390 billion USD) [16] . Similarly, rail transport, another essential long-distance travel mode, has experienced 20% to 30% annually passenger loss in different regions such as Europe, the US, and Asia [17, 18] . Apart from long-distance mobility, it is worth noting that both land-borne and maritime freight transport have met certain degrees of financial crisis in the phase of the pandemic; while e-commerce companies, which focus on business-to-consumer sections, such as UPS, FedEx, and Amazon, became the winner [15] . Overall, the findings indicate a notable decline in people's travel/social/shopping activities.",

Using the same dataset, Xiao et al. found that people's trip duration has notably decreased after the national call [22] . Similar evidence on the decline of travel frequency and duration was found in other regions, such as Asia and Europe [23, 24] . Besides changes in travel frequency and duration, it was observed that people tend to choose private cars or bikes rather than the subway, buses, taxis, or ride-hailing services to stay away from the gathering in many places, such as Germany, Canada, Scotland, and China [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

It was estimated that cyclists and pedestrians would enjoy a much safer trip since the pandemic has led to certain reductions in vehicle volume on roadways [35] . With e-bike accident data before and during the pandemic, we try to fill a research gap by analyzing how COVID-19 impacts e-bike safety in China. To conduct a solid empirical study, we fuse the accident dataset with public socioeconomic features that are highly correlated with traffic/ bike/e-bike safety based on the literature. For example, population and population density generally indicate the overall travel demand, and they can be positively related to the number of accidents [36, 37] , GDP and economic-related features reflect people's activity and travel frequency [36, 37] , income tends to have positive effects on car travel demand [38] , age group and gender are associated with travel mode and driving/riding behavior [39, 40] , urbanization level partially shows travel density in the study area [37, 41] .",

            "text": "The dataset used in this case study is fused based on province-level e-bike accident statistics from the Research Institute for Road Safety of Ministry of Public Security, province-level socioeconomic metrics from the China National Bureau of Statistics, and province-level COVID-19 cases data from Wikipedia (please refer to the S1 File online for the web links of the dataset). Detailed e-bike accident and socioeconomic information for all the 31 provinces and municipalities from the year 2017 to 2020 is recorded in the dataset, including the monthly number of fatalities, monthly number of injuries, monthly property damage, the distribution of accident causes, annual population, seasonal GDP, monthly electric power consumption, monthly profit from express and logistics, annual urbanization rate, average annual income, and annual age distribution. There are 1,488 data records in total for 48 months and 31 provinces/municipalities. The map of provinces is shown in Fig 2 ( Table 1 presents the statistics of variables used in this paper. Note that we are not fitting a panel data model so that the annual/monthly linear trend is not considered. Property damage is not considered in our study because the costs/prices of e-bikes are much lower than motor vehicles. The majority of statistics are summarized based on province and month except for variables \"seasonal GDP\", \"population\", \"urbanization rate\", \"average annual income\", \"percentage of age group 1\" and \"percentage of age group 2\". For 3 months in the same season, the values of GDP are identical to the seasonal GDP of the province. For instance, if the GDP for Beijing during spring 2017 is 500 billion CNY, then we set the GDP for Beijing in January, February, and March to be 500 billion CNY. It is unnecessary to divide the value by 3 (months) since we are developing linear regression models. For 12 months in the same year, the values of average income, urbanization rate, population, and age distributions are the same for specific provinces and are regarded as annual fixed effects for regressions. The total numbers of e-bike fatalities and injuries during the four years in China are 11,137 and 88,331, respectively. Generally, injuries are recorded by the police upon incident calls, but provinces may have different counting standards. For 840 out of the 1,488 data records (56.5%), the number of e-bike fatalities is less or equal to 5 per province per month; for 54 out of the records (3.6%), the number of fatalities is over 30 per province per month and such records are observed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangxi (point 10, 11, and 20 in Fig 2) ; the highest number of fatalities is 62, which happened in Jiangsu. The spatial heterogeneity of e-bike fatalities could be caused by the differences in policy supports for using e-bikes, economic levels, and people's travel preferences. The maximum number of COVID-19 cases is 59,754 (reported by Hubei province in February 2020), which is extremely larger than any other record (the second large record is 7,153 for Hubei in January 2020). To develop sound linear models that ascertain the true effect of COVID-19, we make a nonlinear transformation of the number of COVID-19 cases by ; the time series data is obtained by summing monthly numbers of fatalities and injuries across the 31 provinces/ municipalities. We also show the log-transformed total number of COVID-19 cases (i.e., log 10 \u00f0 P 31 j\u00bc1 x j t \u00fe 1\u00de, where x j t denotes the number of COVID-19 cases for province j during month t), which refers to the right vertical axis of the figures. As depicted in the figures, the numbers of fatalities and injuries show a notable yearly (i.e., 12-monthly) periodic trend; for each year, the number of fatalities/injuries researched the bottom during January and February due to cold weather and the Chinese New Year. Furthermore, the number of fatalities/injuries gradually increased from 2017 to 2019; while the outbreak of COVID-19 in January and February 2020 remarkably slowed down the increase of e-bike fatalities/injuries cases.",

The latter task utilizes clustering-based multi-output regression models, in which provinces with a similar data pattern are grouped into clusters, and regressions are conducted within each cluster; therefore, we ascertain the heterogeneity of COVID-19's impacts across different clusters.

All these variables are directly obtained from the dataset according to specific months and provinces/municipalities.",

First, we note as \u03bb 1 increases, the coefficients of more features become zero and the model tends to be simpler due to the elimination of features with a highly collinear relationship; while the goodness-of-fit (i.e., R-Squared, MAE, and RMSE) becomes worse. Second, comparing COVID-19 models with non-COVID-19 models, we observe that the goodness-of-fit notably improves after adding COVID-19 metrics into the model.

The lagged number of fatalities and lagged number of injuries are positively related to the outputs, which is consistent with the profile plot in Fig 3. The log-transformed number of COVID-19 cases has a strong negative impact on the numbers of fatalities (a coefficient of -11.77) and injuries (a coefficient of -50.85). An intuitive explanation could be that people tend to make fewer trips during the pandemic. Although there are no direct observations on e-bike travel demand, the results are consistent with findings in other modes [29, 33, 35] . Power consumption and seasonal GDP, which reflect living, social, and productivity levels, have positive influences on the numbers of fatalities and injuries [36] . Due to collinearity between socioeconomic features, we find the coefficients of express/logistics profit and percentage of age group 2 are zero (i.e., the later variable is negatively related to GDP because a higher percentage of aged people means a lower labor level). The average income has small negative coefficients, which could result from the negative relationship between income and e-bike usage (or positive relationship between income and driving/taxi demand) [47] . Given the linear relationship between socioeconomic and e-bike safety metrics, we are unclear whether unsafe riding habits are under control or not during these years [48] , so that more variables are needed to conduct further analyses. In summary, COVID-19 relieves e-bike safety issues in China, possibly due to the decline of overall living and social activities and e-bike travel demand.",

Cluster 1 contains 25 provinces/municipalities that are marked with orange dots and numbers in Fig 2; while cluster 2 contains the remaining 6 provinces (including Hubei province, one major outbreak place of COVID-19) marked with blue dots and numbers. We show distinctive features in socioeconomic, e-bike safety, and COVID-19 patterns of the two clusters in Table 3 . The ebike safety issue concerning the number of fatalities/injuries in cluster 2 is significantly serious than in cluster 1, and the variances of socioeconomic metrics in cluster 2 are smaller than in cluster 1. Furthermore, the usage of e-bikes in provinces in cluster 2 is generally high. For instance, people in Guangxi province have a large demand for e-bike travel because e-bikes are more economical than other modes concerning the relatively low economic level; Jiangsu province is the largest producer and solder for e-bikes in China. Such information can be obtained by googling the keywords. Following the clustering-based multi-output regression approach introduced in Section 4, we try different combinations of \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 and select \u03bb 1 = 0.1 and \u03bb 2 = 0 after balancing goodness-of-fit and model simplicity. The regression results are shown in Table 4 . First, the impact of (the log-transformed) number of COVID-19 cases on cluster 2 (i.e., -1.660/-21.67 for fatality/injury) is notably higher than cluster 1 (i.e., -0.012/-0.325 for fatalities/injuries). Second, we note the coefficients of population are negative for cluster 2, which is somehow different from previous traffic safety analyses based on small scale (i.e., block-based or zip code-based) populations [37] . This could be caused by the collinearity between population and urbanization rate, which also has negative coefficients for cluster 2. Meanwhile, the two variables have zero coefficients for cluster 1, indicating that e-bike safety is insensitive to rural and urban populations in provinces with a minor safety issue. Third, e-bike safety is found insensitive to the percentage of age group 2 in both clusters. According to the results in Table 2 , we know the rate of the aged population is negatively related to e-bike incidents, but the coefficients are dragged to zero with the Lasso regularization. Last, the profit from express/logistics has negative coefficients for cluster 2, this could be caused by the huge online shopping demand in these provinces (Zhejiang and Jiangsu are two giant provinces in China for online shopping) that would reduce the demand for travel as well as for e-bike.",

The fact could be caused by the decline of travel demand due to lockdown policies and the people's panic about the pandemic [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . With the progress of vaccination campaigns, people's travel demand could recover together with e-bike safety issues in the post-pandemic world. Concerning existing and upcoming safety issues, some provinces, such as Guangxi and Jiangsu, have already implemented e-bike \"safe-riding policies\" (e.g., wearing a helmet is mandatory) in middle and late 2020. Furthermore, the results in this paper could be helpful in policy implications. Our findings suggest that encouraging the express/logistics industry can be a promising way to control e-bike safety accidents. E-bike safety problems could be relieved when people get more income; alternatively, the promotion of other economical travel modes, such as car sharing, could be an effective way for reducing e-bike demand. In addition, for provinces in cluster 2, transportation agencies need to enhance safety enforcement in rural areas. ",

Based on a fused dataset with mainland China's province-level e-bike safety, economic, and COVID-19 metrics, we are particularly interested in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the numbers of e-bike fatalities and injuries in China. We first adopt multi-output regression models to ascertain how COVID-19 affects China's e-bike safety at the country level. The modeling results demonstrate that the pandemic has notably reduced e-bike fatalities and injuries. Second, we use clusteringbased multi-output regression models to capture different statistical patterns on the province level. Two clusters of provinces/municipalities are identified: one (cluster 1) with a lower while the other (cluster 2) with higher numbers of e-bike fatalities and injuries. Cluster 2 includes Hubei provinces, which is one major outbreak place of COVID-19. The regression results indicate that the pandemic has a greater negative impact on the number of e-bike fatalities/injuries for provinces in cluster 2, while the influence for provinces/municipalities in cluster 1 is negative but weaker. The regression results can be helpful in policy implications that further reduce e-bike safety issues; for instance, the government could encourage the express/logistics industry to decrease e-bike demand and e-bike accidents.",

As a result, the interplay between COVID-19 and the food (also grocery) delivery industry as well as its impact on e-bike safety are not captured in this paper. Second, the horizon of the current time-series data is short for a comprehensive understanding of how COVID-19 affects e-bike (also other roadway traffic) safety, especially in the post-pandemic world. This is because the pandemic could still coexist with people for a long time and one year's data is not sufficient to fully examine the fundamental changes in mobility and traffic safety patterns. Third, personal travel habit data is not accessible in this paper, which could be important for ascertaining the safe/unsafe driving/riding patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fourth, we haven't involved policies and interventions related to COVID-19 and (or) e-bike regulations; social events such as the \"stay-at-home call\" could have notable correlations between COVID-19 cases, e-bike travel demand, as well as the overall travel demand across different modes, which also affects the level of safety [2] .
