By enabling definition of lineages it facilitates tracking of the global spread of the virus. The evolution of new variants can be monitored and knowledge of specific mutations provides insights into the mechanisms through which the virus increases transmissibility or evades immunity. To date almost one million SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced by members of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium. To achieve similar feats in a more cost-effective and sustainable manner in future, improved high throughput virus sequencing protocols are required. We have therefore developed a miniaturized library preparation protocol with drastically reduced consumable use and costs.",

Indeed, WGS is now an established tool for monitoring many infectious diseases in both the USA [34] and Europe [35] . This increasing demand necessitates the development of more cost-effective high throughput library preparation methods. The ability of the Echo 525 liquid handler to dispense low volumes in a 384 plate format has already been exploited for high throughput low-cost RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing [36] . Although various high throughput protocols for sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported [11, 37, 38] , the use of acoustic liquid transfer enabled a greater reduction in volume in the Mini-XT protocol than many alternatives.

To facilitate high throughput whole genome sequencing of these samples and to reduce consumable use, a miniaturised version of the Nextera XT (Illumina) library preparation protocol called 'Mini-XT' was developed. A graphical overview is provided in Figure 1, with the full protocol available at https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bvntn5en. A list of reagents is provided in Supplementary File 1. We report here a total of 4,384 samples processed using the Mini-XT protocol of which 4271 (97.4%) passed COG-UK QC.
