Virus-carrying aerosols can penetrate the healthy human body and lungs, resulting in rapid transmission. For the first time, in this evidence-based article, the effects of different types of mouthwashes to reduce the viral load were investigated. Also, another aim of this essay is a reduction in viral load in patients with COVID-19 and prevention developing ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients. Methods Related databases were comprehensively searched for relevant studies. The present study was performed according to the preferred cases for standard systematic reviews (PRISMA). Results Five original studies in which the subject matter was directly evaluated were included. Different types of mouthwashes and viruses were investigated in this study. Conclusions The antiviral mouthwashes play a certainly important role in reducing the viral load of the salivary virus. In the present study, this importance could be proved in two different aspects, that is, the use of mouthwash before dental procedures to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to the dental team and the use of this mouthwash in COVID-19 patients to help improve systemic problems associated with oral microbial flora.",

Studies also show that virus shedding is very high in the early stages of the disease in the upper respiratory system [10] . Considering the role of saliva and salivary glands in the entry of COVID-19 virus into the body, the process of infection and as a source of the presence of this virus should be considered even in asymptomatic carriers [11] . Recent reports declared that the coronavirus has the potential of transmission from the asymptomatic carriers. This can be due to the incubation period ranging from 0 to 24 days and false-negative RT-PCR results in asymptomatic carriers. Also, they mentioned if more than 30% of transmission occurred by the incubation period, more than 90% of the contacts could be followed out [12, 13] . Saliva plays an important role in transmitting the infection through the spread of virusinfected droplets [11] . Aerosols are liquid or solid particles (less than 5 \u03bcm) that remain suspended in the air for long periods and they evaporate faster and widespread in the air and fall out away. There are also larger droplets (more than 5 \u03bcm) that are heavier, fall out nearby faster than they evaporate, and unable to stay suspended for long periods [14, 15] . Virus-carrying aerosols can penetrate the healthy human body and lungs through direct inhalation through the nose or mouth (COVID-19 can transport to 1 meter during normal breathing and the exhalation can diffuse COVID-19 beyond 2 meters), sneezing and coughing, or through contact with the mouth, nose, and eye mucosa, resulting in rapid transmission of the disease to people in the society [16, 17] .",
