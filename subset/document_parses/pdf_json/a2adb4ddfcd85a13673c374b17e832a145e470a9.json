            "text": "Objective To determine if caregivers of children presenting to pediatric emergency departments (EDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic are delaying presenting to care for fear of contracting COVID-19. Methods This was a pre-planned secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey study of caregivers accompanying their children aged 0-19 years to 16 pediatric EDs in 5 countries from May to June 2020. An anonymous online survey, completed by caregivers via RedCAP, included caregiver and child demographics, presenting complaints, if they delayed presentation and whether symptoms worsened during this interval, as well as caregiver concern about the child or caregiver having COVID-19 at the time of ED visit. Results Of 1543 caregivers completing the survey, 287 (18.6%) reported a delay in seeking ED care due to concerns of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital. Of those, 124 (43.2%) stated their child's symptoms worsened during the waiting interval. Caregiver relationship to child [mother] (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.27-2.76), presence of chronic illness in child (OR 1.78. 95% CI 1.14-2.79), younger age of caregiver (OR 0.965, 95% CI 0.943-0.986), and caregiver concerns about lost work during the pandemic (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12) were independently associated with a COVID-19-related delayed presentation in multivariable regression analysis. Conclusions Almost one in five caregivers reported delaying ED presentation for their ill or injured child specifically due to fear of contracting COVID-19 while in hospital, with mothers, younger caregivers, caregivers of children with chronic illness, and those concerned about lost work more likely to report delaying ED presentation.",

            "text": "Fear in the community about the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID- 19) , has been hypothesized as a cause for delayed presentation to the emergency department (ED) for children requiring acute care [1] [2] [3] [4] . This concern stems from the combination of reduced volumes of presentations to EDs and Emergency Medical Services during the pandemic [3] [4] [5] , as well as reports of increased complication rates and severity of disease for common pediatric conditions [1, 2, 6, 7] . Analysis of 18 EDs in British Columbia reported a reduction of 57% in overall visits to the children's hospital ED and 70% to 17 general hospital EDs [8] . An electronic survey completed by 2433 pediatric consultants in the United Kingdom and Ireland in April 2020 demonstrated that 32% of providers had witnessed delays in presentation [9] . In the 30 days following a national lockdown period, a US study found a significant decrease in mean daily number of pediatric ED visits accompanied by a corresponding increase in high acuity visits, and inpatient and ICU admissions compared to a historical cohort [3] .",

The study-specific items were developed by the COVID-19 Parental Attitude Study (COVIPAS) research team [10] [11] [12] . Major themes included demographics, presenting symptoms, whether ED presentation was delayed due to concern of catching COVID-19 and if symptoms worsened during this interval. We asked: \"Did you decide to come to the Emergency Department later than you thought of coming initially-because you were worried about catching COVID in the hospital?\" and, if yes, \"Did your child's condition get worse between when you first thought of going to the Emergency Department and now?\" We determined caregiver perception of the likelihood their child or themselves had COVID-19 at ED presentation on a 0-10 Likert scale. Literature related to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002-2003 helped inform questions in the survey. A group of 10 ED healthcare providers provided feedback that led to revisions. All items of the survey were then piloted by ten caregivers not included in the final analysis and their feedback informed changes needed for face validity of the survey. The survey tool was translated and available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Hebrew. Figure 1 shows the inclusion of adult caregivers of children 0-19 years presenting to participating pediatric EDs with non-COVID-related concerns between May 4th and June 30th, 2020",

Given that multiple statistical tests were performed, to protect from type 1 error, a Bonferroni correction was used, adjusting alpha to 0.005. We then used multivariable logistic regression analysis to evaluate independent predictors of delay, using all variables that showed (p < 0.2) in the univariate analysis as well as those deemed clinically plausible.

Of those, 124 (43.2%) stated symptoms worsened during the waiting interval prior to ED presentation. Trauma/injuries made up over 40.9% of study population, including musculoskeletal injuries, lacerations, burns, and head injuries. Gastrointestinal complaints including abdominal pain, vomiting, dehydration, GI bleed and IBD exacerbations, and suspected non-COVID-19-related infections (e.g., UTI, otitis media), including UTI, otitis, pharyngitis, abscess, and fever without a source, made up 12.9% and 12.5%, respectively. Table 1 describes the characteristics of patients and caregivers who delayed and did not delay presentation to the ED. In univariable regression analysis, the following variables were associated with reports of delayed presentation: presenting caregiver's relationship to child [mother] (OR2.27, 95%CI 1.6-3.3), presence of chronic illness in the child (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.23-2.46), concerns about lost work during the pandemic (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12), and age of caregiver (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95-0.99). Table 2 represents the multivariable regression for variables associated with delayed presentation. Presenting caregiver's relationship to child [mother] (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.27-2.76), presence of chronic illness in the child (OR 1.78. 95% CI 1.14-2.79), age of caregiver (OR 0.965, 95% CI 0.943-0.986), and concerns about lost work during the pandemic (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12), remained independently associated with a COVID-19-related delayed presentation in multivariable regression analysis. Figure 2 shows the rates of a. delay and b. worsening symptoms during the delayed period over time.

Of those who delayed, almost half (43%) felt their child's symptoms worsened during the waiting interval prior to ED presentation. Younger age of caregivers, when mothers were the presenting caregiver, caregivers of children with chronic illnesses, and overall fear of lost work during the pandemic were independently associated with delayed presentation. Caregivers of children with chronic illnesses in our cohort might have delayed ED presentation because of perceived or actual increased risk of their child developing severe disease from COVID-19 [15] . Additionally, caregivers of children with chronic illness may be more experienced and accustomed to caring for an unwell child at home, and feel better prepared to watch and wait before seeking emergency care. Similarly, older caregivers may have more experience weighing risk and determining appropriateness of urgent visits. In a study of 100 mothers examining predictors of decisions to seek urgent medical care for their children, delay in seeking treatment was associated with experience, with older caregivers of older children bringing children to urgent care with minimal delay [16] . Our findings also highlight the increased risk of delayed presentation for those fearing job loss during the pandemic. Fear of job loss is likely to be more prevalent among caregivers with low-paying jobs which cannot be done remotely, and among caregivers with precarious employment (part-time and informal workers) [17] [18] [19] . Policy measures enacted to protect the jobs of absent workers caring for their ill or injured children [20, 21] may fall short from easing caregiver anxiety, either because caregivers were unaware of the policies or because they remain fearful they will not truly be protected from job loss or lost wages.",

            "text": "These findings highlight a key insight from risk communication in disasters: the public perception of a threat is equally as dangerous as the threat itself [30] . Perception of risk, as noted by the Center for Disease Control, is \"tied to the degree to which persons feel alarmed or outraged\", and perceived risks to child health in particular are noted to be inherently less acceptable [24] . Garnering the trust of the public is critical in public health responses in pandemics. Risk communications is an established methodology of communicating honestly and effectively the risks associated with natural hazards and human activities [31] . Analysis of over 1000 studies worldwide by the United Kingdom's Department of Health resulted in publication of valuable risk communication strategies, including openness, transparency, demonstrating action and progress, treating people's fears seriously, framing announcements and responses to provide context, and encouraging and enabling self-responsibility [32] . Early in the pandemic, most messaging focused on social distancing, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, need for augmented testing, and staying home [33] . Less well communicated was the work hospitals were doing to keep people safe, including universal masking, frequent cleaning and disinfecting, screening at all entrances, separate waiting areas for people with and without COVID-19 symptoms, and maintaining social distancing. Effectively communicating these measures through social media, digital press kits for the news media, call centers, and virtual town halls for clinicians may help calibrate the public perception of risk [24] . Caregivers should also be made fully aware of the risks of delayed presentation for emergency conditions. Although several news articles have specifically addressed this issue [34, 35] , the message is not reaching its intended target. We found that rates of delay were not statistically different across the eight week study period, despite various efforts in the media to encourage caregivers to attend the pediatric ED when needed [36, 37] . As new virtual care models are being developed, we may have an opportunity to provide education to families regarding the relative safety to presenting to the ED when providing anticipatory guidance. Future research should examine the best implementation strategies for communicating this message to caregivers.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, the population of caregivers responding to the survey does not represent all caregivers in the sites where the study was conducted, as only a subset of families (likely < 5% of visitors to 16 pediatric EDs) filled out the survey. We also relied on caregiver possession of a smartphone/tablet/computer to complete the survey online, which may have limited some caregivers from responding. As this was an anonymous survey conducted in the absence of onsite research teams at the start of the pandemic, we relied on the accuracy of caregiver responses to the status of delay and could not correlate responses with the presence of deleterious or preventable medical outcome. Thirdly, the survey did not explore other pandemic-related barriers contributing to delays in seeking care, such as transportation, childcare, restrictions in number of caregivers allowed entry into the ED, or limited access to primary care providers. Additionally, the survey did not assess baseline patterns of delay in care-seeking or timing or duration of care avoidance. Finally, the survey did not examine caregiver perceptions around factors influencing risk of exposure. Further research should explore caregiver knowledge about risk-minimizing hospital activities, misconceptions around exposure to better guide public health messaging, as well as the association between caregiver-reported delayed presentation and patient morbidity/mortality.",

Better messaging regarding the relative safety of attending the pediatric emergency department is urgently needed. Caregivers should be aware of potential dangers of keeping ill or injured children at home. Our findings can guide hospital and public health risk communication toward younger caregivers and those with children with chronic conditions who were more likely to delay their ED presentation due to fear. Caregivers who feared job loss were also more likely to delay seeking emergent care for their children and support the need for continued policies that protect caregivers from job loss while seeking medical attention.",
