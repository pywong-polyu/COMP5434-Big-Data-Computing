Given the exponential surge in the number of cases and constraints placed on hospital resources, national health authorities implemented total or partial lockdown procedures or stay-at-home orders or advisories. Healthcare systems, hospitals and practitioners canceled or postponed most (if not all) elective and non-urgent visits, tests and procedures at once. Only essential and urgent encounters were conducted. This unprecedented operational shift happened essentially over a brief period of time (overnight?). Several healthcare leaders were calling their colleagues elsewhere asking for help and sharing ideas. However, the circumstances were unique, unparalleled for everyone and healthcare professionals had to be creative and resourceful while mitigating the risk of infection spread, promoting safety for healthcare workers and patients, and following national and local orders and infection control recommendations.",

Italian doctors, nurses, technologists, and administrators were pulled into a battle to manage the thousands of daily new cases, and hundreds needing a hospital or ICU admission. At the same time, other non-COVID-19 conditions, including cardiovascular or oncologic, continued to present, though at a much lower rate 2 or much later in the disease course.",

The highlights from that webinar stressed the importance of appropriate screening and prioritization of procedures, separation of COVID and non-COVID patients, use of face mask, hand hygiene, and physical distancing for patients and healthcare workers.
