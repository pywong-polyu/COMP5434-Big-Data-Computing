Newton and Raskin 10 studied the clinical and biochemical characteristics of 176 episodes of DKA in people with type 1 diabetes compared with 20 with type 2 diabetes. They found a greater proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes experiencing DKA were Latino-American or African-American and required a longer period of treatment to achieve ketone-free urine. Balasubramanyam et al 11 also compared 141 people with type 1 diabetes and 55 people with type 2 diabetes presenting with DKA and identified differences in ethnicities, body mass index and age of onset at presentation. These studies are small and there are currently no published studies comparing DKA in type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the UK.",

We also identified a small proportion of DKA related to SGLT2 inhibitors, in line with building evidence in this drug class, 17 18 as well as increasing contribution with time from causes such as checkpoint inhibitor cancer therapy and COVID-19 virus infection. We recently reported that in people with type 1 diabetes, those with COVID-19 presented more hyperglycemic episodes, and in those with type 2 diabetes those with COVID-19 were more likely to require intensive care support and had higher mortality rates. 19 Other studies have also identified changes in presenting characteristics of patients with DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic, most notably an increase in presentation of DKA in patients with type 2 diabetes. 20 21 Our analysis did not show any differences in serum osmolality between DKA in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We do show however that higher calculated osmolality across the cohort, driven by higher glucose, lactate and urea, indicated more severe dehydration and a longer length of hospitalization, but not longer DKA duration.

People with type 2 diabetes tend to have more comorbidities, experience macrovascular and/or microvascular complications, and have worse diabetic control compared with people with type 1 diabetes, which will add to disease burden and recovery from DKA. 14 22-25 On the other hand, those with type 2 diabetes who experience DKA may represent a more complex cohort, as studies have identified increased risk of complications, such as stroke, in this group in comparison with patients with type 2 diabetes who do not experience DKA. 26 Although our analyses did not find a significant difference in clinical parameters, multiple studies have indicated greater severity and mortality of DKA in patients with type 2 diabetes in comparison with those with type 1 diabetes. [14] [15] [16] Balasubramanyam et al 11 reported a high proportion of DKA episodes in non-Caucasian adults occur in persons with type 2 diabetes, similar to our findings. 11 These findings may be representative of the population diagnosed with these diseases, as minority ethnic groups are at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. 27 However, this may also be in part due to the fact that those who are South Asian or black are more likely to have worse diabetes control, have a genetic predisposition or to be of a lower socioeconomic and/or educational status, all factors which associate with an increased risk of DKA. [28] [29] [30] It is also increasingly recognized that non-Caucasian ethnics are more likely to be diagnosed with ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes and this may contribute to some of the DKA episodes seen. 31 Over the years, our analysis identified a reduction in DKA duration but an increase in length of hospitalization. During this time period, multiple changes to DKA management have been implemented in our hospital trust as part of an ongoing quality improvement. 32 33 These interventions have been effective at reducing DKA duration and have included development of a real-time audit tool, automatic referral to a specialist team, electronic surveillance of blood gas results, education and redesigning of local guidelines, and monthly feedback meetings. Nevertheless, an increase in length of hospitalization was seen which contradicts reports from other centers. 9 We are still not clear of the reasons for the increased median length of stay, although this has been stable for a number of years.",

Patient education among at-risk groups, particularly those of non-Caucasian ethnicity, can increase awareness of the potential of DKA as a complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Increasing awareness will prevent DKA occurrence and enable rapid identification of warning signs to reduce DKA-associated morbidity. Furthermore, although no differences were observed in management requirements, it is important to consider factors which may affect length of hospitalization in those with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, our subgroup analysis which confirmed that those with a higher serum osmolality are sicker may inform medical practice to alert front-line workers to patients who are likely to require more care.",
