The SARS-CoV-2 spread rate has increased exponentially worldwide. The first coronavirus disease case in Canada was diagnosed on 25 January 2020 [2, 3] . Nearly every country has employed a variety of infection control measures; however, the degree of control varied between countries [4] . To attain an optimal balance of public health policies, the effectiveness of public health interventions against COVID-19 needs to be evaluated [5] . As the level of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination in each community differed when public health measures were first implemented, the same policies and assumptions of compliance yielded varying levels of success in infection control. In particular, since there was no herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2, public health interventions alone were insufficient to control the pandemic in most communities [6, 7] . However, this cannot be considered direct evidence that these measures are invalid [8] .",

A similar pattern of cyclic oscillation has been observed in countries with a temperate climates where the COVID-19 pandemic is severe [9] . Other important determinants of the seasonality of viruses are host behaviour patterns (e.g. staying indoors) and host susceptibility (e.g. susceptible children attending school), which are also affected by seasonal climate changes [12] . On the other hand, outside healthcare settings, unless a severe epidemic occurs, patients with common colds or acute lower respiratory tract infections relayed to these seasonal respiratory viruses are neither quarantined nor undergo contact screening.

The starting point of the intervention for was defined as the 11 th week of 2020, for analysis. The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic overlapped with the influenza epidemic period in countries with temperate climates in the northern hemisphere, including Canada. For this reason, it is worth analysing changes in the influenza epidemic pattern. In the current study, the influenza epidemic period was determined using laboratory surveillance data, starting with the week before the threshold value of influenza test positivity (2.5%) was reached, and ending with the week after test positivity decreased below 2.5%. As for the seasonal influenza epidemic, IFV types A and B occur sequentially or simultaneously each year. In this study, the results of influenza A were used to define the duration of the seasonal influenza epidemic. The durations of exacerbation and relief in the seasonal epidemics were compared, as well as the rate of remission. Furthermore, we compared the test positivity of all tested respiratory viruses present during the inter-influenza epidemic periods with that of other years.",

Preslope is a continuous variable, coded sequentially from 1 (first data analysis) until the introduction of the intervention. \u03b3 2 represents the change in test positivity levels immediately after the intervention. Intervention is a dichotomous variable equal to 0 before the intervention and 1 after the intervention. Estimate \u03b3 3 captures the trend after the intervention. Postslope is coded as 0 up to the intervention and sequentially coded from 1 after that point. The stationarity and seasonality were evaluated by decomposing the time series data. When seasonality was confirmed, further analysis was performed at a seasonally adjusted test positivity, and generalized least squares (GLS) was performed to compare the effects of the intervention in consideration of data non-stationarity and autocorrelation. The autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) diagrams were depicted, and the autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA; p, q) model was selected, incorporating the extended sample autocorrelation function (EACF). The final model was selected as that with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) indices. We used R statistical software version 4.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) for all analyses. A p-value < 0.01 was considered statistically significant. This study was a secondary analysis of de-identified and publicly available data. For this reason, it did not require ethics committee approval. Table 3 shows the results of interrupted time series regression of the test positivity of each respiratory virus (Fig 1) . Before the public health interventions, there were no significant changes in trend among all respiratory viruses (\u03b3 1 ). After the intervention, the test positivity for RSV, PIV, MPV, COV, and IFV decreased with statistical significance (\u03b3 3 ). On the other hand, for ADV and RV/EV, the decrease was not statistically significant (Table 3 ). In regression analysis of the test positivity of overall respiratory viruses, the seasonality and trend were confirmed by decomposing the weekly time series data. Autocorrelation was confirmed by evaluating the ACF and PACF graphs of adjusted overall test positivity, which removed the influence of seasonality. The ACF slowly attenuated to zero, and the PACF decreased after 1; therefore, the AR (1) model was considered, and the ARMA (1,1), ARMA (1,2), and ARMA (2,1) models were considered in the EACF table. Among them, ARMA (1,0), which had the lowest AIC and BIC, was selected as the final model. After the intervention, the trend (\u03b3 3 ) was calculated as -0.946 (p < 0.001), and it was confirmed that the test positivity for overall respiratory viruses had decreased after the public health interventions. The detailed results of the analyses of other viruses are presented in the S1 File.",

As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is based on PCR tests, there is a risk of underestimation [22, 23] . The results of COVID-19 sero-epidemiologic surveys using antibody tests showed much higher infection rates than did those based on reported cases [24, 25] . Among communities, there is a significant difference in the availability of COVID-19 tests and indications for testing. The number of confirmed patients undergoing symptomatic examination may be subject to selection bias. In fact, there are many differences in the actual COVID-19 mortality rates among developed European countries [26] . For these reasons, assessing the effectiveness of public health measures with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is challenging and should be interpreted with care. Therefore, seasonal respiratory virus surveillance data may be used as a complementary tool to assess compliance with and the effectiveness of public health measures.",

Individual viruses exhibited sequential epidemic patterns, and the overall test positivity rate maintained a similar pattern every year. However, after applying physical distancing and preventive measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, there were large changes in the epidemic patterns of respiratory viruses. Since there was no application of additional vaccines or the introduction of new therapeutic agents for seasonal viruses, it is not unreasonable to assume that the pandemic-related interventions caused these changes. These favourable effects have been reported in previous studies, although those analyses were limited to influenza or reports of small-scale surveillance data without time-series analysis [27, 28] . Our study's advantage was in the analysis of national data of respiratory virus infections in Canada, incorporating a well-designed reporting system from local health authorities. Besides, since long-term data were available for analysis, changes in trends following public health interventions could be evaluated after appropriately excluding seasonality.",

Comparisons and analyses of quarantine measures adopted by various countries may provide better clarity. Another limitation is that changes in medical behaviour following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic might have affected the results. However, in this study, we used test positivity rather than patient numbers for analyses, thereby showing that the actual number of patients with respiratory infections decreased. Moreover, during the COVID-19 epidemic, more test results were collected than during the same period in previous years. Lastly, we analysed surveillance data from all over Canada but did not stratify the testing performance geographically to confirm a similar population density of testing across Canada. We assumed that the testing density would be identical in all the provinces since the medical staff use their discretion in testing the patients consulting at medical institutions for acute respiratory symptoms.",
