However, this evidence must be translated into action. Knowledge translation (KT) experts have highlighted the plausible mechanisms to foster the uptake of evidence. The objective of this study was to assess the extent to which structures are in place to boost uptake of evidence, in countries of the WHO African Region. Methods: Employing a cross-sectional survey, we collected data on the availability of structures to foster the uptake of evidence into policy in 35 out of the 47 member states of the WHO African Region. Data were analysed using a simple counting of the presence or absence of such structures. Results: Less than half of the countries had evidence collation and synthesis mechanisms. The lack of such mechanisms presents a missed opportunity to identify comprehensive solutions that can respond to health sector challenges. Close to 50% of the countries had KT platforms in place. However, the availability of these was in several forms, as an institution-based platform, as an annual event to disseminate evidence and as a series of conferences at the national level. In some countries, KT was mainstreamed into routine health sector performance review processes. Several challenges impacted the functionality of the KT platforms including inadequate funding and lack of dedicated personnel. Regarding dissemination of evidence, sharing reports, scientific publications and one-off presentations in meetings were the main approaches employed. Conclusion: The availability of KT platforms in the WHO African countries can be described as at best and nonexistent at the worst. The current structures, where these exist, cannot adequately foster KT. Knowledge translation platforms need to be viewed as sector-wide platforms and mainstreamed in routine health sector performance reviews and policymaking processes. Funds for their functionality must be planned for as part of the health sector budget. Dissemination of evidence needs to be viewed differently to embrace the concept of \"disseminate for impact\". Further, funding for dissemination activities needs to be planned for as part of the evidence generation plan.",

Amongst the favourable factors are the availability of high-quality, timely and contextualised evidence providing economically feasible recommendation; the Ministry of Health's (MoH) capacity to lead the KT process; the availability of institutionalised platforms for engagement between researchers and policymakers including civil society; the mechanisms to coordinate evidence generation and synthesis mainstreamed within the MoH; and the partnerships for KT (involvement of stakeholders throughout the process to improve trust and build interest including communities) [1] [2] [3] .",

In as much as this has worked well for biomedical policies, health systems and public health decisions call for additional evidence regarding affordability, political and community acceptability and implementation feasibility [1, 5] . Such evidence can be generated from systematic research, routine information systems, observation and community perceptions [6] . Evidence generated from the different perspectives on a given policy area needs to be synthesised to generate conclusions that can inform decision-making [7] . In ensuring this, evidence collation and synthesis mechanisms, as well as knowledge translation platforms (KTP), must be institutionalised in countries bringing together multiple disciplines and institutions. Evidence collation and synthesis mechanism are typically a policy-oriented process of triangulating from different pieces of evidence, for example, from routine information and monitoring systems, and research, which is pooled together to address specific policy questions-a mechanism often used in assessing health sector performance. A multidisciplinary team is usually put together to undertake the triangulation and synthesis of available evidence and produce a programme review report or health sector performance report. This mechanism is an essential pre-requisite for a functional KT platform which Kasonde and Campbell [8] defined as the medium of mutual exchange between researchers and policy actors, typically in the nature of a nationalor state-level body which nurtures the linkages amongst the communities of researchers and policymakers to create cycles of policy-informed evidence generation and evidence-informed policy design and implementation.",

These bring together policymakers, researchers and civil society to foster the uptake of the best scientific evidence in both policy development and policy implementation [9] . An evaluation conducted 7 years later showed promising results with reference to the instrumental use of evidence in programme design and policymaking, policymakers' recognition of the role of evidence and specifically asking researchers to generate evidence on topical issues [10] . However, weaknesses in dissemination were highlighted as a gap. Poor dissemination of evidence has also been highlighted by other scholars who emphasise the importance of diversified mechanisms of dissemination, mapping of the target audience and tailoring messages, the media as an effective ally and the use of simple language [11, 12] .",

Attempts to detail required structures for KT have derived mainly from published literature which focused largely on high-income countries.

Data were collected on the structures that foster knowledge translation specifically the availability of (1) an evidence collation mechanism; (2) platform for translating and communicating research to inform health policy and practice, as well as the performance of the platform and challenges faced; and (3) ways in which evidence is disseminated.",

Suboptimal functionality was reported due to the lack of dedicated personnel.

Such approaches do not offer much reach for several reasons; access to scientific publications is a challenge because of limited access to the Internet and journal that are not open access. This is compounded by the poor reading culture, which is a documented barrier [16] . The limited use of the media presents a missed opportunity given their capacity to mobilise communities to demand policy evolution [12] . There was no mention of the use of knowledge brokers and personal communication which have proven to be effective [3, 17] . Scholars emphasise the importance of effective dissemination of evidence making reference to simplified messages tailored to different audiences and employing multiple approaches [2, 3] . Amongst noted effective strategies are demand-driven approaches (where researchers respond to policy-makers demand for evidence), and these have been employed in some settings with success.",

Further, knowledge translation platforms need to be viewed as sector-wide platforms and mainstreamed in routing health sector performance review and policymaking processes. Funds for their functionality must be planned for as part of the health sector budget. Regarding the dissemination of evidence, sharing reports, scientific publications and one-off presentations in meeting approaches employed currently in the majority of countries have already been shown to have minimal impact. Dissemination of evidence needs to be viewed differently to embrace the concept of \"disseminate for impact\".
