Emergency law-making undertaken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the Australian Parliament's capacity to provide meaningful scrutiny of proposed laws, particularly identifying and addressing the impact of emergency powers on the rights of individuals. In this context, the work of parliamentary committees has become increasingly important. Special committees, such as the Senate Select Committee on COVID-19, have been set up to provide oversight and review of Australia's response to the pandemic. This article gives an early glimpse into the key features of the COVID-19 Committee and the way it may interact with other committees within the federal system to scrutinise the government's legislative response to the pandemic. It also offers some preliminary thoughts on the capacity of these committees to deliver meaningful rights scrutiny.",

At the federal level, this includes imposing travel bans to prevent Australians from leaving the country, 2 empowering the Minister for Health to 'issue any direction to any person' in order to 'prevent or control' the spread of COVID-19 in Australia 3 and authorising the Minister for Families and Social Services to change 'any qualification criteria' and 'any payment rate' for any social security payment without seeking approval from Parliament. 4 By any measure, this constitutes an extraordinary transfer of power away from the parliament towards the executive with clear impacts on individual rights. Perhaps these extraordinary powers were and will continue to be necessary. Perhaps their potential impact on the rights of citizens and on the important oversight role that parliament plays within our constitutional democracy is proportionate to the risk posed by COVID-19 to the lives, health and economic security of our community. Legislators did not pause long to contemplate those questions. These laws were passed within days, 5 sometimes hours, 6 with limited safeguards and a heavy reliance on sunset provisions some of which are dependent on the pandemic being officially called to an end.",

Many commentators and scholars 12 suggest this form of rights scrutiny is particularly weak in the face of executive dominance or politically popular legislative agendas, although research into other experiences of urgent law-making suggests that when different committees work together the rights impact of this form of parliamentary scrutiny can be significant and positive. 13 It is this capacity for different parliamentary committees (with different mandates, membership and attributes) to work together that perhaps offers the most hope when it comes to ensuring robust rights scrutiny of the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

            "text": "As Grenfell has observed, a 'spectrum' exists when it comes to parliamentary rights scrutiny in Australia, and the role parliamentary committees play in assessing and reporting on the rights impacts of proposed or existing laws or examining the extent to which law-making power is transferred into the hands of the executive. 14 At one end of the spectrum are the more sophisticated, structured and systematic approaches to legislative scrutiny found within the parliaments of the Commonwealth, Victoria, Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Queensland, where rights scrutiny conducted by parliamentary committees occurs within the context of statutory prescribed rights mandates. 15 An example of this type of 'technical scrutiny' 16 of proposed or existing legislation is the work of the federal Human Rights Committee and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Both Committees review all Bills for compliance with prescribed rights-focused 17 or rights-related 18 criteria and report to the Senate. At the other end of the spectrum are jurisdictions like Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, which lack any overarching human rights legislation and instead rely on a largely ad hoc system of parliamentary committee review that varies in sophistication and scope across these jurisdictions. 19 And in Tasmania, the Subordinate Legislation Committee has a mandate that includes scrutinising regulations to determine whether it unduly trespasses on personal rights and liberties, but its willingness to review all forms of delegated legislation (such as directives or determinations) remains uncertain, and has come into sharp focus in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. 20 In these jurisdictions, specially constituted 'select' committees are often relied upon to examine or test the policy merits behind a proposed new law and raise the alarm about any potential rights impacts or excessive transfers of power to the executive. These select committees are often granted a range of inquiry powers to engage with the public on the issues referred to them by their originating resolution, 21 but they are rarely required to undertake a detailed rights analysis of proposed legislation. Flexible in mandate, timeframe and outputs, it is this form of 'select' or 'inquiry-based' committee that has been employed to undertake the COVID-19 oversight role in a number of Australian jurisdictions. For example, special select COVID-19 Committees have been established in South Australia, 22 and the ACT 23 with broad terms of reference and wide powers to call for public submissions and request information from government. In NSW, the Legislative Council's Public Accountability Committee has been tasked with undertaking an inquiry into NSW government's management of the COVID-19 pandemic. 24 As discussed below, a Senate Select Committee on COVID-19 has also been established at the federal level.",

Five other Senators make up the Committee, including Shadow Home Affairs Minister Kristina Keneally, Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie and Australian Greens Senator Rachel Siewert. 27 A long list of other Senators can be part of the work of the COVID-19 Committee as 'participating' members 28 -an interesting feature of the Commonwealth committee system not replicated in all Australian jurisdictions.",

On the one hand, this broad mandate suggests that the Committee may be well placed to respond to the dynamic features of the government's COVID-19 response, and question and test a wide range of policy and legislative measures.

For example the Human Rights Committee has met regularly by teleconference and produced a number of detailed reports on the human rights compatibility of primary and delegated legislation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. 32 The Delegated Legislation Committee has also committed to continue to meet regularly 'to ensure that there is appropriate parliamentary oversight of all delegated legislation, particularly executive-made laws which implement COVID-19 response measures' and has published a list of all COVID-19 related delegated legislation registered on the Federal Register of Legislation. 33 The Delegated Legislation Committee has also 'sounded the alarm' on the concerning trend towards excluding key parts of the government's COVID-19 response from the scope of its scrutiny through the process of exempting certain forms of delegated legislation (such as directives or determinations) from the operation of the standard disallowance process. 34 This 'technical scrutiny' work has clearly already been useful to the submission makers to the COVID-19 Committee, with a number of written submissions 27 Other Committee members are Senators Perin Davey and Murray Watt. 28 35 and many more submissions utilising the scrutiny framework applied by these committees in their own analysis of the rightsrelated impacts of the government's response to Are parliamentary committees up to the job?",

Some factors point towards the Committee having some influence when it comes to improving the rights compliance of the laws enacted in response to COVID-19 or providing a meaningful check on executive power. For example, the broad and diverse membership of the Committee suggests that it will be well positioned to attract input from a wide range of experts, community organisations and individuals, provided it can overcome the practical challenges associated with 'online' or 'virtual' public engagement. This is no small challenge but one that could be overcome with the provision of adequate resources, including the use of senior Secretariat staff with experience in utilising innovative consultation techniques in previous committee inquiries. 48 While it is likely that the absence of any capacity to host 'face to face' public inquiries alters the optics of committee scrutiny which can be central to attracting media attention or generating external political pressure to support the work of these bodies, 49 the COVID-19 Committee has been particularly skilled at utilising social media (including Facebook and Twitter) to publicise its public hearings.",

            "text": "As noted above, the federal COVID-19 Committee also exists within a sophisticated system of parliamentary committees, a small handful of which continue to actively scrutinise the COVID-19 laws and delegated legislation. These 'technical scrutiny committees' -including the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the Delegated Legislation Committee and the Human Rights Committee -have the potential to furnish both the COVID-19 Committee and its submission makers with important, detailed information about the extent to which these laws adhere to rights principles -even if the COVID-19 Committee itself does not focus exclusively or explicitly on the rights impacts of the laws. The use of technical scrutiny reports by high profile submission makers (such as the Law Council of Australia, Australian Medical Association and the Institute of Public Affairs) to the COVID-19 Committee could prove to be an integral 'link in the chain' when it comes to drawing public and parliamentary attention to rights abrogating aspects of the government's legislative response to COVID-19, even if the COVID-19 Committee itself is not required to look in detail at each relevant law. 50 Pulling against these factors are political characteristics of Committee which appear to lack authority, at least at this early stage. The Committee's membership is heavily weighted towards the Opposition and cross bench -reflecting the debate that ensued in the Senate at the time the COVID-19 laws were passed. While some members are senior political figures (such as Senator Kristina Keneally), the political landscape is highly dynamic. 51 Although initially keen to 'not stand in the way' of the Australian government's COVID-19 response, Opposition and non-government Senators have since engaged in more nuanced political positioning on these issues. 52 Over time this could give way to a politicisation of the inquiry function of the Committee, diluting the depth of any legislative or policy analysis or skewing the overall focus of the Committee. 53 Equally, a diversifying spread of policy positions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to the identification of less rights-intrusive policy or legislative options, particularly if developed alongside expert advice or following engagement with other statutory review bodies such as the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Fair Work Commission or the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. 54 This leads to the inevitable finding that there are many unknowns that could go either way when it comes to the impact of the COVID-19 Committee. Relationships the Committee is able to forge with key government agencies (including Centrelink, the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Department of Health) and state and territory bureaucracies could be determinative of its overall success. Research into the role of the specialist Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) suggests that establishing strong relationships of trust with key agencies such as the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the AFP provides committee members with the opportunity to 'workshop' legislative and regulatory alternatives 'behind closed doors' and generate consensus views across the political divide. 55 This research also suggests that when committees work closely with executive agencies they can also have significant rights-enhancing impacts on the final shape of the law as they move to identify less rights-intrusive ways to achieve the same shared policy goals. 56 This type of trajectory could occur in the context of COVID-19 if the Committee was able to develop these close relationships with key agencies. From a practical perspective this could mean requesting secondees from key agencies to help advise the Committee's Secretariat staff or providing the Committee with 'private briefings' on key aspects of the practical implementation of the existing laws, and on legislative alternatives. Of course, this closeness with the executive could also give rise to questions about the independence and rigour of the committee as a scrutiny body -and may be resisted by members of the committee. If this occurs, the COVID-19 Committee would be highly dependent on the submissions it receives from the community and external experts, some of whom may lack a capacity or appetite for public engagement in committee processes.",

            "text": "In the COVID-19 context, a range of additional factors are likely to be in play when it comes to anticipating the overall impact of these special select committees. In particular, the fact that sitting calendars have been subject to change significantly alters both the political dynamic in which these committees operate, and the timeframes within which these committees are working. For example, by 17 April 2020, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee had issued its first Scrutiny Digest concerning the Australian government's Coronavirus Economic Response Package Omnibus Bill 2020, calling on the proponents to provide advice regarding the 'Henry VIII clauses' that empower Ministers to modify primary legislation through delegated legislation in the social security context. 57 The Scrutiny of Bills Committee also sought advice as to why 'it is necessary and appropriate to provide the minister with broad discretionary powers to alter or extend the operation of supplement payments in the Social Security Act 1991' 58 and queried the 'criteria ministers will consider before determining whether it is appropriate to defer sunsetting under the provisions of the bill'. 59 As is often the case when it comes to scrutiny of emergency law-making, this Scrutiny Digest report came weeks after the Coronavirus Economic Response Package Omnibus Bill 2020 (Cth) had been enacted into law, and too late to give rise to any direct legislative amendments. However, as research into other forms of urgent or emergency law-making shows, 60 this does not of itself render meaningless the work of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee (or other technical scrutiny committees such as the Delegated Legislation Committee or Human Rights Committee) when it comes to influence or impact on the future shape of the law. Consideration of the roles of these committees in scrutinising Australia's counter-terrorism laws, for example, shows that publicly documenting the rights-abrogating features of proposed laws can have a rights enhancing impact on future iterations of these laws, even if this comes too late for immediate amendments to be made and even when the impact is far from completely remedial from a rights perspective. 61 This is most likely to be the case if the scrutiny occurs within a broader parliament committee system where other committees -such as the COVID-19 Committee -are able to utilise these scrutiny reports as part of their broader public inquiry functions. 62 It is too early to see how all these factors will play out, or to accurately guess the impact of the Senate Select Committee on COVID-19 or other parliamentary committees within the federal system when it comes to rights scrutiny of the government's response to the pandemic. It may take years to evaluate their role and influence, particularly if regard is had to the long reporting timeframes. 63 It may be that the sceptics of Australia's 'exclusively parliamentary' model of rights protection 64 are proved right, and that without more significant structural change (such as the establishment of judicial oversight of rights-infringing laws and policies) there is little prospect of robust rights scrutiny at the federal level. However, this preliminary glimpse at the work of the COVID-19 Committee and its engagement with other scrutiny committees within the federal system suggest reasons for hope. Perhaps by working together, these committees can play an important rights-enhancing role and provide a key forum for the rights-infringing aspects of the government's COVID-19 response to be explored in a public way.
