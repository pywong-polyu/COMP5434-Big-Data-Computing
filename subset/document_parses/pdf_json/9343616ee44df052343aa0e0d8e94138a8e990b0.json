However, gaps exist in our understanding of intergenerational cycles and co-occurrence of violence, and whether patterns of violence vary by women and children's life course transitions and developmental stages. Using data from the 2015-2016 Demographic and Health Survey, we estimated structural equation models to evaluate the pathways between women's exposure to IPV perpetrated by her father against her mother (maternal abuse), her own past-year experiences of IPV, attitudes toward IPV, and household child discipline practices. We ran stratified analyses by women's age at first birth and child's age to assess whether intergenerational cycles and co-occurrence of violence in the household vary by pivotal life events and development stages. Maternal abuse was directly and indirectly associated with women's past-year exposure to physical and/or sexual IPV and children's exposure to physical or emotional child abuse by a caregiver in the household. Stratified models indicated significant intergenerational cycles of IPV and co-occurrence of IPV and child abuse among women who experienced first childbirth before age 23, and among women living with older children. We conclude that synchronized efforts to prevent violence against women and violence against children are integral to addressing cyclical and cooccurring patterns of violence in Burma (Myanmar). Violence prevention efforts might consider developmental stage and life course factors that may intensify risk of intergenerational violence.",

            "text": "Child abuse and intimate partner violence (IPV) are prevalent in the Southeast Asia region and contribute to the region's burden of disease and disability (Fang et al., 2015; Fry, McCoy, & Swales, 2012; Fulu et al., 2017) . Two-thirds of children across Asia experience some form of child abuse in the past year (Hillis et al., 2016) . In Southeast Asia, one in three ever-partnered women report physical and/or sexual IPV during their lifetime (Devries et al., 2013) . While research and interventions on child abuse and IPV tend to operate in silos, there are calls to increase research at the intersections between these two forms of violence (Guedes et al., 2016; Mercy et al., 2013) . There is some regional evidence of co-occurrence of child abuse and IPV, as well as intergenerational cycles of child abuse and IPV victimization and perpetration, although research is still lacking in many Asian countries (Fry et al., 2012; Fulu et al., 2017; United Nations Children's Fund, 2012) . However, evidence on whether co-occurrence and intergenerational cycles of violence vary based on pivotal child and maternal events and life stages is limited. Yet, children experience age-dependent risks of child abuse, and a woman's transition through key life events, such as marriage and childbirth, are central to her and her children's health and wellbeing, including risk of IPV (Administration for Children and Families, 2021; Miedema, Shwe, & Kyaw, 2016; Yount, Crandall, & Cheong, 2018; Yount et al., 2016) . In low-income settings, 1 research on developmental stage specific intersections between child abuse and IPV can help to guide practitioners and policymakers toward priority opportunities for violence prevention. In Burma (Myanmar), 2 a lower-middle income country situated between South and Southeast Asia, research on the intersections between child abuse and IPV is nascent, even while public health and development initiatives are expanding after decades of international isolation (D\u00e9cobert, 2020) .",

The 2014 census, the country's first national census in 30 years, estimated a population of nearly 54 million, with over half of the population younger than 30 (Republic of the Union of Myanmar, 2015) . After sixty years of authoritarian military rule, democratic elections in 2010 transitioned power to a quasi-civilian government. The transfer of power heralded an economic, political and social opening of this long-isolated country (U.S. Department of State, 2021b) . In 2019, Burma (Myanmar) was one of the fastest growing economies in the region (International Development Association -World Bank Group, 2021) . Still, repression and discrimination continue, particularly against minority ethnic communities, and civil conflict between the military and ethnic armed groups has contributed to internal displacement and documented civilian abuses (U.S. Department of State, 2021a) . The United Nations Development Programme 2020 Gender Equality Index ranked Burma (Myanmar) 118 out of 189 countries (United Nations Development Programme, 2020) . The current 10-year National Strategic Plan for Advancement of Women (NSPAW) 2013-2022 is the first national strategy to advance the rights and freedoms of women in Burma (Myanmar), in large part due to mobilization of the nascent women's rights movement (Mra & Livingstone, 2020) . One of NSPAW priority areas is the prevention of violence against women (Myanmar National Committee for Women's Affairs, 2013). However, to date, there is no law prohibiting IPV. The Protection and Prevention of Violence against Women (PoVAW) legislation was first drafted and proposed in 2013. As of this writing, the law is awaiting debate in parliament.",

These norms derive from local gender ideologies that accord men physical, spiritual and material superiority over women and children in society (Falb et al., 2020; Larsen, Aye, & Bjertness, 2021; Miedema et al., 2016) . These gender ideologies, referred to as hpon, evoke the spiritual protection accorded to men that confers men's higher status in Burmese (Myanmar) society (Ikeya, 2011; Nwe, 2009) . Hpon is used to justify and reinforce gender stereotypes of men's dominance and leadership, and women's inferiority and caregiving roles in the family (Nwe, 2009) . Under these conditions, women's ability to adequately care for children and maintain the household confer social standing to the family (Falb et al., 2020) . Violence may be used as a corrective tool for men to discipline women (and children) who fail to conform to social expectations around these roles. Indeed, four out of ten Burmese (Myanmar) women agree that men's use of violence against women is justified in cases when women neglect their children (43%) and 24% justify IPV if women leave the home without telling their husbands (Larsen et al., 2021) . These social norms influence women's risk of IPV. In Burma (Myanmar), women who espouse attitudes in favor of men's use of IPV are 1.4 times more likely to experience lifetime physical IPV (Tun & Ostergren, 2020) . Further, norms that justify men's use of violence against their partners are related to the co-occurrence of men's perpetration of child abuse and IPV (Namy et al., 2017) .",

Women's transition into marriage and age at first birth are significant life course events that reflect women's human and social resources. In South and Southeast Asia, age of marriage consistently predicts age of childbearing, net of demographic factors such as birth cohort or sociodemographic factors (MacQuarrie, 2016). Women who marry and give birth early (e.g. before age 18 years) may experience limited agency, status and access to resources in the household (Miedema et al., 2016; Raj, Jackson, & Dunham, 2018; Yount et al., 2018) . Women's marriage before age 18 is associated with women's increased risk of IPV (Yount et al., 2016) . In Burma (Myanmar), qualitative research finds that IPV survivors describe early marriage (and subsequently early childbearing) as a strategy to improve economic and social insecurities during adolescence, such as parental separation or household economic strain. However, the nature of these early marital transitions inhibit women's ability to mitigate risk of IPV during the course of marriage (Miedema et al., 2016) .",

While young children are at greater risk of abuse, the determinants of abuse may change as they age. Worldwide, children face increased gendered restrictions on behavior as they transition into adolescence (Blum et al., 2017) .

We anticipate that women's exposure to IPV between her parents will be positively associated with household child abuse and negatively associated with household positive child discipline practices, and that these pathways will be mediated through women's exposure to past-year IPV.

The Myanmar DHS was implemented by the Ministry of Health and Sports (MoHS) with technical support from ICF International and the DHS program. The MDHS used a two-stage sample design, stratified by regions/state (Ministry of Health and Sports &ICF, 2017). The sampling frame comprised of 76,990 primary sampling units which included 2014 census enumeration areas or non-enumerated wards or village tracts. A random sample of PSUs (clusters) were selected and then households were sampled from each cluster. The Myanmar DHS women's questionnaire was administered among a probability based, nationally-representative sample of women and included a domestic violence module, derived from the World Health Organization, which was administered among a random sub-sample of women (Garcia-- Moreno et al., 2006) . The household questionnaire was completed by the head of household or another eligible adult. Child discipline measures were included in the household questionnaire. For each household, a single child aged 2-17 years was randomly selected from the household list as the target child for all child discipline questions. If there was no child younger than 18 living in the household, the child discipline questions were omitted. In each household, women aged 15-49 years were eligible for the women's survey. The selected woman was not necessarily the mother of the target child selected for the household child discipline measures as the household survey items were administered to a mother, father, caregiver or guardian. Further, in some cases, the selected women might have been another woman living in the household, such as a daughter, cousin, aunt or other family member, or permanent household member. A total of 12,885 women completed the women's questionnaire, with a response rate of 96%. A total of 3425 ever-partnered women completed the domestic violence module. Our final analytic sample included 2751 ever-partnered women who lived with a child between the ages of 2-17 years.",

Adversity within the natal family (such as growing up experiencing their father's abuse of their mother) may invoke women to leave home via marital unions at younger ages, as a strategy to attain security and safety, even after accounting for household wealth (Raj et al., 2018) . This transition may put them at risk of entering violent relationships, or inhibit their agency and autonomy once married (Miedema et al., 2016) . The direct and indirect effects of maternal abuse on past-year IPV and household child abuse were not significant among women who gave birth later in young adulthood. These non-significant effects may be due to women's pre-marital human and social resources (e.g., greater schooling attainment), which in turn may interrupt intergenerational pathways of adversity, enhance women's agency and accord women greater protection from violence in the home (Schuster et al., 2019; Yount et al., 2016) . Further, pathways between maternal abuse, past-year IPV and household child abuse were attenuated as women aged. Structural models stratified by women's age at time of survey show similar results as those models stratified by age at first birth (results available upon request), suggesting that age-related factorssuch as greater agency or status accorded to older women in Burma (Myanmar) -may influence patterns of intergenerational and co-occurring violence in the home. Finally, pathways between maternal abuse, past-year IPV and household child abuse were significant only for older children. These results suggest that individual level factors, such as maternal abuse and past-year IPV, may be more relevant to experiences of household child abuse among older children compared to younger children. Furthermore, in Burma (Myanmar), child abuse in pre-and early adolescence, may reflect increased salience of normative gendered constraints for boys and girls (Blum et al., 2017) , and children may experience harsh parenting practices to conform to these gendered expectations. Individual-level exposure to interpersonal violence may have a greater influence on abuse during these transitional adolescent stages, compared to earlier stages of child development. Finally, older children who witness IPV between household members also may be more likely to intervene than younger children, and in turn be more likely to experience backlash violence as a result of their intervention.",

For example, effective interventions to prevent child abuse, such as early childhood home visitations, parenting skill and family relationship programs, and school enrichment and family engagement interventions, may also interrupt developmental pathways that put women and men at risk of IPV victimization and perpetration (Fortson et al., 2016; Niolon et al., 2017; World Health Organization, 2016) . Adaptation of family-centered interventions that aim to prevent multiple forms of household violence may be effective given the intergenerational and intrahousehold nature of violence in this context (Shai et al., 2020) . More research is needed on shared risk factors for child abuse and IPV in Burma (Myanmar). Notably, a global conversation is emerging on the similarities between the norms sustaining both violence against women and violence against children, such as norms that promote acceptance of violence or norms that limit intervention to interrupt family violence as it occurs (Kenny & Cislaghi, 2019) . Evolving programmatic efforts to prevent IPV and violence against children through transformative social norms change, such as community mobilization efforts and family-centered interventions, may be adaptable to the Burma (Myanmar) context (Abramsky et al., 2014; Kyegombe et al., 2015; Shai et al., 2020) . This study has several limitations. The DHS was a cross-sectional study with retrospective reports of women's knowledge of her mother's exposure to physical IPV. Underreporting of violence is more common in large mixed-topic surveys, such as the DHS, compared to surveys focused explicitly on interpersonal violence (Ellsberg et al., 2001) . In the DHS, child abuse was reported by a caregiver or adult, rather than self-report by children. This caregiver or adult was not necessarily the child's mother, and so we do not evaluate pathways to women's own reports of child abuse perpetration, but rather pathways to abusive practices toward children by a caregiver within the household. Relatedly, we did not have adequate sample size to evaluate differences between women and men's perpetration of child abuse. This limitation has implications for interpretation of results. For example, in this analysis, we were unable to distinguish whether pathways reflect patterns of abuse cycles within women (i.e., exposure to maternal abuse, own experience of IPV and subsequence child abuse perpetration by the mother/female caregiver), or whether women's experiences of IPV and household child abuse were perpetrated by the same individual (e.g., a husband/father). Alternatively, multiple perpetrators of different forms of violence may have been present in the same household and these may vary by child's age. Therefore, the significant pathways may reflect underlying environmental conditions of risk, alongside individual-level factors. Future research should investigate gendered and household patterns of child abuse perpetration in Burma (Myanmar). Finally, we found relatively small effect sizes, which indicates the importance of other predictors of child abuse and neglect and positive discipline outside of what was captured in this study. Further research is needed on the multilevel determinants of child abuse and neglect in this context.",

At the time of writing, studies on violence against women and violence against children are postponed due to civil unrest. In September 2021, the Women's League of Burma reported on the effects of the military coup on the safety and wellbeing of women and girls. Adverse effects included risk of military-perpetrated sexual violence against women and girls, gendered impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as handled by the military government, and limited safety or protections for women and girls who may experience abuse (WLB 2021) . It remains to be seen what the long-term effects of the current political crisis will be on the prevalence of household violence against women and children. Future violence prevention efforts will need to consider the compounding effects of this backdrop of community violence and human rights abuses on the intersections of child abuse and IPV in Burma (Myanmar).",
