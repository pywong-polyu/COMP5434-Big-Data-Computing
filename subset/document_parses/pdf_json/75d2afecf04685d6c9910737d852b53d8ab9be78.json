As the cost of renewable energy generation is decreasing, mainly for photovoltaic energy, a significant increase in its production is expected, in particular at the local and domestic levels. Yet, much investment and development is still needed to fulfil the goals for renewable energy generation defined by the Portuguese government and the European Union, in order to decarbonize energy generation and reduce energy dependence. Besides limitations in the installed capacity, the full potential of existing and future RES is not fulfilled, mainly due to imbalances in supply and demand, resulting from the varying climatic conditions and limited energy storage capacity. Although some investment was made in large scale Energy Storage Systems (ESS), especially pumped hydro, distributed energy storage (DES), in particular for stationary domestic storage appliances, have received little attention from decision makers. When properly defined, designed and implemented, they can contribute to increase the efficiency of existing and future RES and the capacity factor. Thus, in this work the questions regarding the implementation of DES are analysed. The main criteria that have to be considered when selecting the proper storage technology for DES are defined, taking into account information and data from current legislation and/or strategic plans and goals, and the technical and scientific literature, in order to support decision making and policy definition at different levels. The proposed application of the various criteria leads to the conclusion that for DES, electrochemical based ESS are the most adequate, among which Li ion batteries and redox flow batteries, particularly suited for local and/or household applications. The current policies sought out for Portugal are also examined in order to identify which aspects should be improved to promote and increase the relevance of DES in the Portuguese energy mix, and it is concluded that specific policies and support are needed to increase the relevance of decentralized electricity storage systems.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Modern societies require abundant quantities of energy to perform normal daily activities, such as cooking or transportation, to ensure human comfort and wellness, and to provide the products and services used by people and companies.

Key examples are the imposition of all new buildings to be NZEB (EC, 2018b) , and the efficiency measures imposed in industry, that will be much easier to reach if DES are implemented, in particular combined with RES such as PV (Gouveia et al., 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 265, "end": 276, "text": "(RCM, 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 277, "end": 288, "text": "PNEC, 2019)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 607, "end": 618, "text": "(EC, 2018b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 771, "end": 793, "text": "(Gouveia et al., 2019)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Criteria identification and evaluation"}, {"text": "Energy density and duration of storage are also important issues. Similar to the distributed RES in which they are incorporated, DES will also have variable operating conditions, depending on the availability of renewable energy for storage, and the users energy needs. Thus, it is imperative that the energy is not lost during periods of non-operation, as it will represent an economic loss and lower the DES overall efficiency. Energy density, normally defined as quantity of energy per unit volume, is also relevant, as the higher its value the smaller and lower deployment impacts are expected.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Criteria identification and evaluation"}, {"text": "The local resources should also be taken into account. Although under Portuguese conditions PV is valuable nationwide, in certain regions other forms of renewable energy may be significant, as for example wind power in the north, and geothermal energy in the Azores archipelago. Also, the local or regional capabilities of the electricity distribution network may limit the ability of DES to interchange electricity with it, reducing their overall efficiency.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Criteria identification and evaluation"}, {"text": "Several aspects have to be considered in the economic issues. First, the initial investment costs and the cost of the capital are important issues, and a suitable indicator for these is the Energy Investment Costs (IRENA, 2017) . As DES will be mostly implemented by individuals and small/medium companies, ESS that involve large initial investments are not adequate, as they normally do not have the necessary funds or access to credit. This sub criterion limits the potential technologies for DES to those that do not require large initial investments, as for example batteries. Second, a comparison between different ESS should also consider the operation and investment costs and the capital depreciation. Although a normal project evaluation analysis is suitable, an indicator that is becoming increasingly more consensual to assess the viability of a given ESS or to compare different ESS is the Levelized Cost of Storage, LCOS (Lazard, 2018; Schmidt et al., 2019; Julch, 2016; Zakeri and Syri, 2015) . This indicator represents the sell price of the energy stored to ensure that levelized costs are equal do the levelized revenues during the ESS shelf life. For both indicators, several ranges of values are available in the literature (IRENA, 2017; Lazard, 2018; Schmidt et al., 2019; Julch, 2016; Zakeri and Syri, 2015) and they could be used to compare different technologies. LCOS can be calculated from data obtained from suppliers and/or the literature. LCOS estimation depends on the assumptions made for the investment, technology and operation and on the specificities of the installation conditions. The indicator may present large differences between ranges (Lazard, 2018) . For example, considering residential PV and storage, LCOS (US$/MWh) varies between 476 and 735 for lithium batteries, between 512 and 707 for lead batteries, and between 498 and 675 for advanced lead. The reported value shows that presently, from an economic point of view, it is unclear which is the most suitable battery technology without considering other factors (IRENA, 2015 (IRENA, , 2017 Lazard, 2018) . It is expected that estimated LCOS values for batteries would reduce largely over the next few years as a result of technology development and reduction of production costs (Lazard, 2018) . This is also agrees with the goals defined by the EU in its SET -Strategic Energy Technologyplan (EC, 2016) . Moreover, the support policies may play a role in terms of subsidies or fiscal abatements, reducing the investment and operational costs of DES. This is important in poor and sparsely populated regions, as it is the case of some Portuguese regions, where households and companies may lack the capital needed to invest in ESS or DES.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 214, "end": 227, "text": "(IRENA, 2017)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 934, "end": 948, "text": "(Lazard, 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 949, "end": 970, "text": "Schmidt et al., 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 971, "end": 983, "text": "Julch, 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 984, "end": 1006, "text": "Zakeri and Syri, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1256, "text": "(IRENA, 2017;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1270, "text": "Lazard, 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1292, "text": "Schmidt et al., 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1305, "text": "Julch, 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1328, "text": "Zakeri and Syri, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1690, "text": "(Lazard, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2061, "end": 2073, "text": "(IRENA, 2015", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2074, "end": 2088, "text": "(IRENA, , 2017", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2102, "text": "Lazard, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2278, "end": 2292, "text": "(Lazard, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2402, "text": "(EC, 2016)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Criteria identification and evaluation"}, {"text": "Taking into account the various criteria and the current state of the art, electrochemical-based storage, in particular batteries, are seen as the best option for DES.

There are various available technologies that are able to fulfil the needs of different users. Thus, while the solutions already available in the market are adequate for many situations, the present strong investments in R& D, focusing for example in reducing costs and increasing the energy storage density, ensures that batteries will be increasingly seen as the most adequate choice for DES.

Storage systems may allow that the renewable energy generation fixed costs are distributed for a larger marketed production, inducing the price per kWh to fall.

There is room to improve recent national strategic plans relating to decentralized small-scale storage, to capture the opportunities and advantages that can arise from the ongoing technical developments. Yet, the incentives for promoting storage technologies in Portugal, mainly those at decentralised level, are unclear. Our research also indicated that mechanisms for payment of flexibility services inherent to the use of energy storage devices are still missing. The capacity market is lacking further studies in the economic and social perspectives that ground the institutional support for its promotion and development.
