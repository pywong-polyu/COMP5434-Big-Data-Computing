Accumulating evidence globally suggests that this is not the case for most PwMS (Loupre et al., 2020; Sormani et al., 2021; Simpson-Yap et al., 2021) . However, older age, higher disability, vascular comorbidities, and anti-CD20 therapy have been identified as risk factors associated with developing severe COVID-19 and COVID-19-related complications (Loupre et al., 2020; Sormani et al., 2021; Simpson-Yap et al., 2021) . Due to the substantial regional variability of COVID-19 prevalence, there is a continued need to evaluate COVID-19 cases in PwMS in different regions globally. Toronto has been one of the most affected areas in Canada during COVID-19 and has the largest MS clinic nationally. Accordingly, our objective was to evaluate clinical characteristics and outcomes of PwMS at the St. Michael's Hospital (SMH) MS Clinic in Toronto, Canada who developed COVID-19.",

Out of these, 57 (71.3%) resided in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Patients had a mean age of 38.2 years, 75.0% were women, and the median EDSS score was 1.5 (range 0-6.5). Most patients (86.3%) had relapsingremitting MS (RRMS). Fifty-four patients (67.5%) were treated with a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and eight patients (10.0%) received corticosteroids within one month of infection (Table 1) . Only four patients (5.0%) had received one dose of a Health Canada approved COVID-19 vaccine, and no patients were fully vaccinated at the time of COVID-19 infection. One patient was on teriflunomide and vaccinated eight days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, one patient was on dimethyl fumarate and vaccinated seven days prior to diagnosis, one patient had secondary progressive MS and was not on a DMT, and vaccinated 23 days prior to diagnosis, and one patient had completed a course of cladribine tablets three months earlier and was vaccinated 20 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Among all PwMS in our clinic, nine (11.3%) were hospitalized, and 13.0% of identified cases who were on DMT were hospitalized. Characteristics of hospitalized patients are displayed in Table 2 . The most common DMT among hospitalized patients was ocrelizumab (n = 3). Four patients (one on interferon-beta, one on teriflunomide, and two on ocrelizumab) required high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation without ICU admission, while four patients (one on glatiramer acetate, one on dimethyl fumarate, one on ocrelizumab, and one not on a DMT) did not require oxygen. One patient, a 70-year-old male with relapsing-remitting MS (EDSS 1.0) and hypertension not on a DMT, was admitted to the ICU, intubated due to respiratory failure, and subsequently died. Among those hospitalized, four patients had a comorbidity (two with hypertension, one with asthma, and one with inflammatory bowel disease) and one patient received corticosteroids within one month of infection. All of the hospitalized patients had normal white blood cell counts and absolute lymphocyte counts based on available laboratory assessments within the last six months prior to COVID-19 infection.",

Among the 7000 PwMS at the St. Michael's Hospital MS clinic, 0.8% had COVID-19 while residing in the GTA, suggesting PwMS were not disproportionately affected. However, 11.3% of identified cases were hospitalized, and 13.0% of identified cases who were on DMT were hospitalized, which are higher proportions than the 4.3% observed in the general population in the GTA (COVID-19: Epidemiological Summary of Cases -City of Toronto). These findings suggest that although PwMS at our center may not have had a higher risk of COVID-19 acquisition, which is typically mediated by occupational risk, those infected may have had a higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization, possibly related to specific DMT use (Sundaram et al., 2021) .",

In addition, in the early stages of the pandemic, COVID-19 testing was not as widely available, therefore early cases were likely not captured. Moreover, patients who contracted COVID-19 after their annual clinic visit were also likely missed. All of these factors likely resulted in selection bias and clinical characteristics of those not captured may differ. Despite this limitation, since most PwMS in our clinic are seen at least annually and were likely evaluated at least once during the study period, it is expected that most COVID-19 cases, and in particular, hospitalized cases were identified and captured.",

Specifically, of those treated with DMTs, one-third were being treated with ocrelizumab, further supporting the association between anti-CD20 agents and COVID-19 disease severity. Our findings add to accumulating global data regarding COVID-19 risk in PwMS and highlight the regional variability of COVID-19 prevalence, as well as the importance of contextualizing risk at a regional level to optimize the management of patients with MS. Future studies evaluating COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in PwMS on various DMTs will be important to better inform clinical care and management during the current pandemic, as well as for future viral pathogens.
