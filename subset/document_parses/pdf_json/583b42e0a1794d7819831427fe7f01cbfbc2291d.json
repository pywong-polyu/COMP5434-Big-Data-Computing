Brazil's social, health and economic crises are aggravated by strong societal inequities and persisting political disarray. This complex scenario motivates careful study of the clinical, socioeconomic, demographic and structural factors contributing to increased risk of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil specifically. Methods We consider the Brazilian SIVEP-Gripe catalog, a very rich respiratory infection dataset which allows us to estimate the importance of several non-laboratorial and socio-geographic factors on COVID-19 mortality. We analyze the catalog using machine learning algorithms to account for likely complex interdependence between metrics. Findings The XGBoost algorithm achieved excellent performance, producing an AUC-ROC of 0.813 (95%CI 0.810-0.817), and outperforming logistic regression. Using our model we found that, in Brazil, socioeconomic, geographical and structural factors are more important than individual comorbidities. Particularly important factors were: The state of residence and its development index; the distance to the hospital (especially for rural and less developed areas); the level of education; hospital funding model and strain. Ethnicity is also confirmed to be more important than comorbidities but less than the aforementioned factors. Interpretation Socioeconomic and structural factors are as important as biological factors in determining the outcome of COVID-19. This has important consequences for policy making, especially on vaccination/non-pharmacological preventative measures, hospital management and healthcare network organization.",

Age is now well established as the dominant determinant of mortality. 4 We have previously demonstrated the important effect of ethnicity and socioeconomic status in determining outcome in Brazil. 2 A number of institutional and organizational effects may also be important. It has been shown that treatment site seems to have a substantial association with mortality comparable to the effect of co-morbidity, at least for intensive care outcomes. 5 This suggests that institutional and organizational factors may be important. This is reasonable as it is likely that different hospitals may vary in their ability to respond to a surge in cases either because they are locally overwhelmed, experience an early influx of patients before surge capacity can be put into place or because they are inherently less able to expand capacity. A limited number of studies have attempted to look at this. A recent study in the United States did find evidence to support an association between hospital strain and increased mortality 6 for critical care patients, but not ward patients, and that this relationship changed over time. A similar negative impact of intensive care capacity was seen in Belgium. 7 A full understanding of the interplay between patient and healthcare system factors is crucial for rational, dynamic allocation of hospital resources as well as the targeting of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Healthcare systems vary substantially around the world, making local evaluation important. To our knowledge, this has not previously been undertaken in Brazil. Healthcare organizational factors are likely to be, to some extent, co-linear with other socioeconomic predictors and their effects may be non-linear: The extent to which organizational effects are real or the result of a failure to completely adjust for other factors in a linear model is not known. This observation motivates the use of explainable machine learning models able to deal with complex interactions and nonlinear relationships.",

We show that, accounting for age (and therefore accounting for the dominant clinical determinant), mortality probability distributions are differently skewed favoring survival in privately funded hospitals in richer areas, particularly for younger patients. Additionally we show that structural factors such as distance to hospital and an index of hospital strain are as important as comorbidities. Implications of all the available evidence Our research shows that mortality is highest in poorer, rural areas where hospital are distant or are overwhelmed. This may have important policy implications in rational configuration of both surge capacity as well as other pharmacological or non-pharmacological measures where this is not possible. In this study, we use the Brazilian SIVEP-Gripe respiratory infection surveillance dataset 8 to study demographic, patient, socioeconomic and organizational structure influences on COVID-19 outcome. As depicted in Figure 1 , we model the linear and nonlinear correlations among the covariates using the successful XGBoost machine learning technique. We name 'XCOVID-BR' the XGBoost model that achieves the highest performance. The goal of this work is to provide the scientific community and, in particular, the Brazilian authorities with a ranking of the most important social, health and economic risk factors.",

In order to capture the time-varying pressure on individual hospitals, we defined 'hospital strain' as the number of hospitalized patients during the admission week divided by a metric of hospital capacity. As capacity numbers data were not available for all the hospitals considered, we used as a proxy the total number of hospitalizations according to the 2019 SIVEP-Gripe dataset. The 231,112 patients that we consider come from 1,801 different cities and from 3,991 different hospitals.

We highlight the following factors: the state of residence and its development index, the distance to the hospital (very important for rural and less developed areas), the level of education, and hospital funding and strain.

Poor literacy is likely to also impact negatively on healthcare access. These findings support the conclusion that socioeconomic, ethnic and geographical factors are crucial in order to correctly understand the pandemic in Brazil and plan adequate measures. 12 We tested the predictive performance of the XCOVID-BR model for various sub-groups and found that the performance is generally similar to the global one, except for a few cases such as the North macro-region, illiterate Brazilians and some groups with comorbidities. The lower performance relative to these sub-groups indicates that it is more difficult to forecast the evolution of the disease within certain sections of Brazilian society, possibly because of higher heterogeneity within these sec-.

This difference is more pronounced in the North and Northeast regions, with 0.9 and 1.5 beds per 10 thousand inhabitants in public hospitals against 4.7 and 5.5 beds per 10 thousand inhabitants for private hospitals, respectively. 14 Complementary to a hospital's funding is its level of strain.
