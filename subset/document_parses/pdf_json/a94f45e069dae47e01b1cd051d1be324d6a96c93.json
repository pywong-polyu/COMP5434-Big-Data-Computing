As shown in Fig. 4A , there was no significant relationship between FC and SC in COVID-19 groups with or without GI symptoms. It was also found that FC and SC were not associated with COVID-19 patients presenting with and without diarrhea (Fig. 4B) . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ We next determined whether FC is related to commonly available laboratory parameters. In particular, potential correlations with the absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, NLR, IL-6, CRP, and ESR were assessed. As seen in Fig. 4C -H, there was no significant relationship between FC level and other parameters in the whole study population. Similar results were observed in the same analysis in COVID-19 patients with and without GI symptoms (Data not shown). patients stratified by disease severity showed that FC and SC levels were highest in moderate (254 \u00b5g/g and 4430 ng/mL, respectively) and severe (128 \u00b5g/g and 5500 ng/mL, respectively) form of the disease. As illustrated in Fig. 5A ,B, FC and SC concentrations were significantly different among control and severity stratifications (Kruskal-Wallis test). This analysis suggested that raised FC and SC among these patients may be the feature of severe disease. To confirm this possibility, we next assessed the correlation between FC or SC and disease severity. A striking positive association was found for SC (P < 0.0001), but a less robust association was appreciated for FC (P < 0.029) (Fig. 5C,D) . The length of hospitalization and mortality are considered as the criteria for illness severity 19 . No correlation between FC and length of hospital stay was observed, and conversely for SC (Fig. 5E ). Analysis of FC or SC revealed no relationship with discharge or death described as disease outcome (P = 0.415 and P = 0.076, respectively). Furthermore, considering the presence of GI symptoms, there was no significant relationship between FC or SC and diarrhea severity (P = 0.825 and P = 0.382, respectively), nor in the presence of diarrhea (P = 0.985 and P = 0.698, respectively) (Data not shown). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ ROC curve was performed to further evaluate the clinical utility of studied markers and determine the optimum cut-off point for differentiation between COVID-19 patients and control individuals. We found that the biggest area under the ROC curve (AUC) belonged to SC (0.842, 95% CI 0.753-0.932, P = 0.000) and FC (0.823, 95% CI 0.709-0.936, P = 0.000) as compared with the other markers which had slightly lower AUCs; CRP (0.803, 95% CI 0.613-0.994, P = 0.001) (NLR and ESR with lower AUCs were not shown) (Fig. 5F ). Patients with low or high levels were characterized according to the concentrations of FC at a cut-off of > 58.38 \u00b5g/g with a sensitivity of 73.1% and a specificity of 73.3%. The cut-off points were calculated for SC at 1950 ng/mL (sensitivity 81.0% and specificity 60%), and CRP at 7.150 mg/dL (sensitivity 92.2% and specificity 72.7%).",

            "text": "This prospective study is presenting the first evidence of simultaneous FC and SC level in COVID-19 patients. FC and SC were increased robustly in COVID-19 patients compared with the control group, with higher levels in severe subjects. Elevated levels of FC may indicate GI tract inflammation in COVID-19 cases, but no significant difference was observed in the presence of GI symptoms. Also, the higher NLR, CRP, ESR, LDH as well as SC concentrations in COVID-19 patients reflect the systemic immune-inflammation as a part of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite the coincidence of diarrhea or other GI symptoms and FC raising, these responses could not prove GI cells inflammation, given that none of above-mentioned inflammatory markers were notably elevated in patients with GI symptoms. Across our study, the main GI symptom presented in 26/70 (37.1%) of COVID-19 patients was diarrhea; consistent with the previous studies in which diarrhea was a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 20 . Viral RNA detection in gastrointestinal epithelium and feces from COVID-19 patients who presented with diarrhea supports gut infectivity and incidence of diarrhea 8, 21, 22 . In this regard, Effenberger et al. reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the gut inflammatory response, as evidenced by diarrhea and elevated FC. However, a very high FC characterized during acute diarrhea was not accompanied with viral RNA detection in feces 23 . In contrast, our result, similar to Britton et al. 8 , showed that FC had no relation to diarrhea, so that FC was not higher in COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. Also, FC didn't associate even with diarrhea condition and its elevation was not significant in those who had active diarrhea compared to those with stopped form. Two possibilities were proposed here: first, diarrhea was not caused by inflammation which is secondary to enterocyte invasion and destruction. Second, FC elevation was not due to GI inflammation. There is little histological evidence of apparent intestinal inflammation to support GI inflammation 24 . According to our data, the lack of FC correlation with diarrhea may be attributed to diarrhea resulting from a non-inflammatory mechanism, which is mostly caused by viral etiology 25 . Moreover, no fecal leukocytes were found among our diarrheal patients, which was consistent with viral diarrhea characteristics and non-inflammatory nature 25 . Thus, it can be noted that diarrhea does not necessarily coincide with FC raising.",

Though our study similar to some others 8, 15, 23 found an increase in FC, however, this is one of the first to demonstrate that high FC levels correlate with COVID-19 disease. It seems FC has a good discrimination capacity, as assessed by the analysis of the AUC of ROC curve for COVID-19 diagnosis and severity prognosis, similar to SC but numerically lower than it. Indeed, FC and SC both are valuable prognostic markers, as disease progression is marked by FC and SC increases. In our theory, if FC or SC elevation had been associated with GI symptoms, SC could be suggested as a strong biomarker for assessing GI inflammation in COVID-19 infection by the following reasons: SC had the highest predictive value for COVID-19, FC and SC had the same correlation with the extent and prognosis of IBD 13 , in accordance with COVID-19 disease found here. Anyway, we hope to have contributed to the development of future studies. This report has some limitations. The sample size was relatively small, though the patients were from two centers. However, multicenter research might be a disadvantage since the heterogeneity might be amongst different laboratory centers. Albeit, biomarkers of interest such as FC, SC, IL-6 were examined through a specially experienced team. In addition, FC and SC were measured only once at the acute phase of the disease, however, another sampling after remission might present exclusive data.",
