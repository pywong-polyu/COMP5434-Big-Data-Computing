            "text": "In order to plan and execute proper preventative measures against COVID-19, we need to understand how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted. It has been shown to remain infectious on surfaces from hours to days depending on surface type and environmental factors. e possibility of transmission through fur animals and contaminated pelts, along with the safety of those working with them, is a major concern. SARS-CoV-2 can infect minks and raccoon dogs and has spread to mink farms in numerous countries. Here, we studied the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on blue fox, Finn raccoon, and American mink pelt, fake fur, cotton, plastic, faux leather, and polyester and tested its inactivation by UV light and heat treatment. We detected infectious virus up to 5 days on plastic, up to 1 day on fake fur, less than a day on cotton, polyester, and faux leather, and even 10 days on mink fur. UV light failed to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 on pelts, most likely due to the mechanical protection by the fur. Hence, it should not be used to inactivate the virus on fur products, and its use for other surfaces should also be considered carefully. Heat treatment at 60\u00b0C for 1 h inactivated the virus on all surfaces and is a promising method to be applied in practice. is study helps prevent further spread of COVID-19 by increasing our understanding about risks of SARS-CoV-2 spread through contaminated clothing materials and giving important information needed to improve safety of those working in the production line as well as people using the products.",

Based on studies about SARS-CoV-2 infectivity on surfaces performed in laboratory settings, stability on surfaces can vary from hours to days. It has stayed infectious for several days on plastic, steel, and outer layer of surgical mask, but only from some hours to a couple of days on paper, wood, and cloth [4] [5] [6] . Environmental conditions like temperature and humidity have also been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, and the virus is inactivated faster in higher temperature and humidity [4, 5] . In studies performed with other coronaviruses, results have also varied depending on the surface, environmental conditions, and the virus. On plastic, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and HCoV-229E lost their infectivity within 72 hours, whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) stayed viable from three days to over two weeks [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

            "text": "Heat treatment Advances in Virology on plastic has varied between 3 and 7 days [4, 6] , we found infectious virus from plastic for up to 5 days. We were unable to culture the virus from cotton even right after drying the virus onto the surface, which is also consistent with other studies stating that SARS-CoV-2 is more stable on smooth materials [4] . In addition to cotton, this was also observed with other absorbent materials like polyester, faux leather, and skin side of pelts from which infectious virus could not be cultured after the first day. Similar pattern about infectivity on cotton has earlier been detected with SARS-CoV-1 that, according to Lai et al., loses its infectivity faster on cotton gown than on disposable gown [17] . It is unclear whether the virus is inactivated or if it just does not detach from the fabric during the sampling, but if the virus is not caught by intense swapping, it is most likely not easily caught by, e.g., human fingers either. ese results indicate that the risk of getting SARS-CoV-2 from contaminated cotton is small. It also supports the use of cotton, e.g., in reusable cloth masks, even though more thorough studies about different mask materials are needed. According to our results, risk of transmission through contaminated polyester or faux leather is also small compared to plastic but not nonexistent as infectious virus was detected in the first time point (after 30 min) and several people might be in contact with a material during that time. Interestingly, the virus could be cultured from mink fur even after 10 days in the second experiment. Since we did not have any time points beyond that, some virus particles might have stayed infectious even longer. In the first experiment, infectious virus could not be found after 7 days making the time of infectivity between 3 and 6 days. e difference is probably due to the differences in experimental conditions like trimming the furs before treatment and fluctuating humidity in the room. Since checking the virus titers would not have been reliable in this setup due to the physical loss of virus into the fur or fabric, we do not know how fast the virus titer decreased during the experiment, but as CPE was always clearly detected after two or three days, the virus amount was sufficient to cause a strong infection in cells. It is not clear if the better stability on fur can be explained by, e.g., mechanical protection by the fur or the biological properties of the fur. As stability on fake fur was significantly decreased compared to the animal fur, biological properties and substances of the animal fur seem a more likely explanation than mechanical protection. On the skin side, however, the stability was not increased, but it might be that the virus was absorbed into skin and could not be swapped. Viral loads in real-life situations can be difficult to imitate as they vary a lot: viral loads in respiratory specimens have been reported to range from almost nothing to even 10 11 copies/ml with PCR [18, 19] .",
