Determining which patients are at high risk of severe illness or mortality is essential for appropriate clinical decision making. We propose a novel severity score specifically for COVID-19 to help predict disease severity and mortality. 4711 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. We derived a risk model using the first half of the cohort (n = 2355 patients) by logistic regression and bootstrapping methods. The discriminative power of the risk model was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). The severity score was validated in a second half of 2356 patients. Mortality incidence was 26.4% in the derivation cohort and 22.4% in the validation cohort. A COVID-19 severity score ranging from 0 to 10, consisting of age, oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, blood urea nitrogen, C-Reactive protein, and the international normalized ratio was developed. A ROC curve analysis was performed in the derivation cohort achieved an AUC of 0.824 (95% CI 0.814-0.851) and an AUC of 0.798 (95% CI 0.789-0.818) in the validation cohort. Furthermore, based on the risk categorization the probability of mortality was 11.8%, 39% and 78% for patient with low (0-3), moderate (4-6) and high (7-10) COVID-19 severity score. This developed and validated novel COVID-19 severity score will aid physicians in predicting mortality during surge periods. open Baseline characteristics Derivation cohort (n = 2355) Validation cohort (n = 2356) Age-years, mean (SD) 65.3 (15.9) 61.4 (17.2) Female sex, n (%) 1256 (53.3) 944 (40.1) White, n (%) 269 (11.4) 197 (8.4) African American, n (%) 1011 (42.9) 732 (31.1) Hispanic, n (%) 837 (35.5) 916 (38.9) Asian, n (%) 44 (1.9) 77 (3.3) Body mass index (kg/m 2 ) (IQR) 28.9 (24.8-33.8) 28.1 (24.3-32.3) Diabetes simple, n (%) 442 (18.8) 244 (10.4) Diabetes complicated, n (%) 323 (13.7) 172 (7.3) Congestive heart failure, n (%) 357 (15.2) 184 (7.8) Myocardial infarction, n (%) 137 (5.8) 64 (2.7) Chronic pulmonary disease, n (%) 181 (7.7) 84 (3.6) Temperature (\u00b0C), (IQR) 37.1 (36.7-37.7) 37.1 (36.7-37.7) Oxygen saturation (%), (IQR) 95 (90-98) 95 (90-98) Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)-mmHg, (IQR) 86.7 (75.7-95.3) 86.7 (76-96.7)",

Calibration of the risk score reflecting the link between predicted and observed risk, was evaluated by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test.

Due to the large number of missing data for procalcitonin (44%), this variable was excluded in order to avoid noise predictors. Allocation of points for the COVID-19 severity score was made based on Beta coefficients and BCa 95%CI, however for the simplicity of the score we allocated points 1 to 3 in subcategorized variables (Age & MAP) ( Table 4 ). The total prediction score ranges between 0 and 10 with a high score indicating high risk of in-hospital mortality.",

            "text": "We propose a novel scoring system to aid in the prediction of inpatient mortality for patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection to hospital emergency rooms. The score is based on simple pragmatic demographic data, and presenting biomarker values. This score incorporates the unique constellation of various presentations in which COVID-19 can manifest in severe illness. We avoided incorporating mechanical ventilation use into the score as this was tied to a clinical decision, which over time with more knowledge an approach that changed. While IL-6 also seems to predict mortality, we avoided incorporating this biomarker, as it is a non-routine test, and were not available in a large percentage of our patient population. As of yet there are no scoring systems created that are specific to the elements of COVID-19 illness manifestations and that can predict mortality. The limitations of this study are its retrospective design, its cohort, which is primarily a minority urban population, and the epoch at which the data was required. Since the data and outcomes were recorded during the highest surge of the pandemic this may bias the results towards higher mortality as this was a great strain on treating hospitals at the time. Prior reports also have shown increased mortality in racial and ethnic minority patients 17 . Given the sociodemographic background of our patient population the score may again be biased towards higher mortality risk. While the design of the study may limit its generalizability to other populations, these findings are meaningful in that they are specifically applicable to minority urban centers that are suffering from large surge populations of infected patients, which in the first wave of the pandemic across the United States of America suffered the most. The encountered mortality rate is certainly high, but most likely the result of the high comorbidity burden in our population, the fact that all of these patients had enough symptom severity to warrant admission, and the fact that the study period was early in the pandemic when there was limited understanding regarding the disease. Nonetheless, given the diverse patient population of the Bronx, it is possible that this score can be generalized to other large inner-city populations. Future research is needed to validate this score in other populations, as well as to compare this score to the SOFA and ISTH DICS score. The health network from which this data was captured is comprised of a network of 3 major hospitals in the Bronx in New York City, one of which is a large quaternary care facility accepting transfers for complex and severely ill patients in the region beyond the Bronx into Westchester County. The mortality rates reported here are for hospitalized patients who tended to be older and more severely affected than others infected with the virus. Hence the mortality rate for hospitalized patients is higher than the more commonly reported case-fatality rate that reflects the number of deaths per documented infection. In any case, the rates reported here are broadly comparable to mortality rates for hospitalized patients in other countries at comparable time points in their respective pandemic outbreaks: China-48% 4 , Italy-26% 18 , and New York-21% 19 .",

            "text": "The mortality rates were slightly different between the training set (26.4%) and the testing set (22.4%). This is likely secondary to the temporal difference between the sets. During the first 3 weeks of the pandemic surge, there was still little known about optimal management strategies for severely ill patients. As time went on, mortality rates decreased. In addition, there was more community awareness of the potential impact of the virus and it is possible patients were more likely to seek medical attention sooner and arrived in less severe states. Despite this mortality rate differences, the severity score itself remained valid. There were also variances in racial distribution between the two cohorts. Despite these differences in race, the severity score remained valid in predicting in-hospital mortality. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In other metropolitan areas outside of New York City there have been reports of racial disparity and outcome, we found no difference in mortality rates between races 17, 20 . There are a number of possibilities why. The Bronx is uniquely diverse in its racial and ethnic populations however also one of the poorest regions in the United States of America with median income of $38,085 and 27.3% of persons living in poverty 21 . One reason could be that other social determinants of health, including poverty level are more powerful predictors of mortality rather than race alone.",
