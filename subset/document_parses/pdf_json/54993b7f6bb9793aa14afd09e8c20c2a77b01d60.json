[1] During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have often observed Intensive Care Units (ICU) overcrowded with patients in prone position. [2] COVID-19 patients often require intravenous administration of several drugs and vasopressors; therefore, they require the placement of a central venous line. In a patient in prone position, the Internal Jugular Vein (IJV) is the only feasible venous access for ultrasound-guided placement of a Central Venous Catheter (CVC). The existing literature dealing with the insertion of a CVC in the patient in prone position is scarce, [3, 4] and it reports few cases in the perioperative and ICU settings. In some of these reports, the placement of central venous lines in patients in prone position is even described by the authors as a last resort.",

Prior attempts to switch to supine position, precipitated severe hypoxemia (peripheral oxygen saturation less than 50%) and hemodynamic instability (hypotension and dysrhythmias). Patient 3 even presented a peri-arrest period, with extreme bradycardia associated with severe hypotension.
