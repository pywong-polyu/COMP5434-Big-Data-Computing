The emergence of the Barab\u00e1si-Albert network has led to rapid progress in the study of complex networks across many fields. The importance of the network structure in the analysis of epidemics was emphasized, and studies in several directions have been done [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . In connection with COVID-19, stochastic simulations of the epidemic model have been performed 22, 23 . The existence of absorbing states is one of the vital non-equilibrium processes on the complex network. Once the state has fallen into an absorbing state, the dynamics cannot escape from it [24] [25] [26] . The non-equilibrium absorbing phase transition is related to the directed percolation 27 . In epidemic spreading processes 6 , a fully healthy state can be regarded as an absorbing state in this sense. The contact process 28 and the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model 29 are often used to describe epidemic dynamics. It is well known that the SIS model can be mapped onto the logistic equation. In the epidemic scenario of the SIS model, individuals can be infected or susceptible. A phase transition between a disease-free (absorbing) phase and an active stationary phase is separated by an epidemic threshold. In the latter phase, a fraction of the population is infected. In the framework of the SIS model, the absence of an epidemic threshold was discussed for the spreading of infections on scale-free networks 15 .",

To perform the simulation of the microscopic model for the spread of infection, we choose the probability p of infection as p = 9/200 , which leads to \u03b2 = \ufffdk\ufffdp = 0.36 in terms of a rate constant of the SIR model, which will be explained in \"Differential equation of SIR model\" section of Methods. The average infected period, 1/\u03b3 , is chosen as 5.0 days, which is realized by a Poisson distribution with an average value of 5.0.

            "text": "As a reference system, we deal with the case where there are no variants. The initial condition ( t = 0 ) is that 10 randomly selected individuals are infected. The time evolution of the number of individuals of the three types (S, I, and R) is shown in Fig. 1 . We performed simulations for 100 samples, and the time evolution of all samples are plotted in Fig. 1a . We observe a variation in the time evolution for each sample. On the other hand, Fig. 1b is an average plot of 100 samples. The number of infected individuals (I) increases with time, reaches a peak, and gradually decreases, which is the same behavior as that for the SIR model of the differential equation. The microscopic SIR model on a random network is considered to reproduce the macroscopic SIR model almost quantitatively. The final value of the total number of infected individuals ( R(\u221e) ) is 0.732 from Eq. 34 , in the case of R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3 = 1.8 , and the measured value for the present microscopic model on the ER network is about 0.77. As a related argument, the final size was discussed in the framework of a stochastic epidemic model 35 . In the Reed-Frost model 36, 37 , which is a typical example of a stochastic epidemic model, the final size can be treated analytically. Britton et al. discussed the final size of stochastic epidemic models on networks 38 . In the previous study 30 , for a small number of initially infected individuals, some examples showed the behavior such that the infection vanishes quickly and does not spread throughout the network. This behavior is regarded as the absorbing state [24] [25] [26] in the contact process 28 . We chose 10 initially infected cases to avoid the situation of the absorbing state. We next consider the effects of variants. Suppose that 10 susceptible individuals are infected with the variant due to external factors at t = 21 . We choose 10 individuals randomly among the non-infected. The variant is assumed to be 3.0 times more infectious with \u03b2 \u2032 = 1.08 , and the average infection period is chosen as the same value as that of the original virus, 1/\u03b3 \u2032 = 5.0 . Then, the basic reproduction number of the variant becomes R \u2032 0 = 5.4 . The situation at t = 21 is that about 900 individuals are infected, 500 individuals are recovered, and 8600 individuals are not infected. In To summarize what we have shown in this subsection, we can say the following. When the number of infected individuals reaches about 900 (the total number is 10,000), a small number of individuals infected with the variant are added. If the variant is highly infectious, it will spread to the wide space from the 10 additional infected individuals. By systematically examining the variants whose basic reproduction numbers are 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, and 3.0 times that of the original species, we showed that the infection increases non-linearly with the basic reproduction number. The lack of infection to spread in the case of variants whose infectivity is not much different from that of the original species is due to the dynamic effect of infection, that is, the absorbing state.",

The situation at t = 10 is that about 620 individuals are infected, 100 individuals are recovered, and 9280 individuals are not infected.

In the middle of a simulation of infectious disease on the network, we added a variant that is more transmissible than the original lineage. When a highly infectious variant is added, the variant spreads quickly. It is noteworthy that the rate of spread is not linear in the infectivity of the variant but it is non-linear. If a variant is slightly more transmissible than the original lineage, the virus does not spread widely. It is related to a non-equilibrium phase transition of the epidemic dynamics on the complex network between a disease-free (absorbing) state and an active stationary phase [24] [25] [26] . This cannot be accounted for by the compartmental model of epidemiology. We performed simulations both on the ER model, a random network, and the BA model, a scalefree network. It was shown that the existence of the hub for a scale-free network stimulates the rapid increase of the infection 30 . But the effect of the variants for the BA network is essentially similar to the case of the ER network. It should also be noted that there is a lot of fluctuation in the spread of the more infectious variants. The greater fluctuation is due to the network structure. In summary, the reason why the more infectious variants spread, while the less infectious variants do not, has been clarified.",

The spread of a slightly more infectious variant is not significant. Variants that are more infectious than the original lineage will spread the infection in a non-linear fashion. Of course, whether or not the variant is severe is an important factor. It can be said that the major role of overseas quarantine is to identify variants. For highly infectious variants, it is necessary to identify them by genetic testing and to isolate infected individuals. To conduct special contact tracing is of particular importance in the case that they spread throughout the city. Those variants must be monitored more carefully. Measures need to be taken to control the spread of the virus and its variants. Travel restrictions can be effective in reducing the spread of the virus. Contact with people over long distances is associated with the presence of hubs in the network. As shown in the previous paper 30 , isolation of hub sites can lead to transmission control. This is also the case for variants, for which travel restrictions are effective. However, to ultimately control the epidemic, it may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out. ",

As can be seen fromFig. 4, in this case, the variant infection does not spread for all 100 samples. The spread of the additional variant is regarded as in the absorbing state. The addition of 10 infected individuals with the variant to 900 infected individuals will have little effect. We have shown that when the infectivity of the variant is strong, even if a small number of individuals are infected, it leads to the spread of the infection. On the other hand, when the infectivity of the variant is comparable to that of an original virus, it does not spread, and this is a dynamic effect. So what happens when the infectivity is intermediate? The results of measurements for intermediate values of the basic reproduction number of variants are shown in the supplementary information.

The dependence of the final number of infected on the basic reproduction number R \u2032 0 of the variant is plotted in Fig. 5. The number of infected individuals of the variant is shown by the dashed blue line and the number of infected individuals of the original species by the solid blue line. The standard deviation of the 100 samples is indicated by the error bars. The infectivity of the variant is the same as that of the original virus for R \u2032 0 = 1.8 . It can be seen that the number of infected individuals of the variant increases with the infectivity and the fluctuation also increases. The increase is not linear; that is, when the infectivity becomes slightly larger, the spread of infection is small, but as the infectivity further increases, the increase is non-linear. On the other hand, the number of the infected individuals with the original species decreases slightly. This is because individuals who would have been infected with the original species if there had been no new infections of the variant will be infected with the variant. The sum of the infected individuals with the variant and those with the original species is shown by the red line, and the sum increases. However, the fluctuation of the sum is not necessarily large.

The results of measurements for various R \u2032 0 of the variant on the BA network are shown in the supplementary information. There, the time evolution graphs for the variants with R \u2032 0 = 4.4 , 4.0, 3.6, 3.2, 2.8, 2.4, 2.0, and 1.6 are also given. The basic reproduction number R \u2032 0 = 1.6 is the same number as the original virus. Summarizing the results for various R \u2032 0 , we plot the dependence of the final number of infected on the basic reproduction number R \u2032 0 of the variant in Fig. 8. The number of infected individuals of the variant is shown by the dashed blue line, the number of infected individuals of the original species by the solid blue line, and the sum of the two by the red line. The standard deviation of the 100 samples is indicated by the error bars. The infectivity of the variant is the same as that of the original virus for R \u2032 0 = 1.6 . From Fig. 8, we observe that if the variant is highly infectious, the number of individuals infected with the variant increases. From the systematical study with infectivity of 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, and 3.0 times, we see that the effect is not simply proportional to the infectivity. We also observe that the number of individuals infected with the original species decreases slightly and the total number of the infected increases. The fluctuation in the number of infected individuals becomes significant when the infectivity of the variant is strong. However, the fluctuation of the sum of the variant and the original species is not necessarily significant. The effect of a variant on the BA network is essentially the same as that of a variant on the ER network. The characteristics of the scale-free network are not particularly evident.",
