The present study sought to analyze how the COVID-19 lockdown period affected interpersonal relationships between music teachers and students and sports coaches and athletes. As part of a semi-structured interview, eighteen participants-six athletes and their three coaches and six musicians and their three teachers-were asked to recall how their interpersonal relationships evolved during the lockdown. Findings showed that these changes could be grouped into four dimensions: establishing a new relationship; working on a new form for the relationship; developing functional, positive adaptations; and developing non-adaptive, detached relationships. Findings also showed that members of the dyad gave meaning to their interpersonal relationship in a dynamic way, even over such a short time. There were some similarities between the experiences of musicians and athletes, highlighting the importance of a well-functioning dyad and good communication between the parties.",

These restrictions were adopted almost universally, proving themselves necessary to limit the spread of the infectious coronavirus disease at a time when no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine was available. The impact which such preventive measures had on everyday life was widely acknowledged, with many inherently social activities-such as sport and music-being postponed or cancelled. Initially, many countries only imposed limitations on major sporting competitions and concerts, but these were then extended to all events which brought together significant groups of people, crowds, audiences, opponents, and teammates. Solitary sporting pursuits and musical practice were allowed because they could be carried out in strict compliance with the relevant \"social distancing\" recommendations.",

            "text": "The perception of physical, psychological, emotional, and social distancing from others can cause a range of negative emotional experiences. Social psychology explains this as a deterioration of the social belonging that lies at the core of what characterizes human beings. As an inherently social species, the feeling of being with others is best understood as a fundamental need that plays out in our everyday life. Indeed, feeling part of one or more groups plays an important role in the construction of a person's social identity. Eisenberger (2012) defines the disruption of social identity as one of the most painful and emotionally unpleasant feelings a person can experience because it involves the risk of damaging one's ability to relate to other individuals. Social belonging and affiliation are also crucial aspects of musicians and learners being able to perform well in various contexts. Recent work on collaborative music teaching methods (e.g., Nielsen et al., 2018) , improvised interaction (e.g., Aucouturier and Canonne, 2017) , and high-level performers in classical orchestras (Biasutti, 2013) has highlighted the key role of social communication and companionship. In orchestras and ensembles, for example, instrumentalists often report having the sensation that the group shares common aims, artistic ideas, and musical objectives (ibidem). The existence of musical groups can thus be understood because each \"individual contribution is framed in an overall shared design at a group level which cannot be reduced to merely the sum of the individuals\" (Biasutti, 2013, p. 63) . This is also expressed in several forms of shared musical behaviors, such as listening to music together or adapting to the other members of the ensemble (see, e.g., Schiavio et al., 2019 Schiavio et al., , 2020 .",

            "text": "It has recently been argued that the activities of athletes and musicians faced with similar challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic (Williamon and Antonini Philippe, 2020) . Generally speaking, optimal musical and sport performances must meet the social demands of competition and survive under pressure (Craft et al., 2003) . To address these challenges, musicians and athletes nurture their potential by rehearsing or training for many hours per day, making use of their good discipline and organization to repeat, transform, deconstruct and reconstruct the same physical movements until they reach the limits of their physical performance (Kenny and Ackermann, 2015; Ascenso et al., 2017) . A musician's everyday life usually involves rehearsals, recitals, solo performances, contests and concerts; similarly, many athletes train daily and participate in different kinds of competitions. For both categories, preparation is essential, and very high levels of performance are expected (Habe et al., 2019) . However, none of these activities alone can improve performance. Indeed, musicians and athletes do not spend their life in a vacuum: they are embedded in social events, cultural practices, and conventions that play out at both the individual and societal level. In most cases, cultivating their repertoire of physical movements and actions requires the support of trained professionals. Teacher-student and coach-athlete relationships, therefore, are crucial to practicing and training and to providing students and athletes with the opportunity to give their best.",

Lessons associated with high performance levels involved the following aspects: a high percentage of time during which the student listened and watched the teacher, and a significant time during which the teacher played and talked simultaneously while providing positive feedback to their own playing. Furthermore, Davidson et al. (1998) found that personality dimensions such as friendliness on the part of the student's very first teacher seemed to be very important to successful future learning. In addition, social skills were found to play a significant role in predicting a teacher's efficacy (Biasutti and Concina, 2018) as was vitality-the feeling of being alive, vigorous, and energetic. A teacher's vitality is a relevant indicator of how a student's abilities will progress and is crucial to their wellbeing and motivation (Blackwell et al., 2020) .",

Antonini Philippe et al. (2011) used Nitsch and Hackfort's (1984) model, which originated in early insights on social constructionism, to offer a detailed exploration of the nature and development of the coach-athlete relationship. This model distinguishes three dimensions of social relations in particular: the bond dimension (sympathy and antipathy); the power dimension (authority and accountability); and the co-operation dimension (task distribution). Jowett and colleagues (Jowett, 2007; Jowett and Cockerill, 2003; Jowett and Ntoumanis, 2004) , developed a model where emotions, thoughts, and behaviors were operationalized into four categories: closeness (affective or emotional interdependence); co-orientation (degree of agreement between coach and athlete); complementarity (co-operation and affiliation); and commitment (bonds and connections) (Jowett and Meek, 2000) . Poczwardowski and colleagues aimed to describe the development of coach-athlete relationships over three phases: the pre-relational phase, the transition/conclusion phase, and the post-relational phase. This model suggests that coaches and athletes can influence each other at both the professional and personal levels as their relationship develops through time.",

Coaches and athletes were involved in the three individual sports of swimming (1 coach, 2 swimmers), running (1 coach, 2 runners), and tennis (1 coach, 2 players). These specialties were chosen based on their level of expertise. Musicians were in their last year of a Master's Degree in Music at a music conservatory and earned their living from music. Athletes were university students in sport sciences and held national titles in their age categories.

The first section included questions about the dyad's general relationship (e.g., \"How would you describe your relationship with your student?\" and \"What specific feelings do you consider helpful in your coach-athlete relationship?\"). The second section included questions regarding the quality of the relationship during lockdown (e.g., \"Can you describe your role as the athlete in the coach-athlete relationship during the lockdown?\" and \"How close are you to your teacher?\"). The third section included questions about the evolution of the relationship (e.g., \"How did your relationship evolve during the lockdown?\" and \"What was different and what was the same?\").

Next, different meaning units were individuated, i.e., parts of the text which represented a single common idea related to a research question (Robson, 2011) . After each unit was labelled, the researchers conducted a review of every transcript to check for consistency across the dataset. Finally, the labelled meaning units were grouped into categories and themes with other similar meaning units, and themes were collapsed into general dimensions describing the evolution of the dyads' relationships. The team was engaged in several reflective discussions to ensure agreement in the data analysis. The coding procedure's reliability was assessed using Bellack's agreement rate (Turcotte, 1973) and ranged from 70% to 90% between coders for the different representative sequences and common structures between them. The process of reflection and verification between the researchers continued until every theme was agreed on and verified. To ensure participants' anonymity, they are identified using the following coding: Teacher (T1, T2, T3), Coach (C1, C2, C3), Musician (M1, M2, etc.), and Athlete (A1, A2, etc.).",

            "text": "Findings showed that two relational themes were linked to the construction and deconstruction of these relationships. The first theme was characterized by an adaptive relationship composed of the dimensions of discovering a new form of relationship, establishing that relationship, and functional adaptations between the partners in the dyad. Adaptive relationships involved good interaction and a new style of teaching or coaching that was adapted to the learner's characteristics. Adaptive relationships led to feelings of satisfaction and fulfillment when the learner perceived this context to be optimal. The perception of having a confident coach or teacher was one of the elements characterizing the adaptive phase. The aspect of communication also emerged from every experience. Indeed, the way the coach interacted verbally with the athlete represented one of the significant elements for the learner and characterized the relationship either positively or negatively. We found the same process happening with musicians. This can be expressed in several ways: the presence of feedback about the practice, encouragement, criticism, or the explanation of technical or tactical choices. Regarding this component, associations could be established with other studies Antonini Philippe and Seiler, 2006; Meissner & Timmers, 2020; Jowett and Cockerill, 2003) that have shown communication to be one of the elements which musicians and athletes define as essential to a good interpersonal relationship. The playing time which a teacher allocates to a musician is also a recurring factor influencing students' satisfaction (Siebenaler, 1997) . The interactional character of teachers and coaches was highlighted as a factor involving their predisposition to listening, supportiveness, or even to being present as a reference point: these all appeared to be important measures of a healthy relationship. In a positive relational pattern, findings showed that there were nevertheless some difficulties related to the content of practice that were associated with performance management. This particular context led subjects to set up mechanisms of adaptation to their coach or teacher's requirements in order to overcome the problem. Adaptation remained a fundamental construct necessary to ensure equilibrium within the dyad (Pennings et al., 2018; Schinke et al., 2012) .",

There was clearly a difference between musicians and athletes concerning this theme, including changes in the coach or teacher's attitude, destabilization, and resignation. It can be noted that a bad relationship in terms of communication-especially concerning exchanges with teachers and their opinions-did not have a negative impact on the perception of the musicians' practice of the student. Many quotes stated that a lack of interaction or a feeling of uncertainty about the teacher's opinions did not affect the student's performance. The resulting distancing from the teacher caused a reflection on the relative importance of the relationship and the emergence of a more inward-looking attitude on the part of the musician, who thus decided to focus on their performance. The learning process itself seemed to become an autonomous act (Creech and Hallam, 2003) . In accord with (Schinke et al., 2012) , the present study's students and athletes could be characterized as proactive learners, inspired to participate in activities autonomously. Those authors explained that this was possible when the performer was passionately involved in their activity. Moreover, developing a student's autonomy can lead to them having a better understanding of their own learning process and, in consequence, developing more lasting forms of learning (McPherson et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "Another characteristic of the maladaptive form of the relationship is its total breakdown caused by the relational distance and seemingly reflected in a negative way in athletes' practice. That theme seemed to appear essentially in the domain of sport. One explanation involves the following difference between athletes and musicians: the latter, in most cases, had the possibility to continue playing music and rehearsing whereas many athletes had to face important changes in connection with reduced space and the adaptation of their sports practice. The causes of such situations seemed to be found in the decrease-or complete disappearance-of the time that the coach dedicated to their athlete, which led to a decrease in their motivation. This pattern was also affected by the change in the coach's behavior, which implied a psychological destabilization of the athlete's level of commitment. This appeared to show the dissonance between the different protagonists' desires. Various studies Antonini Philippe et al., 2011) have highlighted the importance of interpersonal relationships in the quest for performance, including a shared commitment to optimization. These studies underlined the coach's decisive influence on the outcome of the athlete's personal efforts by their influence on the athlete's passion for practicing. A maladaptive form of relationship, on the other hand, seemed to push athletes into a state of frustration and brought out their need to change club in order to reverse the negative trend which they found themselves following.",

Also, only nine dyads participated in the study, therefore, it is impossible to generalize these results.

The extent of the evolution in these relationships, in just a couple of months, was significant and very interesting. There were also some points of similarity between musicians and athletes. The present study revealed that mutual recognition between the coach or teacher and the athlete or musician is fundamental to a well-functioning relationship, and hence to performance. This recognition is directly associated with the emotional needs of the learner and thus requires constant maintenance and nurturing from both sides.",
