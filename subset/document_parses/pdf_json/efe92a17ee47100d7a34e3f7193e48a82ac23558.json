COVID-19 Trial Finder also includes a web-based visualization of the geographic distribution of COVID-19 trials. The initial search is by location and radius distance from trial sites; this is refined through a set of dynamically generated medical questions to assess patient eligibility for nearby COVID-19 trials. They assessed the precision of COVID-19 Trial Finder for COVID-19 using 20 case reports from LitCOVID. Overall precision across the 20 cases was 79.76%, although it varied widely across cases. The major factor contributing to imprecision was the inability to generate relevant questions in some instances which prevented filtering out irrelevant trials. The system (https://covidtrialx.dbmi.columbia.edu) and its source code (https://github.com/WengLab-InformaticsResearch/COVID19-Tri-alFinder) are accessible online.",

The relationship between trust in public health authorities and intention was indirect. Sex, education, and past invasion of privacy had no significant influence on intention. Study findings provide the foundation for actions to address the identified factors and, subsequently, increase adoption of contact tracing mobile applications.",

The addition of focal loss to the neural network approach was designed to address class imbalance. FLANNEL consistently outperformed baseline models in COVID-19 identification achieving a precision of 0.78, recall of 0.86, and F1 of 0.82. These promising findings highlight the potential of the FLANNEL approach for differentiating COVID-19 from other types of pneumonias.",

The former is particularly problematic for COVID-19, where many individuals are asymptomatic, and not all those infected have been tested. Using 2 large-scale datasets (2491 patients from COVID-NET and 5700 patients from New York hospitals), they estimated the posterior distribution of the risk ratio using the observed frequency of comorbidities in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the prevalence of comorbidities in the general population. They found that cardiovascular diseases carried the highest hospitalization risk for COVID-19 patients, followed by diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and obesity. This innovative approach has the potential to assist with resource planning to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.",
