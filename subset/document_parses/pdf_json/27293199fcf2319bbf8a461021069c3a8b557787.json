This study aims to describe the HCV care cascade and patient characteristics in Florida. Methods: This analysis combined HCV-related laboratory data and patient characteristics from two, large US laboratory datasets that included individuals tested for HCV antibody (Ab) and HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load between January 2015 and December 2019. A decline in sequential HCV RNA viral loads was used to impute HCV treatment. Machine-learning algorithms were used to identify cured patients. The actual number of individuals with HCV Ab screening, and the number and percentage of persons who were HCV RNA-positive and treated, were calculated. Results: The number of persons in Florida diagnosed as HCV RNA-positive was 31,659 in 2019. The number of individuals HCV Ab screened in 2019 was 1,024,379, an increase of 82.5% from 2015. The percentage of HCV Abpositive individuals was 4.1%, demonstrating a 16.2% decrease from 2015. The percentage of HCV RNA-positive patients who were treated was 27.0%, a 10.5% decrease from 2015 to 2019.",

            "text": "Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with a substantial clinical, societal, and economic burden globally [1, 2] , with an estimated 2.4 million people living with chronic infection in the United States (US) [3] . Florida has a documented heavy burden of this disease, with nearly 1% of the population HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)-positive (n/N = 133,200/ 15,620,600; 0.85%), and is one of nine states that accounts for 52% of all HCV infections in the US [4] . Untreated HCV infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality [5] . Mean annual total all-cause medical costs increase by US$24,834 for untreated versus treated patients with HCV infection [2] . The burden of HCV infection is especially high among people who inject drugs (PWID), with up to 70% of new HCV infections occurring among PWID in the US, partly due to the current opioid epidemic [6, 7] . To address this increasing number of infections, specifically in younger patients, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Preventive Services Task Force, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have now all endorsed universal, one-time screening for HCV in adults 18 years of age and older [8] [9] [10] . The burden of HCV infection disproportionately impacts Florida due to its large retiree population, as well as other high-risk populations, including non-Hispanic Black individuals [11, 12] , and those individuals in correctional facilities [13, 14] , especially incarcerated Hispanic persons [15] . Increased resources for improving knowledge of this disease, linkage to care, and subsequent treatment in these high-risk populations are needed to reduce the prevalence of chronic HCV [13, [16] [17] [18] .",

With the WHO target year of elimination less than 9 years away, tracking progress towards elimination and identification of barriers, both nationally and within individual states, is important. In the US, there are marked differences between individual states in HCV prevalence and access to HCV treatment through government-funded payers that may prevent meaningful progress towards achieving elimination [11] . In Florida, there are challenges with HCV screening and diagnosis that inhibit progress towards elimination, including the lack of legislation to support opt-out testing for HCV similar to that for HIV, barriers at the provider level, and the restriction of funding to treat HCV-positive incarcerated populations or to support harm reduction programs [20] [21] [22] . Understanding the epidemiology of HCV infection in Florida and tracking the progress of meeting elimination targets provides an opportunity for the state to consider supporting plans that will reduce barriers to screening and linkage to care. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to describe the number of individuals with HCV infection and to provide data on distinct aspects of the HCV care cascade [i.e., number of screenings, number of antibody (Ab) and RNA-positive individuals, and proportion of patients receiving treatment] in the state of Florida.",

Patient age, geographic state (i.e., Florida), HCV Ab test, HCV RNA test, HCV genotype, fibrosis stage, and HIV coinfection status were also collected. Data from all individuals in the state of Florida who were screened for HCV Ab and/or were tested for HCV RNA during this time were included in the analysis. Treatment initiation was assumed if an individual showed a decline in HCV RNA levels based on a viral load decline of at least 1.2 9 log 10 units from the time of their first positive HCV RNA test. Machinelearning algorithms were developed to identify patients who were cured and had been previously described [23, 24] . Briefly, machinelearning algorithms were validated using a separate set of data from 92,099 treated HCV individuals with medical and pharmacy claims available in the Symphony Health Solutions claims database from 2015 to 2019. Individuals identified by machine-learning algorithms as having been treated and cured based on successive viral load declines were classified as such in the following year (i.e., if identified as treated in 2016, they were labeled as cured in 2017). This data source did not include information on timing, type, or duration of treatment. Longitudinal methodology and imputation were applied to determine the number of HCV RNApositive individuals each year and to carry HCVrelated results forward.

Similarly, the proportion of HCV RNA-positive persons among those screened dropped 18.0%. We estimated 149 infections per 100,000 persons, which is higher than the Florida Department of Health's 2019 estimate of 94 infections per 100,000 persons, derived from the state's reportable disease surveillance system; our study reported 31,659 HCV RNA-positive individuals in 2019, versus the Florida Department of Health's report of 19,917 [25] . However, both studies derived data without extrapolation, thus the rates identified are likely underestimations. The current study demonstrated a bimodal age distribution of HCV RNA-positive persons, suggesting that screening efforts cannot simply target one population, further bolstering the need for universal screening. In 2019, less than one-third of HCV RNA-positive patients received treatment, similar to the 26.8% of HCV RNA-positive patients nationally that received treatment in 2019 [24] . The decline in treatment rates may be partly due to the fact that fewer patients are treated year after year. In this study, treatment rate was calculated by the total number of persons treated divided by the total number of persons diagnosed as HCV RNApositive (i.e., based on viral load . Thus, treatment rates were also affected by the total number of persons diagnosed as HCV RNA-positive, which decreased from 2015 to 2019. It is also possible that treatment rates declined due to a lack of perceived importance of treating HCV in younger and/or asymptomatic patients. Likewise, rises in HCV infections have been linked to the opioid epidemic, and it is possible that treating addiction is prioritized over treating concurrent HCV [7] . Treatment estimates in Florida are in line with recently published national estimates [24] , despite data from the current study showing that the number of HCV Ab screenings per 100,000 persons in Florida is nearly double that of national rates (4809 vs. 2417) and that the number of HCV RNA-positive individuals per 100,000 persons in Florida is also higher (149 vs. 110) [24] , thus suggesting that improvements in linkage to care and treatment are needed.",

As of 2020, Florida had removed prescriber restrictions, but still required 1 month of sobriety to access treatment under Medicaid; there were no fibrosis stage restrictions. Florida is 1 of 13 states that maintains sobriety restrictions under Medicaid [26] [27] [28] , despite clinical guidelines stating that current or recent drug use is not a contraindication to treatment [6] . Moreover, Florida is 1 of 9 states (California, New York, Tennessee, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Texas) that contain 52% of all HCV-infected individuals [4] . As of 2020, most of these states had no restrictions on fibrosis staging (except TX) in order to receive treatment, but 7 had sobriety requirements (no restrictions in CA or OH). Rates of treatment in these states is in line with national estimates [24] , except in Ohio (10%) and Michigan (15%) [29] . In Ohio, Medicaid did not cover treatment for patients with low fibrosis scores (\\F2), and only approved treatment once disease progressed. As of 2019, the Ohio Department of Medicaid approved treatment in earlier stages of disease, which should increase treatment rates [30] . Michigan Medicaid launched the State Plan on Eliminating HCV in 2020, which included requested partnerships with drug manufacturers to eliminate the cost barriers of direct-acting antiviral treatments [31] . Florida is not a Medicaid expansion state, which impacts the number of patients, especially the uninsured, who are able to afford and access treatment. A major obstacle to treating uninsured patients is cost, resulting in fewer patients receiving treatment [32] . Yet, HCV-infected patients, regardless of insurance status, achieve comparable clinical outcomes and cure rates when given access to treatment, suggesting that patient assistance programs that reduce the cost of treatment also offer a clinical benefit. Removing HCV treatment restrictions in Florida, and nationally, may significantly boost elimination efforts.

            "text": "Aside from treatment costs, additional barriers to screening and testing identified by a study in Miami, Florida, included lack of education regarding HCV care, the cost of testing and implementing screening programs, and provider uncertainty regarding patient insurance status [22] . HCV-related or injection drug use-related stigma have also been shown to greatly impact care-seeking behaviors and, yet once diagnosed, only a small number of patients are successfully linked to care [5] . Poor patient retention may result from long waiting times for specialist referrals or test results, requirement for multiple follow-up appointments, and low patient motivation [33] . Moreover, some populations (e.g., incarcerated individuals, PWID, and minorities) are disproportionately impacted by HCV and may face more specific barriers. For example, treatment for incarcerated individuals for whom HCV infection is endemic has been hampered by judicial rulings and state funding decisions that guide healthcare spending [34, 35] . Among minorities in an urban setting (56% Black),[70% of HCV patients had not initiated HCV therapy and frequently cited psychosocial factors, provider barriers, or insurance-related challenges as barriers to treatment [21] . Decentralizing and simplifying HCV care to include point-of-care testing and community-based care are vital to elimination efforts, as they may mitigate some barriers (e.g., long wait times, stigma, need for specialists) [36] . Increased HCV-specific funding within the Florida Department of Health is needed to further improve patient engagement, screening, diagnosis, linkage to care, and treatment rates, particularly among high-risk groups [20] .",

The program endeavors to specifically reduce barriers affecting underserved populations through the use of public and private partnerships [20] . Other states have initiated HCV elimination programs to achieve the WHO targets by 2030, and the data and discussion presented here support the subsequent establishment of similar efforts in Florida [37] . Other solutions to improve treatment access include expanding Medicaid eligibility criteria, reducing stigma, and increasing patient engagement and provider availability [38] . Altogether, these may provide opportunities to overcome the existing barriers to achieving elimination in Florida.",

Likewise, the geographic areas of the two laboratory companies varied by year due to contractual agreements, thus geographical data from one year may not exactly match that of the next. The HCV prevalence data prior to 2015 were not captured in our study. Moreover, details pertaining to the specific context of testing or treatment (i.e., inpatient, outpatient, etc.) or types or durations of treatments prescribed were not available. The use of viral load as a proxy for cured individuals could be inaccurate owing to insufficient follow-up time. No causal inferences, including specific prior HCV treatment experience, including regimen (e.g., direct-acting antiviral or interferon-based), or duration may be drawn from this descriptive analysis.",

Favorable modifications to current policies would include reducing payer and sobriety restrictions to advance progress towards HCV elimination. Furthermore, public health efforts to decrease barriers to screening and to support linkage to care are needed to reduce the burden of HCV infection in Florida.",
