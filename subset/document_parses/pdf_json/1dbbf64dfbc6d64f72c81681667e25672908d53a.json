There are several existing guidelines for nursing homes issued by governmental bodies [18, 19] , which describe work restrictions, quarantine, testing, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent the spread of infection. However, these guidelines may not take into account the under-resourced situations of nursing homes, and thus not be fully adhered to due to staff shortages [20] . In addition, nursing homes often have few licensed practical nurses and certificated nursing assistants. In such a situation, the guidelines may be too general for staff without the basic medical knowledge to make decisions in practice requiring complex care [21] . For example, they do not specify how frequently the staff and patients should disinfect their hands.

Talk as quietly as possible to reduce chance of transmission via droplets 5. Clean with a soap or disinfect with bleach or alcohol. 6. Ventilate rooms as often as possible. 7. Do a health check (body temperature check and check whether you have sore throat or cough) immediately before commencing duty, not just in the morning. Essential Mindset 8. Create an environment in which the infected people are not blamed. 9. Understand that infection control is not perfect but still effective in reducing infection risks. 10 .

Overly rigorous infection control procedures, repeated waves of infection, and cluster outbreaks may be deteriorating the situation. Even more, if staff are required to follow strict rules that aim at zero risk, the resulting job stress and feelings of being pushed beyond their training may increase the risk of burnout, which may have a negative impact on the prevention of outbreaks [36, 37] .",

After the 2011 nuclear accident, a majority of hospital staff left their workplace and sever staff shortage occurred, which lasted for longer than a year [2, 38] . Such unwillingness to report for duty seems common in CBRNE disasters, including pandemics, that provoke fear of invisible hazards [39, 40] . This functional damage was not caused by the lack of scientific guideposts. Instead, it was caused by differences in risk perception by people, even those within the legal exposure dose limits derived from regulatory science [41] . Because of this difference in perception of 'how safe is safe', setting clear safety levels often provoked criticism by those who consider the limit too high [42] . This means that just showing evidence-based facts cannot always prevent social confusion without close communication with on-site staff [28] . In some cases, just showing numbers and figures may provoke a sense of aversion among on-site people because they are talking about not science but their own life [43] .
