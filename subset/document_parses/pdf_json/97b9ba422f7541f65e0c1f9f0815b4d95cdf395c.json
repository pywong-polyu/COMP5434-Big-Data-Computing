In order to control the epidemic, various types of COVID-19 vaccines have sprung up around the world, but the vast majority have only been approved for adults (3) . However, with the prevalence of the Omicron variant, a highly divergent variant of syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), immune protection for adolescents, children and even infants seems to be imminent. Following the approval of CoronaVac for children aged 3-17 years, the BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine was urgently approved for children aged 5 years and older on November 2, 2021 (4) . The sequential authorization of two different vaccines announces that the focus of vaccination is gradually shifting to younger children, as the fight against the epidemic progresses, which not only helps protect children's health and interrupt community epidemics but also promotes educational equity and economic recovery (5) .",

The following statistical information should be provided as outcome indicators: (1) the incidence of adverse events after vaccination, including total adverse reactions, local adverse reactions, systemic adverse reactions, and any specific adverse reactions, (2) humoral immune responses, including the seroconversion after vaccination, (3) cellular immune responses, such as IFN\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot, (4) incidence of confirmed COVID-19 post-vaccination. After removing duplicate records, two review authors (YD and LC) independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all records, and then conducted a full-text review with predetermined criteria.

Using a pre-developed data extraction form in Microsoft Excel, two authors independently extracted the following data: name of the first author, date of publication, study protocol, baseline characteristics of participants, sample size, intervention details, and outcome indicators. The seroconversion was defined as at least a fourfold increase in geometric mean titres (GMT) from baseline after vaccination. A secondary case definition of COVID-19 was also adopted, according to which patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 as long as they were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and accompanied by one or more associated symptoms. In order to avoid missing data as much as possible, we carefully read the original text and supplementary materials of the included studies. If the original article grouped vaccinees according to age, dose of vaccination, etc., we would combine the data for each subgroup. If the original article did not provide the data in the form we expected, the required data would be calculated manually based on the information provided. When the required dichotomous variables were provided in the form of totals and percentages, we would obtain the available data by calculating the product. When the original text did not provide the information we needed, we attempted to obtain the corresponding information from the supplementary material. Considering the limited time, we did not contact the corresponding author to obtain the original data. In case of any disagreement, consensus would be reached through discussion or consultation with a third authors (YS).",

The I 2 statistic was used to estimate the level of heterogeneity, and significant heterogeneity was considered when the I 2 value was >50% (30) . Following the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook (29) and taking into account the different characteristics of the included studies (31) , all data would be pooled by using random-effects models, regardless of the heterogeneity. However, if there were <5 studies available, the random-effects model would no longer be applicable. In this case, the fixed-effects model would be chosen to pool the data. To trace the source of heterogeneity, we performed sensitivity analyses by excluding pooled studies one by one. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were conducted according to the number of vaccinations, type of vaccines, age of the recipients, and specific adverse reactions. When appropriate, direct comparisons were also conducted between prime and boost vaccinations, as well as among different ages. In addition, if ten or more RCT studies were eventually included, the funnel plot analysis of the primary outcome was planned to assess publication bias (32) .",

In addition, there were minor differences in the grouping methods of the two RCTs, with one (36) grouping vaccinees into age groups of 3-5, 6-11, and 12-17 years, while the other (37) grouping participants into age groups of 3-5, 6-12, and 13-17 years.

In particular, the immune response to BNT162b2 Covid-19 vaccine might be greater in adolescents aged 12 to 15 years than in young adults aged 16 to 25 years, because the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the GMR is >1.",

This difference may be related to the fact that immune function is not yet well developed in young children. Furthermore, although there was no significant difference in the risk of adverse reactions between singledose and double-dose vaccines, the double-dose regimen was significantly superior to the single-dose schedule in terms of humoral immunogenicity and prophylactic efficacy. However, data from Zhu et al. (38) showed no further enhancement in the intensity of T-cell immune response after booster vaccination. This result should be viewed with caution due to the limited data on the cellular immune response.

Although this possibility has been substantially reduced by detailed subgroup analysis, the small sample size may still limit the statistical validity of this trial. Furthermore, for the cellular immune response after vaccination, only one RCT (38) provided relevant data. In addition, although methodological heterogeneity and clinical heterogeneity were well controlled, statistical heterogeneity could not be ignored.

Besides, recent data (43) indicates that inactivated vaccination may cause pathophysiological changes in vaccine recipients similar to those in infected individuals, suggesting that careful consideration is needed when vaccinating children, even with inactivated vaccines that appear to be safer, especially for children with underlying disease. What's more, given that MIS-C may be an immune disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we cannot exclude the possibility that this complication is instead induced after COVID-19 vaccination (11) .

Besides, immune protection for this specific group of newborns could be considered starting with pregnant women. Recent studies (46) (47) (48) have shown that antibodies can be detected in the placenta or breast milk after vaccination of pregnant or lactating women without a significant increase in adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes, which may suggest an alternative route of immune protection for the fetus or newborn.

Surveys around the world (16, 17, 51) have shown that distrust in the safety and efficacy of vaccines is an important reason why parents are reluctant to have their children vaccinated, and that most parents are willing to vaccinate their children when the vaccine is safe and reliable. Therefore, high-quality studies assessing the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine in younger children appear to be essential to eliminate childhood vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, parental fear of COVID-19 is an important influencing factor in the decision to vaccinate children (51, 52) , stemming not only from the health risks children may face, but also from the risk of family transmission due to children's infection, which may have a negative impact on the family's economic income as well as social activities. Therefore, in order to enhance parents' perception of COVID-19, local governments should proactively provide a platform for scientific communication and share valid data in a timely manner. Furthermore, race, religious affiliation, trust in government agencies, willingness to get vaccinated for themselves, education level, annual income, work environment, mother tongue, and age may all be important factors influencing parent's willingness (18, 51) . As the epidemic progressed, surveys from various countries spurted out, but most were single-center surveys. Surveys may be contradictory from country to country (18, 19) , and parental attitudes may change as the epidemic evolves. Therefore, in addition to continuing to advance research on vaccines, a systematic review that brings together various influencing factors is highly desirable (41) and will help us assess the influencing factors that affect parental willingness in different contexts, thus guiding us to take various effective measures to advance the childhood vaccination process for various populations in different regions.",

Nevertheless, there is still a large gap in trials to confirm the safety and efficacy of different COVID-19 vaccines in people under 18 years of age, especially in younger children under 3 years old and even infants. There is an urgent need to conduct multicenter, large-sample clinical studies of COVID-19 vaccine in younger children with a wider range of vaccine types and longer follow-up periods, to promote global universalization and standardization of childhood vaccination. Given the rapidly changing epidemiological situation and the advancing vaccine research process, this meta-analysis should be updated in time when more data are available.",
