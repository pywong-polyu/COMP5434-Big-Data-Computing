Methods This descriptive study used the snowball sampling method to recruit participants. The study was conducted between 18 and 25 April 2020 with a total of 710 participants. The data were collected using a sociodemographic questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Ethics committee approval was obtained to conduct the study, and the data were analyzed using the SPSS 24.0 statistical package program using descriptive statistics, t tests and ANOVA. Results In the study, 46.8% of the participants were in the 26-35 age group, 60.7% were female, 19.9% worked at clinics with COVID-19 patients (service, intensive care and emergency clinics), and 17.6% had a chronic disease. The state and trait anxiety mean scores of the participants were 60.29 \u00b1 6.13 and 44.18 \u00b1 7.69, respectively. Statistically significant differences were found in the participants' state and trait anxiety levels with respect to their age, gender, unit of work, marital status, status of having children and presence of a chronic disease (p < 0.05). Conclusion The state and trait anxiety levels of the healthcare workers in the study were found to be \"severe\" and \"moderate,\" respectively.",

            "text": "Globalization has accelerated the spread of the disease across continents, causing exponential growth in cases of infection throughout most of the world in a very short time. All these developments have brought about some changes and problems. Anxiety, panic and fear in societies have become evident in almost every area, including economic concerns for individuals, physical and mental problems caused by social isolation, interruption of educational activities, withdrawal from production and stress due to social distancing (Qiu et al. 2020; Duan and Zhu 2020) . Health systems, which were caught unprepared for such a pandemic, have faced various problems, mainly including lack of sufficient protective materials, excessive workload, loss of workforce and staff shortage. This has caused an unprecedented state of psychological stress, fear, anxiety and depression for healthcare workers . In particular, healthcare workers at hospitals have always been at the forefront of coping with pandemics, facing serious risks to fulfill their duties. Healthcare workers who are in close contact with COVID-19 patients are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, and they are likely to spread the virus to their colleagues and family members Lin et al. 2007; Lehmann et al. 2015) . The difficulties and stress they experience may trigger common mental disorders, including anxiety, insomnia, somatization, obsessivecompulsive symptoms and depressive disorders (Bao et al. 2020; Mo et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Lai et al. 2020; Xiao et al. 2020) . Additionally, the balance between self-sacrifice, an essential component of healthcare professional duty, and personal fear for oneself and one's family often causes conflict and maladjustment in healthcare workers . This conflict and maladjustment are combined with patient care stress, leading to increased mental distress (Xiang et al. 2020) . In this context, it is important to protect the morale and mental health of healthcare workers, because this affects the successful delivery of healthcare services. Most healthcare workers in isolation units and hospitals do not receive any support for their own mental healthcare (Duan and Zhu 2020; Xiang et al. 2020) . Hospitals should focus on providing both psychological support and timely psychological assistance for improving the coping strategies of their employees. It is very important for healthcare workers to strengthen their emotions and coping strategies to effectively deal with pandemics in order to prevent and control these kinds of adverse events . Increased efforts are needed to manage anxiety and stress in this group and help them prevent burnout, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder in the longer term (Bao et al. 2020; Cullen et al. 2020) . Research data are needed to develop evidence-based strategies to reduce the adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms of the COVID-19 pandemic .",

The study focused on healthcare workers in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it used the snowball sampling method. The survey was shared on health-related social media platforms (such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter), and the respondents were asked to share it with others. Before starting the survey, the participants were informed about the purpose and content of the study, emphasizing that participation was on a voluntary basis. The participants' identity information was not recorded in the survey. The sample size was calculated as 677 using the formula with an unknown universe. The snowball method, one of the probabilistic sampling types, was used. The sample consisted of healthcare workers from any healthcare institution/organization who agreed to participate in the study.

(1970) to determine people's state (Kvaal et al. 2005 ) and trait anxiety levels and adapted to Turkish by \u00d6ner and LeCompte (1985) . The inventory consists of two separate scales. The State Anxiety Inventory is a selfassessment scale consisting of short and clear expressions to measure how the individual feels at a particular time and under certain conditions. It consists of questions that can be answered as \"(1) not at all,\" (2) \"somewhat,\" (3) \"moderately so\" and (4) \"very much\" to evaluate the anxiety levels of individuals included in a study. The Trait Anxiety Inventory mainly evaluates feelings of apprehension, tension, irritability and anxiety. It measures how an individual feels independent of their current state and conditions. The STAI is composed of two separate scales with a total of 40 items, whereby the State Anxiety Inventory consists of 20 items to evaluate how individuals feel \"now,\" whereas the Trait Anxiety Inventory consists of 20 items to evaluate how individuals feel \"in general.\" The State Anxiety Inventory rates one's emotions or behaviors according to their severity, and the Trait Anxiety Inventory rates them according to their frequency, using a 4point Likert-type scale. Each STAI item is given a weighted score of 1 to 4. Scores for both scales range from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 80, where a higher score indicates a greater level of anxiety. STAI scores are interpreted as follows: 0-19, normal or no anxiety; 20-39, mild to moderate anxiety; 40-59, moderate to severe anxiety; 60-79, severe anxiety; and 80 and above, panic and crisis (\u00c7ak\u0131r and \u00d6zbay\u0131r 2018) .

Since COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, there is a dramatically increased risk of transmission of the virus to healthcare workers . Although the rate of virus transmission to healthcare workers is unknown across the world, we assume that the figures are extremely high. Healthcare workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic, care for each COVID-19 patient. Given that the pandemic can last for weeks or months, healthcare workers are more likely to encounter adverse conditions such as long-term exposure to the virus, increased workload, ethical dilemmas, lack of protective equipment, lack of effective medicines, poor social and medical support, loss of confidence, loss of social relationships and abnormalities in their daily routines Qiu et al. 2020 ). All of these conditions increase anxiety. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the level of anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare workers. Anxiety is defined as \"an unpleasant emotional state or condition perceived by individuals as 'threatening' or 'dangerous' to their basic values and existence,\" and it is handled from two perspectives as state and trait anxiety. State anxiety may be defined as a transitory emotional state characterized by subjective feelings of apprehension and nervousness associated with activation (arousal) of the autonomic nervous system at a particular time. Therefore, state anxiety, which is accepted as temporary and short-term, comes into question while dealing with dangerous or threatening situations under a certain condition. In contrast, trait anxiety refers to a relatively stable individual difference and permanent personality trait in both anxiety tendency reflected as anxiety states manifested over time and probability of future anxiety (Spielberger 1972; Chew et al. 2020 ). This study found that state anxiety increased as the age of the healthcare workers increased, where those aged above 46 years had higher trait anxiety levels than the other age groups. There was a statistically significant difference in the participants' state and trait anxiety levels with respect to their age (Table 3) . Qiu et al. (2020) reported that individuals over 60 years of age had higher levels of psychiatric problems such as anxiety and depression during pandemics. One study concluded that young people had lower anxiety levels than the elderly ). These results, which suggest that mental symptoms such as anxiety or depression are lower in young individuals than the elderly, may be associated with the fact that mortality increases as age increases. The present study found a statistically significant relationship between gender and state-trait anxiety in healthcare workers, where women had significantly higher state and trait anxiety levels (Table 3) . Studies conducted with healthcare workers during the pandemic have reported that women had higher anxiety levels Huang et al. 2020) , emotional issues such as stress and depression , and decreased social functionality (Qiu et al. 2020) .",

This may be because those who are married are stressed by not seeing their spouses and children and have a high risk of carrying/transmitting the virus to their loved ones when they see and spend time with them. Mo et al. (2020) also stated that nurses have high work stress in pandemics, which is mostly associated with the status of having children. The causes of anxiety in healthcare workers include uncertainties at the workplace such as exposure to COVID-19, fear of transmitting the infection to their families and concerns about who would meet their personal and family needs if they were infected. Additionally, it should be noted that those with school-age children were also worried about who would take care of their children while schools were closed in this process (Shanafelt et al. 2020) .",

There is still a lack of an effective drug or vaccine for COVID infection, and the number of COVID-19-positive cases and deaths is also increasing among healthcare workers. Therefore, it is important to take necessary precautions in this regard. This study revealed significantly higher state anxiety levels in the healthcare workers who stayed anywhere outside their home due to the COVID-19 pandemic ( Table 3) . Accommodation of healthcare workers anyplace other than their homes is considered to increase their anxiety levels, as they disrupt their routine, stay in an unfamiliar environment, do not receive social support and become isolated (are unable to see their loved ones including spouse, children, parents), which increases their longing for their loved ones. The study also found that the healthcare workers who tested positive for COVID-19 and those who had a colleague or relative who tested positive for COVID-19 had higher state anxiety levels ( Table 3) . Fear of testing positive for COVID-19, having a colleague or relative testing positive for COVID-19, becoming infected with the virus or death due to virus infection, transmitting the virus to others, and staying apart or losing their loved ones might have caused anxiety in the healthcare workers.",

(2020) also reported that healthcare workers experienced moderate to severe anxiety during the pandemic. In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused similar problems in healthcare workers, including high emotional distress, fear of transmission (Phua et al. 2005; Nickell et al. 2004; Maunder et al. 2004) , stigma Bai et al. 2004 ) and worry about family (Nickell et al. 2004; Wong et al. 2005; Maunder 2004 ). Additionally, this study concluded that the healthcare workers experienced serious concerns such as virus transmission, virus infection, future anxiety and fear of death. The anxiety in healthcare workers may be explained by their concern that the pandemic will be continuous, and there is uncertainty about when it will end. Apart from the pandemic process, healthcare workers have to work under more severe conditions than many employees. Irregular working hours, prolonged hours at work, heavy workload, stress, risk of getting infectious diseases, facing stressed people and being exposed to verbal or physical assault are the main problems that many healthcare workers encounter while doing their job and which are considered to increase their trait anxiety. Healthcare workers should be supported to provide patients with quality and functional healthcare services and ensure their continuity in this pandemic period. It should be noted that healthcare workers try to flatten the pandemic curve, but the curve of their mental health problems caused by the pandemic should also be flattened after the pandemic.",
