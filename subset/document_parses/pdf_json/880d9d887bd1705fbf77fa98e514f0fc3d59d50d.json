Another function of the frozen section is to give the surgeon some indication whether lesional tissue has been sampled. A number of series have been published and should be consulted about the results of open lung and transbronchial biopsies in children. 1 Another diagnostic procedure is the fine-needle aspiration biopsy,2 in which the needle is guided by computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography. The application of fine-needle aspiration biopsy is mainly confined to the presence of a discrete mass with the clinical prospects of recurrent or metastatic tumor. A diagnosis by this biopsy technique has medical and economic advantages.

            "text": "It is important to understand the difference between hyaline membrane disease (HMD) and the formation of hyaline membranes (HMs). The term hyaline membrane disease is used almost exclusively to describe the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) associated with prematurity, which is due to the immature lungs' failure to synthesize adequate amounts of surfactant. 3 The risk of developing HMD is increased in males, infants of diabetic mothers, patients with preeclampsia,4 and after cesarean section. In contrast, the formation of HM is associated with many other primary diseases such as infection (congenital or acquired), meconium aspiration, hemorrhage, and shock. Hyaline membrane disease in the classic form, as described by Lauweryns S in 1970, has been largely prevented by inhaled surfactant therapy on the first day of life, which has become the standard of care since the early 1990s. Today, HMD is seen as the cause of death, at autopsy, only infrequently, usually in the extremely premature infant (23 to 25 weeks' gestation) who dies in the first day or two of life. Infants who survive severe RDS for longer than 3 or 4 days before death usually display the changes of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) described below. Formation of hyaline membranes can also be seen in postmature infants. Seo and colleagues 6 described their occurrence in 17 of 21 postterm infants dying within 10 days of birth. Amniotic and meconium aspiration was present in 95% of these cases.",

Radiographically, there is a typical ground-glass appearance of the lungs with air bronchograms and diffusely scattered reticulogranular opacities. On gross examination the lungs are firm, atelectatic, and typically sink when placed in water. The pleura is smooth and deep tan to red. The cut surface reveals a deep red parenchyma that oozes bloody fluid and resembles liver more than lung. Microscopically there is a diffuse atelectasis that accentuates the bronchi and dilated bronchioles and alveolar ducts ( Fig. 7.1) . Smooth, homogeneous pink membranes, the HMs from which the disease derives its name lie free in the lumen or are closely applied to surfaces of respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts ( Fig. 7 .2). The membranes are composed of necrotic alveolar lining cells, plasma transudate, inhaled amniotic fluid, and, if hemorrhage is present, fibrin. Homogeneously pink or finely granular transudate is often present in alveolar saccules, occasionally extending to bronchiolar and bronchial levels. Hemorrhagic material may be present focally throughout the lung. Pulmonary lymphatics are dilated particularly around pulmonary veins. 7 Hyaline membranes may be seen in infants dying as early as 1 to 4 hours after birth. Well-formed membranes are usually present by 12 to 24 hours, and by 36 to 48 hours, in cases of uncomplicated disease, organization of these membranes occurs with separation of the membrane from the underlying wall and engulfment of the material by macrophages (Fig. 7.3 ). Final repair of the bronchiolar and alveolar duct wall is accomplished by resurfacing of the wall by bronchiolar epithelial cells or type I and II alveolar lining cells. 8 ,9 In the majority of FIGURE 7.2.

Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Both the definition and pathology of BPD have evolved since the initial description by Northway et alY and Nash et alY in separate articles in 1967. Antenatal glucocorticoid therapy, postnatal surfactant therapy, and improved mechanical ventilation have minimized severe lung injury in all but the smallest of premature babies. Thus, BPD is now infrequent in treated infants with gestational age exceeding 30 weeks or birth weight more than 1200 g.

            "text": "Clinically, a more extensive definition was proposed at the 2000 National Institutes of Health (NIH) BPD workshop, which uses oxygen dependency at 36 weeks post-J.T. Stocker et al. menstrual age, total duration of oxygen supplementation, positive pressure requirements, and gestational age of the infant to delineate the three degrees of severity: mild, moderate, and severe. I4 A subsequent study evaluated this new definition and concluded that it does offer a better description of underlying pulmonary disease and correlates with the infant's maturity, growth, and overall severity of disease. IS The incidence of BPD is dependent on multiple factors, the most important of which are gestational age, weight, and the definition used. Using the above definition, one retrospective study of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants looked at the mortality and incidence and severity of BPD in three groups of patients over time. Cohort A was from 1986 to 1990 (pre-surfactant era and use of conventional intermittent mandatory ventilation [IMV]); cohort B was from 1993 to 1994 (use of synthetic surfactant, nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and conventional IMV); and cohort C was from 2000 to 2001 (use of natural surfactant, early nasal prong CPAP, synchronized IMV with tidal volume monitoring, and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was classified as mild, moderate, or severe. The mean gestational ages and birth weights were 28 and 3/7 weeks and 1120 g for cohort A, 30 and 0/7 weeks and 1340 g for cohort B, and 29 and 1/7 weeks and 1200 g for cohort C. The use of partial or complete courses of antenatal corticosteroids increased over time. There was a 50% reduction of mortality between each time period with mortality rates of 30%, 14%, and 7%, while the overall incidence of BPD was 26%, 11 %, and 19% in cohorts A, B, and C. Of note, moderate and severe forms of BPD decreased over time (11 %,3% , and 2%, respectively). Thus, changes in neonatal care of VLBW infants have resulted in dramatically improved survival rates over the past 15 years without increasing moderate to severe pulmonary morbidity.! 6 The pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is generally considered to be multifactorial. 17 The disease was first described in premature infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome who had been treated with high levels of oxygen (80% to 100%) and intermittent positive-pressure respirators for longer than 6 days. 12.13.18 Subsequent experimental studies have clearly demonstrated the toxic effects of prolonged exposure to high oxygen levels on the lungs of animals. 19 -23 Considered of equal importance by many is the role of barotrauma from artificial ventilation to the developing immature lung, contributing not only to the interstitial emphysema, pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum seen in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia but also directly injuring the acinus. 24 \u2022 25 While most cases follow the treatment of the RDS, others may occur following pneumonia, meconium aspiration syndrome, tracheoesophageal fistula, and congenital heart diseaseY The initiation of mechanical ventilation in surfactanttreated pre term animals causes a proinflammatory response, suggesting that any mechanical ventilation of the preterm lung may be injurious. 26 Inflammation appears to be central to the development of BPD. 14 Multiple proinflammatory and chemotactic factors are present in the air spaces of ventilated preterm infants, and these factors are found in higher concentrations in the air spaces of infants who subsequently develop BPDY Factors such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1 and interleukin (IL)-8 persist in the air spaces, and counterregulatory cytokines such as IL-10 may be decreased, resulting in unregulated and persistent inflammation. Infants exposed to antenatal infection/inflammation or fetal colonization with Ureaplasma urealyticum have proinflammatory indicators in their air spaces at delivery?8 The activation of inflammatory cascades can result in a vicious cycle of inflammation, which resolves slowly. Microbial infections (group B streptococcus, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Escherichia coli) activate nuclear factor KB (NF-KB), induce proinflammatory cytokine production, stimulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression and other inflammatory mediators in the host. 29 All these factors interact with each other. Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) can activate iNOS expression, promote ICAM-1 production, induce apoptosis, and upregulate NF-KB activation. After initial damage reparative processes begin that favor fibroproliferative changes in the lung. Several profibrotic factors such as transforming growth factor-~ (TGF-~), nitric oxide (NO), and VEGF have been shown to play roles in the development of chronic lung disease. This results in remodeling of lung tissue with disrupted lung morphology and architecture including interference with vascular and alveolar development.",

They concluded that the total pulmonary volume of endothelial cells, reflecting the size of the peripheral microvasculature network, of BPD lungs parallels or exceeds that of age-matched controls.

In experimental models, hyperoxia, hypoxia, or poor nutrition can decrease septation, as can glucocorticoid treatment. 32 In transgenic mice, overexpression of the cytokines TNF-a, TGF-~, IL-6, or IL-ll also can interfere with alveolarization, suggesting that the proinflammatory environment of the air space of the pre term infant may contribute to the altered septation. 33 Other factors involved in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia include pulmonary edema 34 and vitamin A deficiency. 35 The treatment of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia is primarily supportive, since once it develops, it cannot be reversed. Thus there is intense focus on developing preventive measures. The evolution of BPD from a disorder of pulmonary injury affecting moderately preterm infants to one characterized by a developmental pulmonary arrest among survivors of extreme prematurity has important implications for BPD prevention. Recent recognition that the pathogenesis of BPD might have prenatal origins raises new challenges and opportunities for studies of BPD prevention; however, most current preventative strategies for BPD focus on respiratory management. Neither past nor current clinical trials have shown a conclusive benefit of a single preventive treatment strategy. Promising but still largely unproven preventative respiratory treatments include high frequency oscillatory ventilation, permissive hypercapnia, and inhaled NO. Other areas to be studied are postnatal low-dose corticosteroid treatment, superoxide dismutase, inositol, and aI-proteinase inhibitor. Only vitamin A has proven a safe and effective preventive treatment for BPD. Directed cytokine and genetic therapies are on the horizon. 36 Survival of infants who develop severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associated with a 54% mortality and significant morbidity even in long-term survivors. Predictors of survival and outcome, not surprisingly, include degree of prematurity, duration of oxygen requirement, length of stay in the hospital, and severity of radiographic abnormalities. 37 The pathology of the lungs of infants with BPD has to be considered in the context of how the patient was treated. The classic changes of BPD are still seen in those not treated with surfactant and newer forms of ventilation (pre-surfactant BPD), whereas the treated patients who still develop severe enough BPD that results in death have an arrest in lung development. These two forms of BPD will be described separately.",

            "text": "The pathology of pre-surfactant bronchopulmonary dysplasia 38 ,39 varies considerably depending on (1) the gestational age of the infant, specifically, the degree of immaturity of the lung; (2) the type, duration, and peak (5) the presence of intercurrent processes such as pneumonia, interstitial emphysema, or pneumothorax. Detailed description of all these variations is beyond the scope of this chapter, but the major changes in gross morphology and changes within the airways and acini are described and summarized (Table  7 .1). These changes are divided into (1) acute, (2) reparative or healing, and (3) long-standing healed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In the acute stages of the disease, following typical changes of hyaline membrane disease in the first 3 to 4 days of life, the lungs are bulky, firm, and heavy, and often two to four times the expected weight ( Fig. 7 .5). The pink-to-tan pleura may be smooth or mildly irregular with areas of depressed or atelectatic parenchyma producing an uneven surface. Cut section displays a solid-appearing parenchyma that exudes fluid when compressed. By 1 to 2 weeks, the lungs begin to show a typical cobblestone surface with the development of an intricate sublobulation beneath the pleura representing alternating areas of atelectasis, interstitial fibroplasia, or hyperexpansion of acini ( Fig. 7.6 ). As the disease progresses to the healed stage at 1 to 3 months, this sublobulation becomes more accentuated with shallow and deep depressions dividing the lung into irregular lobules ( Fig.  7.7) . Some of these depressions may be large enough to be confused with the fissures between lobes of the lung. Hyperexpanded acini protrude from the surface of the lung with individual alveoli visible to the naked eye, implying an overexpansion of at least 5-to la-fold. Microscopically, the airways (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles) and gas-exchanging portions of the lung (alveolar ducts, saccules, and alveoli) undergo a series of acute changes followed by reparative processes that eventually lead to a static stage termed long-standing healed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 39 These changes will be considered in turn at each level of the lung ( Fig. 7.8) .",

Epithelial cells may appear dysplastic with enlarged nuclei. Focal mucosal necrosis, which may extend through the submucosa to the level of the tracheal cartilage rings, may occur and is possibly related to excessive pressure from an endotracheal tube. Acute and chronic inflammation in the submucosal connective tissue is usually present in varying degrees, and submucosal glands may be hypertrophied with dilated acini and ducts. In the reparative stages, the mucosa may undergo significant metaplastic changes eventually resembling noncornified stratified squamous epithelium, which is usually focal and noted predominantly in the lower trachea but may line the entire trachea extending into the ducts of the submucosal glands (Fig. 7.10 ). Chronic inflammation persists in the submucosa, and glands may display hyperplasia producing a Reid index of 40% to 60% that may persist into the healed stage. Focal fibrous and muscular hyperplasia in the lower trachea may produce epithelialcovered polyps that may narrow or rarely occlude the lumen. Bronchial changes in the acute, reparative, and healed stages are similar to those noted in the trachea (Fig. 7.11 ). First-or second-division bronchi display mucosal dysplasia and occasionally necrosis. The submucosa is often edematous and mildly infiltrated by acute inflammatory cells. Submucosal glands may be hypertrophied in early stages, but hyperplasia infrequently occurs and is usually mild or nonexistent in the healed phase. Muscular hyperplasia may develop in the reparative stage and persist in distal bronchi in the healed phase.",

These simplified acini are characterized by uniformly dilated alveoli whose walls consist of thin 185 FIGURE 7.17 . Pre-surfactant era long-standing healed bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 6 months.

A c A c FIGURE 7.19. Pre-surfactant era bronchopulmonary dysplasia. A. Three normal acini (A, B, C) arise from terminal bronchiole in this schematic drawing. B. In acute stages of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bronchiole leading to acinus A is occluded by material (hyaline membranes, necrotic debris, etc.), protecting acinus from ventilatory pressure and high oxygen tension. Bronchiole to acinus B is only partially occluded, allowing some injury to alveolar saccules and alveoli. Acinus C receives full ventilatory pressure and oxygen tension through widely patent alveolar septa with little or no interstitial fibrosis ( Fig.  7 .21). The bronchioles are similarly unremarkable, with only an occasional mild increase in peri bronchiolar musculature. These changes seem to represent an \"arrest\" of development of the acini, with a resulting markedly decreased number of alveoli within each acinus. As a result, the surface area of the lung is significantly decreased even in the absence of significant fibrosis or bronchiolitis. A c B bronchiole, allowing extensive damage (dysplasia, inflammation, fibroplasia) to alveolar saccules and alveoli. C. With resolution and healing, bronchiole in A is reopened allowing expansion (or overexpansion) of uninjured acinus. Acinus B displays interstitial fibrosis atypical of healed bronchopulmonary dysplasia; the most severely injured acinus C may partially or completely disappear, leading to contraction and fissuring of pleura.

Husain et a1. 45 A B c was infrequently seen in surfactant-treated BPD patients even though their disease was severe enough to be the underlying cause of their death. The RAC/MLI ratio (an indicator of the number of alveoli) in the BPD patients who lived weeks to months was virtually unchanged from that expected at the infants' birth. In other words, an infant born at 28 weeks' gestation who developed HMD and BPD and lived for 12 weeks, whether treated with surfactant or not, had the same number of alveoli as one born at 28 weeks' gestation and died immediately after birth.",

This allows air to leak into the septal connective tissue. 47 The air may remain localized to the septa, or dissect centrally along vessels to the mediastinum producing pneumomediastinum, or to the pericardium producing pneumopericardium, or peripherally to and through the pleura producing a pneumothorax. 48 Interstitial pulmonary emphysema had once been seen in as many as 20% of all preterm infants ventilated for the respiratory distress syndrome. But it has also been observed in low birth weight infants who breathed spontaneously and did not need mechanical ventilation 49 -51 or required only limited assistance such as nasal prong oxygen supplementation. 52 Interstitial pulmonary emphysema has also been noted following Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia,53 and, in a 15-year-old boy in association with a pulmonary metastasis from a synovial sarcoma. 54 Prior to the advent of surfactant therapy, infants weighing less than 1500 g showed an incidence of nearly 33 %, and infants weighing less than 1000 g showed an incidence as high as 42%? Mortality in these infants was higher (greater than 50%), again primarily (95%) in those infants with birth weights less than 1500 g (64 %) or who develop interstitial pulmonary emphysema on the first day of life (>75%). Since the advent of surfactant therapy and the use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, the incidence of interstitial pulmonary emphysema in premature infants has fallen dramatically,56--58 with one study noting an incidence of 6% in a group of 18 premature infants (median birth weight of 1010 g) vs. 39% in a control group of nonsurfactant, continuous positive airway pressure treated infants. 59 Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium frequently accompany interstitial pulmonary emphysema (40% to 77%) and contribute significantly to the mortality of preterm infants.6o Pneumothorax and interstitial pulmonary emphysema are also seen in fullterm infants, primarily in association with meconium aspiration 61 or pulmonary hypoplasia.",

If interstitial pulmonary emphysema persists, radiographs may display an expanded multicystic pattern of one or more lobes. If it is localized to one lung, mediastinal shift and depression of the diaphragm may occur. Compression atelectasis of lung adjacent to the cysts will further accentuate the air-filled spaces. 63 Solitary unilocular cysts of the lung may be seen with persistence of acute interstitial pulmonary emphysema even if the initial episode of interstitial emphysema is undetected for days or weeks. 64 The treatment of infants with bilateral interstitial pulmonary emphysema is difficult and varied. Reduction in ventilatory pressures is effective and alleviates the influx of air into interstitial tissues but may also prove inadequate to ventilate the infant. High-frequency ventilation has been shown to be helpful in these infants. Many modes of therapy have been employed in the treatment of infants with persistent unilateral interstitial pulmonary emphysema, including selective bronchial intubation, lateral decubitus positioning, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, alveolar lavage during flexible bronchoscopy, artificial pneumothorax and pneumonotomy,partial liquid ventilation,65 and lobectomy.46 Persistent interstitial pulmonary emphysema in recent years has become 189 an indication for pulmonary resection in the newborn period. 62 Interstitial pulmonary emphysema pathologically occurs in two forms (Table 7. 2): an acute usually diffuse form noted in the first few days of life, and a persistent form seen in either a localized or diffuse pattern in infants more than 1 week old. 46 \u2022 66 Acute interstitial pulmonary emphysema (AIPE) appears grossly as round-to-oval gas-filled spaces around bronchovascular bundles or along interlobular septa ( Fig.  7 .23). These spaces are usually visible beneath the pleura but are almost always limited to those areas in which the interlobular septa extend to the pleura. This is a major reason for establishing that the gas, for the most part, is within the connective tissue of the interlobular spaces rather than within lymphatics, which could lead to a lateral distribution of air within subpleurallymphatics. 46 The parenchyma adjacent to the interstitial pulmonary emphysema is often atelectatic and firmer than areas of uninvolved lung.",

As previously mentioned, interstitial air is rarely seen in the subpleural region except for the area in direct continuity with the interlobular septum. In cases of bronchopulmonary dysplasia with AIPE or PIPE, the large subpleural lymphatic bed is uninvolved and in most cases appears virtually normal.

Hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells and bronchial epithelial cells was noted after 2 days of ECMO therapy in some patients and by 7 days in all patients. Bronchial epithelium displayed squamous metaplasia in most cases. Clusters of calcified material were noted in the alveoli of 7 of 23 cases. Interstitial fibrosis was a consistent finding after 7 days of ECMO therapy. In three patients treated for 15, 19, and 21 days, there was replacement of the terminal airways and alveoli by tall columnar and mucin-producing epithelium. 83 Pulmonary Hemorrhage Hemorrhage into the alveoli or interstitium of the lung is a rather common histologic finding at autopsy or in tissue removed at surgery for various reasons. In the latter situation, one must remember the possibility that intraoperative manipulation may have produced the hemorrhage.

The alveolar hemorrhage syndromes include Goodpasture syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, the collagen vascular diseases complicated by hemorrhage, and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis. 88 The designation pulmonary renal syndromes has been applied as a collective appellation to this same basic group of diseases with the exception of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis. 89 In the pediatric age population, the concerns are mainly focused on neonatal pulmonary hemorrhage and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis.",

The changes on the chest radiograph are generally nonspecific. Herein lies the problem of massive pulmonary hemorrhage and whether there is such a specific entity. An unmistakable impression from recent studies is that massive pulmonary hemorrhage is a diagnosis of exclusion, because there are other conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure that produce a clinic oradiologic picture of massive pulmonary hemorrhage. 193 The estimated frequency of massive pulmonary hemorrhage in neonates is 0.1 % of live births, a figure derived from the British Perinatal Mortality survey.90 This incidence increases dramatically to 5% to 7% in VLBW infants with respiratory distress. 85 As viewed from the perspective of an autopsy finding in neonates, the frequency of pulmonary hemorrhage is more difficult to assess since the quantitative aspects may not be explicitly addressed in each published study. Hanzlick,9! however, examined infant lung samples (four sections/cases) obtained by medical examiner pathologists from infants dying from forensic and nonforensic causes. The lung sections were scored as to the extent of alveolar hemorrhage on a scale of 0 to 7.

Since most studies are drawn from autopsy experiences, the conclusion might be made that massive pulmonary hemorrhage is universally fatal. However, there are, more recently, reports of survivors who have been treated with high-frequency ventilation or activated recombinant factor VII. 85 . 97 As with many diseases in infancy, massive pulmonary hemorrhage might best be treated by preventing the situations that lead to the hemorrhage, for example, surfactant replacement in premature infants to prevent hypoxia and alveolar cell damage. 102.103 Hemorrhage producing consolidation of at least two lobes of the lung is a definition of massive pulmonary hemorrhage that was proposed by Esterly and Oppenheimer lO4 in their classic study. They emphasized the confluent nature of the hemorrhage, although focal areas of more normal-appearing parenchyma may be identi- that the blood was a plasma filtrate. Microscopically, the hemorrhage is typically found in the alveoli and interstitium; however, the alveolar extravasation is generally more apparent than the interstitial hemorrhage ( Fig.  7.28 ). Many alveoli, in addition to the blood, contain palely staining fluid that is the predominant finding in some fields. The interlobar septa are often widened as the result of hemorrhage and edema. It is often difficult to be certain whether the changes in the alveolar septa are congestion or actual extravasation. When an area of lung is collapsed, there are further problems in the interpretation of the microscopic findings.",

Subsequently deficiencies of surfactant proteins Band C have been reported. [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] [144] Inherited deficiency of surfactant protein B (SP-B) is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder of lung cell metabolism caused most frequently by a frameshift mutation in codon 121 of the SP-B gene (l2lins2) with an approximate gene frequency of 1 in 3000 to 5000 individuals. 145 The disease is characterized by rapidly progressive respiratory failure immediately after birth associated with a diffuse ground-glass appearance to the lungs radiographically along with markedly prominent interlobular septa. 146 ,147 Other novel mutation sites have also been described. 148 Chorionic villous sampling can be used to identify the homozygous state in utero. 149 Less frequently, abnormalities of surfactant proteins A and C may occur in association with SP-B deficiency,l50-152 but only recently had a true deficiency state of surfactant protein C been described.153.154 Lung transplantation has been successful, although patients may develop an antisurfactant protein antibody. 155 Grossly the lungs in congenital surfactant deficiency are heavy and appear consolidated. Microscopically in the early stages, alveoli are lined by a continuous layer of cuboidal alveolar lining cells (Fig. 7.32 ). As the disease progresses, alveoli may be filled with eosinophilic granular material admixed with desquamated alveolar cells and macrophages resembling congenital alveolar proteinosis ( Fig. 7.33 ). In the later stages, alveolar septa are widened by fibroblasts producing alveolar septal fibrosis, although the alveolar cell hyperplasia persists (Fig. 7.34 ). Immunohistochemical stains of type II alveolar lining cells with SP-B or -C may be used to establish the appropriate deficiency state. ",

In the latter case, the distinction between a congenital and perinatal infection is not always possible or necessary. A perinatal infection may be generalized or localized to one system, in contrast to a congenital infection, which is usually systemic and may have teratogenic effects if it occurs early in development. Congenital pneumonia secondary to an organism crossing the placenta is well documented or strongly suggested for the following pathogens: cytomegalovirus, rubella, herpes simplex, Toxoplasma gondii, coxsackie virus B, Treponema pallidum, and Listeria monocytogenes. 157 Vaginal flora gain access to the amniotic sac with prolonged rupture of membranes and produce chorioamnionitis with or without an acquired congenital pneumonia; these organisms include various gram-negative coliform bacteria, Candida albicans, L. monocytogenes, and group B ~-hemolytic streptococcus. Delivery through an infected birth canal may expose the infant not only to the aforementioned organisms but also to cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, S. aureus, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma, and Mycoplasma. 1S7 Aspiration of these organisms into the respiratory tract or sepsis is B the mode of infection.

Five (15%) of the cases had an evident history of being exposed to a SARS patient before the symptoms occurred. The clinical features included fever (100%), often higher that 39\u00b0C, and cough (91 % ), both productive and nonproductive. The white blood count was normal or low in 67% of the cases. The predominant cell was the lymphocyte. Chest radiographs showed rapidly changing patchy infiltrates, with both unilateral and bilateral involvement. Supportive treatment included isolation and antibiotics to prevent bacterial infection, and resulted in the recovery of all the children. 261 The lung pathology, fortunately, is rarely seen in children because of their frequent recovery. However, in 203 adults who have died, diffuse alveolar damage is commonly seen, with other morphologic changes including bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia. 256 Less frequent findings include giantcell infiltrate, pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung, and hemophagocytosis. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells corresponding to coronavirus (see also Chapter 11) . 256 Human Immunodeficiency Virus Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the eventual consequence in most individuals of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 or, infrequently, HIV-2) infection. Approximately 2% of all reported AIDS cases in the United States are diagnosed in individuals younger than 13 years old. 262 The overwhelming majority of pediatric cases (80% to 90%) throughout the world are recognized in children 2 years old or younger who had acquired HIV through vertical transmission from an infected mother. 263 In countries where appropriate treatment of the mother is available, the rate have fallen to as low as 2%.264-266 Some infants are seemingly infected in utero, but other neonates may acquire the virus intra-or peripartum. Even though the virus is transmitted across the placenta in some or most cases, neither villitis nor other pathologic evidence of infection, including pneumonia, has been documented in the fetus or neonate. 267 The remaining HIV-AIDS cases in the pediatric age popUlation are the results of an infected blood transfusion (uncommon in the United States) or sexual contact with a HIV-infected individual; these patients are more commonly older children or adolescents.",

This section is concerned principally with those infections that are acquired perinatally and are manifested in the first days or weeks of life. Most of these infections are ultimately traced to the mother, and occasionally to the father. Mothers can infect their children postnatally, but extramaternal sources (the nursery and its personnel, mechanical devices, and other family members) are important in the etiology of neonatal pneumonias. The incidence of pneumonia is particularly high in premature infants in the presence of chorioamnionitis. 276 Group B ~-Hemolytic Streptococcus Two bacteria, group B p-hemolytic streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli, are together responsible for the majority of cases of neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. 277 The overall incidence of GBS disease is 2 to 3 cases per 1,000 live births; premature or low-weightfor-date infants have an even greater risk of infection. 278 There is a correlation between the degree of cervicovaginal colonization and the acquisition rate of GBS disease in the neonate.279 Prolonged rupture of membranes and low birth weight enhance the risk for infection. Earlyonset GBS disease in the first day of life is characterized by symptoms and signs of respiratory distress and radiographic changes resembling early BPD. The infection evolves very rapidly and terminates in death in 50% to 75% of cases unless quickly diagnosed and appropriately treated. When GBS disease has a delayed onset, the prognosis is more favorable. 280 A documented association of GBS disease is the delay in the clinical presentation of a right-sided diaphragmatic hernia. 281 ,282 The pathologic findings of GBS in the lungs ( 7. Acquired Nonneoplastic Neonatal and Pediatric Diseases similar to BPD with a hypoaerated appearance and widespread HMs in underexpanded air spaces. Diffuse alveolar and interstitial hemorrhage simulates massive pulmonary hemorrhage of the newborn. There is a minimal neutrophilic infiltrate in the first few hours of the infection; the Gram stain shows clumps of gram-positive cocci in the air spaces and within the HMs, and appropriate bacteriologic cultures establish the diagnosis. Antibiotic therapy may interfere with the results of culture and the demonstration of the bacteria. A focal or confluent neutrophilic exudate in the alveoli is present in the lungs of infants who survive 12 to 24 hours. Abscesses are usually not found.",

Occluded pulmonary vessels in the region of an infarct are often highlighted by a dense tangle of pseudohyphae invading the vessel wall in a similar manner as does Aspergillus or Mucor. Microabscesses with a minimal exudative component and rarely a granulomatous reaction are the features of capillary invasive candidiasis. An occasional case has more than one pattern of pulmonary involvement by Candida, or several simultaneous processes may be present as well, including BPD and secondary bacterial A B pneumonia. Separation of the various pathologic findings in the lung is a difficult and complicated problem that is best approached with a thorough knowledge of the clinical events (see also Chapter 10).",

Foci of acute bronchopneumonia Two patients, a 36-year-old woman and a 69-year-old man, developed squamous cell carcinoma within an intralobar sequestration. 367 Because of the presence of one or more systemic arteries to an intralobar sequestration, the lesion has long been considered to be a congenital malformation (Table  7 .5). Gebauer and Mason 368 in 1959, however, suggested that intralobar sequestration resulted from a \"destructive bronchial pulmonary disease.\" In 1984, Stocker and Malczak 369 described the presence of normally occurring pulmonary ligament arteries in 90% of infants and children, and postulated that these arteries could be parasitized in the formation of an intralobar sequestration (Fig.  7.51 ). Under circumstances of bronchial obstruction and a chronic pneumonia with partial or complete interruption of the pulmonary artery supply to the infected portion, parasitization could occur through the development of a pleuritis and formation of a richly vascular granulation tissue deriving its blood supply from the hypertrophied pulmonary ligament arteries or, if the diaphragmatic surface of the lung is involved, the diaphragmatic vessels, that is, the phrenic arteries via the celiac axis ( Fig. 7.52) .",

The lack of systemic arteries other than the bronchial arteries available for parasitization by a chronic upper-lobe pneumonia accounts for the rare occurrence of intralobar sequestration in the upper lobes (less than 2% and likely overreported because of their rarity). Chronic pneumonia of the upper lobes, histologically similar to intralobar sequestration, is not, however, an unusual occurrence. 8 with blue latex, dissection through the pulmonary ligament artery to the right lower lobe reveals a very small artery rising from the aorta (left) supplying the esophagus and ramifying in the pleura. c FIGURE 7.52.

The data accumulated from pediatric recipients indicates that the pathology of rejection is similar or identical to that in older patients. However, there are significant differences in primary diseases, size of the allograft, repeat hospitalization, recurrent disease, impact on growth and development, and mortality. 376 Eighty-five percent of pediatric recipients are between 11 and 17 years of age, with the nadir between 2 and 7 years of age. Among the younger aged pediatric recipients, the first year of life is the most likely time for lung transplantation. In the infant age group, congenital heart disease was the most common indication for lung transplantation, but thereafter the most common indication is cystic fibrosis (67% of adolescents). Other indications include pulmonary hypertension, interstitial fibrosis, and bronchiolitis obliterans. 375 The increasing scarcity of donor lungs, especially for pediatric recipients, has stimulated the developmen~ of downsizing techniques (split lung, lobar and periph,;ral segmental transplantation) of cadaveric lungs, which have proven to be reliable procedures providing equal results compared to standard lung transplantation. 377 In addition, living-donor lobar lung transplantation has also provided organs for patients considered too ill to await cadaveric transplantation, with at least comparable if not better survival. 378 ,379 Transbronchial biopsies are an integral part of the posttransplant monitoring for rejection or infection, and adequate lung tissue for histologic diagnosis can be obtained safely and effectively from pediatric patients of all ages via flexible bronchoscopy. 380 The histology of both acute and chronic lung rejection is similar to that seen in adults, and the 1996 Working Formulation for the Classification of Pulmonary Allograft Rejection is used for grading (see Chapter 23).381 Morbidity is common after pediatric lung transplantation, with these patients being at high risk for developing graft failure, adenoviral pneumonia and other infections, diabetes, hypertension, and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). Bronchiolitis obliterans continues to be the leading cause of late morbidity and mortality, with only 45% of 5-year survivors being free of disease. 375 ,382 Because of the nature of indications for pediatric lung transplantation, recurrence of primary disease in the allograft is not an issue (in contrast to adults, e.g., sarcoidosis). 217 The outcome after pediatric lung transplantation has not improved significantly over the last 15 years, except for the trend toward increased survival in infants. Overall pediatric survival is 66% at 1 year,57% at 2 years, 48% at 3 years, and 31 % at 9 years. 374 ,383",

Luminal exudate in the bronchioles, peribronchiolar lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, interstitial mononuclear infiltrate, and alveolar damage are characteristic features. Wang et al.,297 however, reported five children who had a prolonged fever and severe respiratory distress, and had developed a necrotizing pneumonia. Kim et al. 298 also noted bronchiolitis obliterans in young patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. The Swyer-James syndrome (unilateral hyperlucent lung) has also been described following an infection (see Chapter 25).299 Mycobacterium tuberculosis hominis Tuberculosis has always been prevalent in the less developed countries of the world, where it is endemic. In the United States, tuberculosis was until recently regarded as a disease under control; however, the status quo has been altered substantially, in part because of the growing number of new cases in HIV-infected individuals. 300 .3 01 New cases of tuberculosis in children are most prevalent in those under 5 years of age302.303; most of these infections are airborne spread.Infrequent examples of congenital tuberculosis have been documented and defined by active maternal disease and a primary complex in the liver of the infant.304 Machin and associates 305 reported their experience with perinatally acquired tuberculosis and summarized the previous 13 cases in the literature.
