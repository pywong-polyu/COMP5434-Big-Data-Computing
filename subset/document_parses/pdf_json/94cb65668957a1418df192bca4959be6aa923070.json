Our case highlights the importance of clinical awareness regarding this novel disease and the importance of close coordination between providers and public health authorities.",

He reported being in contact with his co-worker at a restaurant about two weeks ago who had similar symptoms. He also reported recent travel to Philadelphia a month prior to admission. Presenting vital signs were notable for temperature of 102F, respiratory rate of 39, and oxygen saturation of 85% on room air while rest of the vital signs were within normal limits. Physical exam was notable for inspiratory crackles and diffuse rhonchi in bilateral lung fields. He was placed on high flow nasal cannula at 80% FiO2 and 40L/min flow. Lab workup revealed mild hyponatremia and mild hypokalemia while rest of the labs including CBC, lactic acid, procalcitonin, and troponin was unremarkable. Chest CTA was notable for diffuse patchy consolidation and was negative for pulmonary embolism. (Image 1) He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and COVID-19 testing was sent out to department of health which resulted positive. He was gradually weaned off oxygen. He was discharged home with selfquarantine for 14 days.",

Complications such as severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiac injury have been reported.(1, 3, 8) Chest CT is a vital component in the diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. The hallmarks of COVID-19 infection on imaging include bilateral and peripheral ground-glass and consolidative opacities.(9) Other CT findings include smooth or irregular interlobular septa thickening, air bronchogram, crazy-paving pattern, bronchiectasis, pleural effusion, linear opacities, and the reverse halo sign.(9, 10) Our case is unique as the patient's CT scan displayed bilateral consolidation without ground-glass opacities which is only reported in 2% of the patients. (9) CONCLUSIONS: Our case highlights the importance of early recognition of various clinical and radiographic presentation of COVID-19.",
