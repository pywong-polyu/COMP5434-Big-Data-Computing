The topics included in the call for papers were the interaction of psychosocial well-being and mental health with economic, gender, racial and ethnic inequalities, migration and demographic change and conflict and war, as well as the effects of stigma on people discriminated against because of their differential characteristics, whether they are of a sexual, disability or other minority. We made this proposal because we believed that, despite the introduction of the biopsychosocial model in the late 1970s as a paradigm of the integration of different disciplinary views, research in mental health and psychosocial well-being is still highly fragmented. For decades, we have tried to advance by emphasizing a part of the equation, with results that are at least modest. Therefore, in this Special Issue, we prioritized works aiming at disciplinary and methodological integration. The Special Issue was open to any subject area related to the impacts of social issues on mental health and psychosocial well-being. We were interested in empirical and theoretical enquiries at all ecological levels, from the psychosocial impact of social dynamics on individuals, to the analysis of how sociocultural and geopolitical factors influence health and collective psychosocial well-being.",

It is difficult to find events in history that have affected all humanity in such a global way and that, at the same time, have revealed so clearly the healthcare disparities existing in our societies.

We could say that the current pandemic has made contextualization mainstream. But what does the pandemic really imply in terms of psychosocial well-being? The intensification of the exclusion conditions of the less favored, extreme pressure on health and supply services workers, a lack of perspective for young generations, the proliferation of conspiracy theories that could hinder the implementation of solutions, etc. It is clearly not the first time that these circumstances have happened, some are typical of more localized emergencies such as natural disasters, so perhaps the novelty lies in that it has happened at almost the same time for all humanity.",

However, the debate on the need for the contextualization of psychological research has long been fraught with controversy. The debate has always been between those who believe that theories and their applications should be anchored in history, ideologies, and social power relations and those who rather opt for universalistic applications. The latter, in our opinion dominant in the areas of mental health and well-being research, can be perceived as pragmatic or, on the contrary, decontextualized by the former. The reality is that the promotion of psychosocial well-being with formulas that do not sufficiently consider the state of the recipients in terms of their status of social power (i.e., if they are object of stigmatization and exclusion or on the contrary, enjoy a privileged status compared to other groups), is common. These are uncomfortable topics, which are not usually covered in depth in handbooks dedicated to the conceptual understanding or the application of techniques to increase well-being.",

Data from 90 caretakers were subjected to principal component and reliability analyses. The Polish version of the instrument demonstrated good internal consistency and congruent validity. The authors conclude that the Polish version of the shortened version of the questionnaire is similarly valid compared to the original English version and is suitable for use within this population.",

Their results show significant gender differences. Men had more leisure time, but women had a more positive leisure experience and time perspective than men. The authors concluded that women enjoy themselves more with less available leisure time and are more positive regarding time orientations.",

They also investigated the association between social capital and subjective well-being. Older restoration public housing residents may demonstrate lower social capital and health indicators after the earthquake. Mistrust was found to be positively associated with low subjective well-being in these residents. The authors propose that future studies should examine the relationship between subjective well-being and social capital, as well as the effectiveness of support for enhancing the trust of older restoration public housing residents regarding the involvement of scientists and practitioners in promoting subjective well-being.",

Spanish employees aged over 40 (n = 741), were recruited in two waves with a 4-month interval. Their results support the hypothesis that psychological capital resources may play a mediating role in the relationship between motivational traits and performance in the form of extra-role behaviors (both positive and negative for the company) and that approach orientation traits are mainly related to a better performance, fostering organizational citizenship behaviors and diminishing counterproductive work behavior. The findings show that employees who develop their personal resources may have a positive impact on their organizations. One way of developing employee motivation at a cognitive level would be to understand situations more positively, reinforcing ideas of approach over those of avoidance. A clear implication of the study is that every employee should be treated according to their personal needs and that one-size-fits-all approaches are not effective. ",

These relationships might depend on power imbalances caused by gender, economic, ethnic or ability inequalities. Researchers interested in understanding psychosocial well-being must consider the contexts they study and the complexity of the multiple interactions that can occur in them. Although there may be universal relationships, it is important not to take this for granted when conducting research outside mainstream study populations. What works for a wealthy white Caucasian male in terms of self-efficacy, locus of control, sense of coherence, etc., might not be the same for people of other cultures, with different worldviews and/or are subjected to any kind of injustice. Last, but not least, the beliefs and attitudes of researchers and practitioners should be both an object of study and an element of reflection. No one is free from prejudice, even if using supposedly \"objective\" methods. Awareness of and reflection on the possible biases of our research and practice methods are the only way to reduce bad practices caused by prejudices.",
