Some recent studies have found neither an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in IBD patients, nor an association between immunosuppressive therapies and an increased risk of clinically manifest COVID-19 [12] [13] [14] .

Recently, SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody dynamics following initial infection were described among 45 non-IBD patients, and IgG development was 96.7% at 37 days postexposure [21] . In the said study, no further description of comorbidities or concomitant medication was given. One of the first studies to report specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies observed the outcome of 34 hospitalized patients with a total observation time of 7 weeks. At the end, all patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers, whereas two patients (33.3%) had negative IgM antibodies [22] .",

On the other hand, it is well known that the serological response rate to immunization in immunocompromised patients might be lower, for example for hepatitis B [25] . A study by Altunoz et al. showed that patients with IBD under immunosuppression (corticosteroids, azathioprine and anti-TNF) develop lower protective anti-HBs titers; further studies have also confirmed such findings [26, 27] . Similarly, response rates to pneumococcal vaccination are significantly lower when patients received anti-TNF therapy alone or in combination with azathioprine, in comparison to the group which only received mesalamine [28] . This has led to the recommendation to vaccinate patients prior to initiating immunosuppressive treatment. Contrarily, a study comparing measles, mumps and rubella vaccine-induced antibody concentrations in a cohort of IBD patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment found comparable results to healthy controls [29] .",
