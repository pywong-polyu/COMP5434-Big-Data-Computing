Lincoln Community Health Center, our urban Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), aimed to use hypertension self-management classes to improve hypertension control among our clinic patients, particularly Black men. Patients attending classes learned about hypertension, were given blood pressure cuffs to use at home, and had the opportunity to speak to physicians in a group setting. We used a nonexperimental quality improvement intervention design to identify baseline differences between participants who attended multiple classes and those who attended only 1 class. Participants who attended multiple classes, most of whom were Black men, achieved an average blood pressure reduction of 19.1/14.8 mm Hg. Although the classes were effective, current policies around health insurance reimbursement and federal quality reporting standards hamper the ability of health care providers to implement such patient education initiatives.",

First, current insurance reimbursement policies offer no incentives for clinicians to offer education classes. Private insurers still largely operate on a feefor-service model that offers no support for educational interventions. Medicare reimburses FQHCs by patient visit by using the FQHC Prospective Payment System, which is tied to the cost of care and is updated annually. Medicaid reimbursement varies state-by-state but historically has not been tied to the quality of care provided. The revenue stream from which funds for education activities would likely come is Federal Section 330 funding, which typically goes toward covering care for the uninsured and for nonclinical services such as transportation. However, these funds are probably insufficient to cover new chronic disease management programs, especially during an economic period of declining health insurance coverage.",
