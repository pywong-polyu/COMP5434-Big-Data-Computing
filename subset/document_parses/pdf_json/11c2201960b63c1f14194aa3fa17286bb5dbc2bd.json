            "text": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication that may lead to retinal vascular damage and is one of the leading causes of vision impairment and blindness. DR broadly is classified into two stages -non-proliferative (NPDR), where there are almost no symptoms, except a few microaneurysms, and proliferative (PDR) involving a huge number of microaneurysms and hemorrhages, soft and hard exudates, neo-vascularization, macular ischemia or a combination of these, making it easier to detect. More specifically, DR is usually classified into five levels, labeled 0-4, from 0 indicating no DR to 4 which is most severe. This paper firstly presents a discussion on the risk factors of the disease, then surveys the recent literature on the topic followed by examining certain techniques which were found to be highly effective in improving the prognosis accuracy. Finally, a convolutional neural network model is proposed to detect all the stages of DR on a low-memory edge microcontroller. The model has a size of just 5.9 MB, accuracy and F1 score both of 94% and an inference speed of about 20 frames per second.",

These numbers are reaching epidemic levels, with previous estimates of around 439 million DM patients by 2030 [2] and 600 million by 2040, skyrocketing to more recent estimates of 578 million (10.2%) by 2030 and a whopping 700 million (10.9%) by 2045, according to the diabetes Atlas 2019 [3] . About a third of these diabetes patients are expected to have Diabetic Retinopathy [4] . In India, the number of diabetes patients increased from 26 million in 1990 to 65 million in 2016 [5] and is fast increasing.

Depth resolution could be achieved by viewing the retina from different angles, as carried out in stereo fundus photography, multiple wavelength bands could be used which is called hyperspectral imaging.

The solution file contained the labels for the test images as well. Both the train and test datasets were combined to get a larger dataset of 88702 images, the distribution of which is given below in Fig. 2 . The weightage per class is observed to be about 73.7%, 14.8%, 6.9%, 2.3% and 2.1% respectively. Due to this high skew in the train set, along with the intention to develop an algorithm that can robustly classify on less data at the edge, only 1910 images per class were selected, which is about 10% of the initial merged dataset. Each of these 1910 images per class were split into 1600 images for training, 119 for validation and 191 for test. Thus, the final set had 8000 images for training, 595 images for validation 955 images for testing the model.

On the 175 th epoch, a drop in learning rate from 1.8 to 0.18 causes the model to converge faster, and accuracy jumps from 84 to 88%. Confusion matrices and performance metrics were calculated for both the initial and the quantized model, and have been presented in Fig. 11 and Table 1 for the float32 model and in Fig. 12 and Table 2 for the int8 model, giving the reader a detailed understanding of model performance.
