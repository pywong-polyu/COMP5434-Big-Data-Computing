In most countries, the epidemic was controlled in spring 2020 by restrictive measures such as travel bans and closures of non-essential businesses and educational establishments. By mid-April 2020, 94% of learners worldwide were affected by the pandemic, representing 1.58 billion children and youth (C&Y), from pre-primary to higher education, in 200 countries [1] . Although school closures may help control the epidemic [2] , they result in significant detrimental effects, including affecting children's learning and mental health, placing a high burden on the parents and reducing economic productivity [3] . Hence, policymakers worldwide have had to make difficult decisions about whether and how to reopen schools over the past several months. To date, there has been no easy answer or single standard [4] .",

These include effective and rapid case detection with isolation of cases, effective and rapid contact tracing and quarantine of contacts, and maintenance of physical distancing and mask-wearing by the public [5] [6] [7] . Many countries reopened schools during late summer and early autumn 2020, adapting multiple control measures, such as cohorting approaches, distantiated single desks, as well as use of masks and hand sanitizer [8, 9] . Risk mitigation measures in schools such as daily self-screening for symptoms and virtual attendance [10] were also enacted to help minimize infections in school-aged children and subsequent transmission of infections acquired in schools into the wider community. Still, the effectiveness of these and other mitigation strategies has yet to be examined.",

            "text": "The efficiency of school closures to mitigate infectious disease, including COVID-19, has been widely studied [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, school closure is not a long-term solution, thus the safe reopening of schools is of critical importance to policymakers. Some studies have suggested that autumn 2020 was too soon to reopen schools [19] , while others noted that with strict control of community transmission, schools have only a modest impact on virus spread [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Other measures, such as widespread testing, contact tracing and case isolation [3, [25] [26] [27] , as well as mitigation strategies including pre-semester screening [28] and household quarantine [27, 29] , may enable safe school reopening. For example, a recent study found that screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (greater than 70%) test, coupled with strict behavioural rules, was estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campuses [18] . At the same time, it has been proposed that without strengthening NPIs, school reopening can contribute to secondary waves [3, 27] . In addition, there is substantial evidence of secondary infections among household contacts [30] [31] [32] [33] . In Toronto, household transmission is a key source of infection among C&Y, accounting for 20.5% of total infections, second only to community transmission [33] . While previous studies have highlighted the important role of school reopening in the trajectory of COVID-19, the transmission of infections acquired in schools into the wider community via transmission in households with children has not been examined. Furthermore, to date, there has been no literature on whether the resurgence of COVID-19 was driven by increases in contacts between C&Y and/or adults.",

Asymptomatic infections represent infections with no symptoms for the whole infection period. The population is classified into adults (20+) and C&Y (0-19), labelled as a,c, respectively. The model also incorporates additional complexity by including location structure (home, schools and community) and household structure (average household size, with/without children). There is evidence suggesting that work from home may reduce the risk of transmission [36, 39] . Fisher et al. [36] , for example, found that adults who received positive test results for COVID-19 were more likely to report going to an office or school setting, compared with those who tested negative [36] . Belzunegui-Eraso & Erro-Garc\u00e9s [39] suggested teleworking as a measure to reduce COVID-19 transmission [39] . Hence, we further classify households as those where adults are working-from-home (WFH, in subscript q), with no social activity, or working-outside-of-home (WOH, in subscript g), with social activities in the community. The WFH households can convert to the WOH households following school reopening.",

The household transmission is limited within household members and there is no household transmission if all the household members are not infected. The situation may change with the movement of individuals between the community, home and school. The individuals in WFH household all are assumed to be susceptible and isolated. The populations outside of household are composed of C&Y in the school and adults in the community both from WOH household, and the school transmission and community transmission are involved. The school transmission can occur when the school operated in the given schedule, while the household transmission and community transmission can occur Due to the influence of many factors such as people's personal characteristics, views on the epidemic, work types and household types, not all households will send C&Y back to school after the reopening, since inperson school attendance was optional. People need time to respond to the government policy, and they may gradually follow the policy. We assume that the process of C&Y returning to school and adults returning to work follows an exponential distribution [29] after schools opening on 8 September 2020, as we consider the returning behaviours of each household is a random event. Then we obtained the returning (back to school) rate of C&Y. The detailed definition of returning rate can be found in electronic supplementary material, \u00a73.1. We modelled transmission over two periods: before and after schools reopened on 8 September 2020 [40] . Prior to school reopening, we assumed that all WFH individuals are susceptible, but, once C&Y go back to school, adults may return to work transitioning from WFH to WOH. While schools were closed, C&Y were at risk solely from infection in their household; however, after schools reopened, C&Y attending school in-person faced further risk of infection from within the school. If C&Y were also part of a WOH household, the risk of infection was possible from both family members and the community. Similarly, adults could have been infected by household members including children, or, if belonging to WOH, from the community as well. We additionally accounted for the impact of control measures specific to the school setting on transmission, including quarantine and contact tracing of school cases, mandatory self-screening procedures, and optional in-person attendance. The detailed model assumptions are presented in table 2. Also, the infectiousness among C&Y aged less than 19 years is assumed to be 50% of infectiousness in adults, based on available research suggesting lower susceptibility among children [3, 41, 42] . The contact matrix between adults and C&Y in the community is assumed to be symmetrical. The assumptions of the transmission risk in different locations are also defined in table 3. In addition, to mimic the transmission in the school, we included the school schedules into the model as there are no school transmissions during the weekend. Hence, our ODE model was solved within each day (split into 24 h).",

Given the importance of household transmission [27, [29] [30] [31] [32] , we classified the households into different types based on the disease state of adults and C&Y in each household. The number of certain types of households (e.g. the household of two susceptible adults, one exposed C&Y) will change over time due to the dynamic of the epidemic in the household. We further calculated the variation in the number of different types of WOH households with different trajectories of disease progression, within-household transmission, transmission in the community and school, and the transition from WFH households to WOH households due to school reopening. The change rate of individuals in the WOH household can be calculated via the sum of the change rate of those individuals from all types of WOH households.",

Hence, in our model, there is no separation of adult populations into younger or older groups, and the school setting does not include adults, such as teachers and staff. The contacts between adults and C&Y in schools after school opened were considered through increases in the community (table 3 ). In addition, we distinguish households with and without C&Y in the degree of involvement in school transmission. The C&Y population in the model is informed by census data on the proportion of households with C&Y and the average household size in Toronto. As such, it may be underestimated due to the existence of the household of lone parents with one or more children or couples with two or more children. However, given that households with one person account for 32.34% of total Toronto households [35] , this may overestimate the transmission risk in the household. Owing to these two possibilities, our method of modelling population composition should be appropriate and reasonable. It ",

Looking at the transmission risk levels across these scenarios, it is evident that the highest and sharpest increase of cases after 8 September 2020 occurs under scenario 2 conditions (orange lines), whereby indoor dining and gatherings are allowed, regardless of whether schools are open or closed, followed by scenario 1 (blue lines), scenario 4 ( purple lines) and scenario 3 (green lines), where indoor gatherings are not allowed, and retail is restricted. However, regardless of community restriction levels, opening schools results in only a slight increase in cases among adults and C&Y, with a more pronounced increase in C&Y. Figure 3 shows that case numbers are relatively unchanged between opening and closing schools in each scenario. Thus, our model revealed that school reopening is not the key to outbreak resurgence, but rather it is the risk of transmission in the community that determines the trend of the epidemic. When community transmission is low, safe school opening is feasible ( figure 3, green lines) , under strict NPIs measures. By contrast, an exponentially increasing epidemic occurs irrespective of whether schools are closed or open with high community transmission risk due to weak NPIs (figure 3, orange lines).",

In communities with higher home transmission probabilities (for example, those with a larger average household size), there is a higher risk of an epidemic rebound when schools are open. By contrast, with a per contact transmission probability of 4.1% (for the wildtype variant observed on 5 October 2020), in communities with a lower risk of infection at home (0.5%), controlling the contact rate of adults below three can keep the R t of adults and C&Y below one at four weeks following reopening ( figure 4a,b) . Safe school reopening requires not only low contact rate, but also a reduction in the per-contact transmission probability. When the per-contact transmission probability increases to more than 4.8%, which could be a result of weaker adherence to self-protective behaviours or a result of the introduction new variants with more infectious transmissibility, it is difficult to prevent epidemic resurgence even with a low contact rate (less than three) among adults, regardless of schools being open or closed (figure 4c,d; electronic supplementary material, figure S3 ).",

We found that school opening can be safe under strict NPIs (for example, restrictions on indoor dining, retail and gatherings), though a slight increase in infections among adults and C&Y within eight weeks following school reopening is to be expected (2.2% and 4.5% increase, respectively). Whether the reopening of schools can result in virus resurgence depends largely on countermeasures in the community. Our model predicts that the increase in case counts that occurred when schools opened were primarily due to the rise in contacts between adults returning to work and social activities after schools opened. Importantly, it was not due to an increase royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos R. Soc. Open Sci. 9: 211883 9 in contacts between C&Y. Sensitivity analyses further confirmed that adults represent the age group most affecting the spread of the infection, supporting our finding of rapid increases in case counts when the contact among adults is increased even slightly. Overall, reducing the contact rate in the community is more effective in mitigating the epidemic than school closures in terms of cases in adults, while household transmission plays a larger role for C&Y cases, especially in communities with a larger average household size. The safe operations of schools during the pandemic necessitates risk mitigation measures. We examined the effectiveness of those measures in a sensitivity analysis and found that in-person versus virtual attendance was the biggest driver of infection in school; with high in-person attendance, additional measures are needed to mitigate the outbreak. Strict public health measures (restricting gatherings, maintaining social distancing, etc.) to reduce contact rates, and self-protection behaviours (the use of masks and disinfectant, hand washing, etc.) to reduce the probability of transmission per contact, should be in place at the same time. Beyond stringent NPIs in the community, public health communication should also emphasize preventative practices, such as hand-washing, for students returning from school. Furthermore, widespread testing, tracing and isolation of mild cases have been shown to be effective in decreasing virus spread [3, 20, [25] [26] [27] 32] . Therefore, we conclude that overall, while the size and transmission in households dictates the allowable contacts to prevent community outbreaks, the key to allowing safe school opening is the maintenance of strict NPIs to reduce community spread.",

The school-related activities cannot be entirely blamed for the whole increased community transmission risk after school reopening. The rise of contact in adults returning to work and the increase of social and leisure time are also the major responsible drivers, verified by our model. Moreover, the rise in contacts in adults and C&Y is inescapable after schools reopened, which further illustrates the importance of the strict NPIs to allow safe reopening, although the slight increase of cases in C&Y. In the resurgence in Europe, it was also found that the smaller effect of closing schools and the stringent safety measures made schools safer compared with the first wave [49] .",

            "text": "The C&Y are facing a higher risk after school reopening in autumn 2021 under the circumstance of the higher transmissible Delta variant and relaxation of NPIs, and it is more challenging to maintain safe school operation during the pandemic. Although the vaccine coverage in the adult group is high, the transmission is worrying given the low efficacy of the vaccine against the Delta variant and the waning immunity [50, 51] . On the other hand, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States promotes vaccination for children 5 through 11 years old [52] , which may further reduce the transmission risk among C&Y in the schools. Nevertheless, with the limited reduction of transmission risk due to the vaccine [50, 53] , rigorous NPIs are still essential to allow safe reopening. Future modelling that incorporates variants of concern and vaccination rollout will allow for a deeper analysis of safe school opening during the transition of pandemic to endemic.",

First of all, the incorporation of household structure has significantly increased the complexity of our model, thereby limiting our ability to include households of larger household sizes. The composition of disease states in the household substantially increases in complexity with increasing household size. Our current model with household sizes 2 and 3 has more than 300 equations. Incorporating additional sizes will dramatically increase the number of equations and will result in technical difficulties in running the model. Our model description can allow other researchers to apply our methods to their own contexts, however. In addition, the intra-subpopulation risks were investigated by calculating its effective reproduction number based on the daily new infections of subpopulation and it may be overestimated because the mixed infection sources are not considered in the statistical model. However, it is a great indicator to inform the real-time spreading in each population along with the policy changes. Moreover, the indirect effects of school reopening, for example, more healthcare workers returning to work and thereby reducing mortality [54] [55] [56] , have not been explicitly modelled in our study. Future research is needed to explore this and other trickledown effects of school opening.",

However, with schools open, the increasing contacts among adults in the community can contribute to a large-scale surge in the epidemic in the absence of adequate NPIs that would prevent gatherings and contacts in indoor spaces. With both settings open, stringent preventative practices for students returning home from school and adults returning from work to reduce cross-transmission between the household, the community and the school are warranted.",

For example, scenario 2 uses the parameters of phase 2 (between 8 September and 2 October) and assumes that phase lasted the entire eight weeks. And phases differed in terms of both transmission levels and public health measures, including whether indoor and/or outdoor dining was permitted, the number of people allowed to gather, and retail capacity (for more detail, see electronic supplementary material, table A1). We compared the daily new cases of adults and C&Y population that our model predicts depending on whether schools were open or closed under different NPIs in the corresponding scenarios. We further considered the impact of increasing contacts in each of the adult and C&Y groups when school opens. Lastly, we investigated different thresholds for contact rates among adults for the safe opening of schools under different transmission probabilities and school reopening strategies.",
