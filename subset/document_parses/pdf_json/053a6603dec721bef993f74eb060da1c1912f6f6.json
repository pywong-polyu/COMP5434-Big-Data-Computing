To this are added two more specific objectives related to answer the following questions: (a) how to include the agents of the audiobook in the publishing circuit?, and (b) is this new business model consolidated within the Spanish publishing sector? Through the analysis of the publishing circuit and the production flow chart, it is possible to observe not only the impact of the audiobook on the entire operational process of a publisher but the new actors in the publishing business scene. Based on the existing data on the audiobook business in Spain, the study concludes that today, the Spanish publishing sector has recently begun to perceive the economic potential of this sound format. The confinement by COVID-19 has led to a collateral effect on the production, marketing, and consumption of audiobooks, driven by the two large publishing groups that dominate the book market in Spain.",

Nonetheless, the academic debate about the digital transition within the publishing sector did not contemplate the analysis of the audiobook business model [10] . The reason for this lack of interest is that this type of publishing emerged as an external process unrelated to the publishing sector only used, as a product derived from the conventional paper format, to attend promptly to specific market niches [5] . However, by the very nature of their product, audiobook publishers have always been at the forefront of technological change: with reel tapes, compact cassettes, and discs, up to the new formats that emerged in the context of the digital age [10] . Audiobooks already represent a $ 5 billion-a-year industry worldwide [2] .",

Yet today, the audiobook is open to a growing number of potential users, overcoming the traditional orientation of this format and guiding its use, not only in certain leisure moments where the audiobook can be complemented with another playful activity simultaneously given its adaptability to mobile devices but also in didactics and educational innovation is offering interesting results [1] .

As production nears the final stages, a team of editors confirms that spoken and written audio texts and printed books are a perfect match.
