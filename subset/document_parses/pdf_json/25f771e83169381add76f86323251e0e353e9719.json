High-throughput screening (HTS) offers the research field an opportunity to rapidly identify such compounds. In this work, we have developed a homogeneous cell-based HTS system using AlphaLISA detection technology for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP). Our assay measures both recombinant NP and endogenous NP from viral lysates and tissue culture supernatants (TCS) in a sandwich-based format using two monoclonal antibodies against the NP analyte. Viral NP was detected and quantified in both tissue culture supernatants and cell lysates, with large differences observed between 24 hours and 48 hours of infection. We simulated the viral infection by spiking in recombinant NP into 384-well plates with live Vero-E6 cells and were able to detect the NP with high sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Anti-viral agents that inhibit either viral cell entry or replication will decrease the AlphaLISA NP signal. Thus, this assay can be used for high-throughput screening of small molecules and biologics in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The unprecedented response from the global research community at every level of the life science enterprise has produced several therapeutic candidates such as the repurposed investigational Ebola drug remdesivir that targets the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2,3 , neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike (S) protein 4 , and convalescent plasma from recovered patients containing neutralizing antibodies 5 . Additionally, hundreds of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are currently under development with over two dozens of them in clinical phase I and II trials 6, 7 . While these are all viable options, no therapeutic option is yet approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, we must continue the search for other alternatives, a task that will benefit from new assays and reagents that facilitate rapid identification of small molecules and biologics that suppress viral infection to treat COVID-19.",

It also can be used for drug repurposing screens and evaluating therapeutic agents with high confidence, low variability, and generate information regarding an agent's potency via half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) and its maximum efficacy. Over the last decade, amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (AlphaLISA) technology has emerged as one of the most reliable screening technologies because of its versatility, sensitivity, and homogeneous format without the need for plate evacuation or washing 9 . AlphaLISA signal is generated when a donor bead is excited at an appropriate wavelength to general a reactive singlet oxygen radical that, when in close proximity to an acceptor bead, activates the acceptor bead to produce light at a specific wavelength 9 . It can be used to replace ELISA that requires multiple plate-wash steps for the quantitative detection of analytes. The conjugation of antibodies to biotin and streptavidin aids in the creation of a screening system that can be used as a competitive assay or sandwich assay format. In a competitive assay that uses one antibody, unlabeled analyte would compete with a labeled analyte donor or acceptor and decrease signal. In a sandwich assay, two antibodies raised against the same immunogen analyte, albeit at different epitopes, will both bind to the analyte and lead to an increase in signal.",

A successful reaction depends on the close proximity of the donor and acceptor. Multiple antibodies were matrixed together to determine which antibody pair produced the highest AlphaLISA signal (counts) from recombinant NP at 10,000 pg/mL (Fig. 1B,C) . The three best antibody pairs were 1+4, 11+4, and 11+10. Each pair was then tested against a titration of recombinant NP at 10,000 pg/mL, 1000 pg/mL, 100 pg/mL and 0 pg/mL, and produced a concentration dependent signal increase, with signal to background ratios (S/B, 10,000 pg/mL to 0 mg/mL) of 66.2, 72.8, and 51.5 based on the S/B, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Based on these results, pairs 1+4, and 11+4 were selected for further optimization. Interestingly, the pairs consisting of antibody 11 did not detect the Histidine (His)-tagged NP (Fig. 1B) , but generated the best signal with untagged NP (Fig. 1C) , suggesting the His-tag interferes with binding of antibody 11 to NP. The other antibody pairs produced relatively similar counts regardless of the NP protein used in the optimization.",

The hook effect indicates the concentration of analyte at which an overabundance of analyte titrates the donor and acceptor away from each other, and this hooking dictates the upper limit of detection before the signal will start to decrease. Two different lysis buffers were used to optimize any lysis buffer effects; the NCATS lysis buffer consisted of 0.5% Triton-X 100 with protease inhibitor, the other was the AlphaLISA lysis buffer from the manufacturer. For pair 1+4, both lysis buffers performed equally, while the AlphaLISA lysis buffer performed better for pair 11+4 in generating the standard curve. The overall S/B was higher for pair 11+4 at higher concentrations of NP, but pair 1+4 had a higher sensitivity as seen by the larger S/B values at lower concentrations (Fig. 2B,F) .",

NP detection in the presence of lysed 10,000 and 5,000 cell per well performed similarly to NP detection in media, and better than in 20,000 cells per well. 20,000 cells per well would be considered over-confluent beyond 100%.

The main difference between the LBs was that a signal plateau was observed for the NCATS LB indicating an upper limit of detection of approximately 1500 ng/mL, whereas the AlphaLISA buffer could potentially detect higher concentrations. Importantly, the sensitivity of the assay with NCATS LB reveals a similar lower limit of detection of 0.23 ng/mL as in previous experiments, whereas the AlphaLISA buffer was observed be less sensitive with a lower limit of detection of 2.06 ng/mL for 10,000 cells per well, for example. 0, al s.

In this work we have designed and developed through meticulous optimization an AlphaLISA sandwich-based detection system to identify the SARS-CoV-2 NP. Here, two antibodies were identified to detect recombinant and virally-generated NP both in solution and in cell culture. Importantly, we demonstrated a significant increase in NP with longer incubation of virally-infected Vero-E6 cells and were able to quantitatively assess the NP concentration using standard curve interpolation. This assay system should be able to identify compounds that decrease the presence of SARS-CoV-2 NP as a measure of anti-viral activity that either prevents viral entry or viral replication leading to the translation of NP in cells. Our add-and-read system requires no wash steps or removal of cell culture media, providing an excellent methodology for the use in biosafety level 3/4 (BSL 3/4) facilities that require simple and easy to use assay technologies for drug screening and validation.",

Protease inhibitor was added to the lysis buffer before lysing cells. Cells were scraped to the bottom of the well and pooled lysates were collected into 1.5 mL tubes on ice. Tubes were vortexed for 10 s and placed on ice for 10 min. This was repeated three times. Lysates were spun down for 30 min at 13.2k rpm at 4\u00b0C and stored at -20\u00b0C until further use.",
