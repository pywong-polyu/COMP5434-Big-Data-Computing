            "text": "Background: The introduction of adjuvant systemic treatment has significantly improved recurrence-free survival in patients with resectable high-risk melanoma. Adjuvant treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapy, however, substantially impacts health care budgets, while the number of patients with melanoma who are treated in the adjuvant setting is still increasing. To evaluate the socioeconomic impact of the three adjuvant treatments, a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was carried out. Materials and methods: Data were obtained from the three pivotal registration phase III clinical trials on the adjuvant treatment of patients with resected high-risk stage III in melanoma (KEYNOTE-054, CheckMate 238, and COMBI-AD). For this CEA, a Markov model with three health states (no evidence of disease, recurrent/progressive disease, and death) was applied. From a societal perspective, different adjuvant strategies were compared according to total costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. To evaluate model uncertainty, sensitivity analyses (deterministic and probabilistic) were carried out. Results: In the adjuvant setting, total costs (per patient) were V168 826 for nivolumab, V194 529 for pembrolizumab, and V211 110 for dabrafenib-trametinib. These costs were mainly determined by drug acquisition costs, whereas routine surveillance costs varied from V126 096 to V134 945. Compared with routine surveillance, LYs improved by approximately 1.41 for all therapies and QALYs improved by 2.02 for immune checkpoint inhibitors and 2.03 for targeted therapy. This resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of V21 153 (nivolumab), V33 878 (pembrolizumab), and V37 520 (dabrafenib-trametinib) per QALY gained. Conclusions: This CEA compared the three EMA-approved adjuvant systemic therapies for resected stage III melanoma. Adjuvant treatment with nivolumab was the most cost-effective, followed by pembrolizumab. Combination therapy with dabrafenib-trametinib was the least cost-effective. With the increasing number of patients with high-risk melanoma who will be treated with adjuvant treatment, there is an urgent need to reduce drug costs while developing better prognostic and predictive tools to identify patients who will benefit from adjuvant treatment.",

            "text": "Cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive skin cancer and its incidence is increasing worldwide. 1, 2 Life expectancy of patients with melanoma is determined by disease stage, with 10-year overall survival (OS) rates ranging from 98% for stage I to 32% for stage IV melanoma. 3, 4 The survival rates of patients with irresectable stage III and metastatic stage IV melanoma have significantly improved since the introduction of systemic therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and targeted therapy (TT). [5] [6] [7] [8] To enhance antitumor Tcell-mediated immune responses, ICIs block programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) (ipilimumab). Based on their similar mechanism of action and efficacy, nivolumab and pembrolizumab are considered interchangeable. [9] [10] [11] [12] TTs have a different mechanism of action, 13 as the selective BRAF inhibitors (e.g. dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitors (e.g. trametinib) block cancer cell proliferation in melanomas driven by a mutated BRAF gene (BRAFmt), which is present in 40%-60% of melanomas. 14, 15 More recently, adjuvant systemic therapy has been shown to improve the recurrence-free survival (RFS) [16] [17] [18] and distant metastasis-free survival 19 in patients with completely resected stage III cutaneous melanoma. In three randomized, controlled trials, 1-year adjuvant treatment with ICIs (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) or TT (combination dabrafenib-trametinib) was compared with placebo after complete resection in patients with stage IIIA-C melanoma. In patients with stage N1a melanoma, tumor load in the sentinel node had to be >1 mm in greatest diameter, according to the Rotterdam criteria. [20] [21] [22] As compared with routine surveillance, adjuvant systemic therapy improved 3year RFS from 39% to 58% (placebo versus dabrafenibtrametinib), 45%-58% (ipilimumab versus nivolumab), and 44%-64% (placebo versus pembrolizumab). [23] [24] [25] Although the OS data of the pivotal trials were still awaited, 16, 18, 26 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have already granted extension to adjuvant treatment with dabrafenib-trametinib, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab (FDA only). In clinical practice, adjuvant treatment is usually selected based on melanoma characteristics and the inclusion criteria of these phase III trials. Most patients with completely resected stage III BRAF-mt cutaneous melanoma are candidates for any of the three different adjuvant treatments, whereas patients with completely resected stage III BRAF wild-type melanoma are only candidates for adjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab or nivolumab. The preferred adjuvant systemic treatment strategy has, however, not yet been defined.",

Routine surveillance is usually applied to patients who do not have adjuvant treatment because of co-morbidities or patients' wishes. In addition, EMA has not granted approval for ipilimumab in the adjuvant setting because of severe adverse events (AEs). 26 Therefore, placebo (as a proxy for routine surveillance) was used as comparator for the three adjuvant treatment strategies with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and dabrafenib-trametinib.",

For probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA), variations in multiple parameters at the same time were taken into account, by performing 1000 Monte-Carlo simulations. 31 Samples were randomly drawn To better understand the clinical application of these calculations, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were generated, using a V50 000 willingness to pay (WTP) threshold. WTP is a preference-based construct that reflects burden of disease (describing loss of health and death due to disease 41 ) by assessing the monetary value of a hypothetical cure for a disease. 42 After surgical complete resection, patients have NED when adjuvant treatment is started and the burden of disease is considered intermediate. 43 In contrast to advanced/metastatic melanoma, that carries a high burden of disease and is accompanied with a WTP of V80 000 per QALY gained, WTP for patients with resected stage III melanoma has been set at V50 000 per QALY gained (in the Netherlands). 43",

Combination therapy with dabrafenib-trametinib was the least costeffective (V37 520/QALY). This difference can largely be attributed to the high drug acquisition costs for adjuvant treatment, ranging from V64 094 (nivolumab) to V89 920 (pembrolizumab), to V108 295 (dabrafenib-trametinib) per patient. Compared with QALYs in patients with routine surveillance (5.41-5.43), QALYs improved for patients with adjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab or nivolumab (7.43) and dabrafenib-trametinib (7.46), while gaining 1.41 LYs (all systemic therapies). Changing the time horizon from lifetime to 15 years yielded the greatest effect on the model results, which indicates that most costs are accumulated at the beginning of the treatment. These curves summarize information on uncertainty in cost-effectiveness estimates for nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and dabrafenib-trametinib.

Although KEYNOTE-054 did not include patients with in-transit metastases, the distribution of melanoma stages was comparable with the COMBI-AD trial (16% versus 19% stage IIIA; 46% versus 39% stage IIIB; 38% versus 41% stage IIIC for pembrolizumab and dabrafenib-trametinib, respectively), as well as median age (54 versus 50 years).",

            "text": "In this CEA, adjuvant treatment strategies of stage III melanoma were compared according to all relevant utilities and costs, including health care and societal costs. Our model shows that cost-effectiveness mainly depends on drug acquisition costs, which is in line with other Markov models comparing systemic adjuvant therapies (including ipilimumab) from a US ($) perspective. 47, 48 Although discrepancies between formal and actual list prices are not uncommon, drug prices seemed to be quite similar in The Netherlands. 49 The actual prices are not freely accessible, however, and are different across countries. In contrast to the phase III trials in which weight-based dosing was used, we assumed a flat-fixed dosing regimen for all patients, as this is widely applied in current clinical practice and no patient-level data were available. Furthermore, the optimal drug dosing (weight-based versus fixed-flat dosing) is open for debate. [50] [51] [52] Other health care costs were related to hospital visits (including drug administration and admissions), diagnostics, local treatment (radiotherapy/ surgery), or BSC. Since dabrafenib-trametinib is not administered intravenously at the outpatient clinic, but can be taken orally at home, drug administration costs were negligible. The model incorporated the scanning and treatment intervals of the adjuvant trials (2-weekly for nivolumab, 3-weekly for pembrolizumab, and 4-weekly for dabrafenib-trametinib). In current clinical practice, longer time intervals between treatments (i.e. 4-weekly for nivolumab and 6-weekly for pembrolizumab) are increasingly common, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic, where hospital visits are limited as much as possible. While the frequency of hospital visits will have limited impact on actual costs, extending these intervals could reduce the burden on both patients and health care resources, and could be a first step to reduce costs. Furthermore, the adjuvant treatment duration is currently set at 1 year. To reduce treatment-related toxicity while limiting drug spillage and costs, the optimal adjuvant treatment strategy should be determined. The optimal duration of treatment in patients with advanced melanoma is already being investigated in a prospective trial. 53 The model input had several limitations worth mentioning. First, since adjuvant treatment of melanoma has been introduced in clinic recently, long-term real-world data on efficacy (i.e. RFS and OS) and QALYs are not available yet. In addition, the clinical trial data did not provide detailed information on type of recurrence and subsequent treatment. Therefore, assumptions had to be based on the current available (trial) data which may not reflect the realworld outcomes. 54 Second, according to traditional methods to perform a CEA of anticancer drugs using a Markov model, patients' health states can be stable or worsen, but never improve (i.e. from RPD to NED). In real life, patients' health states can improve, since patients can transit to NED. As the QALYs capture decrease in QoL after disease progression, this might have resulted in an underestimation of QALYs. This limitation, however, was applicable for all three adjuvant treatment strategies. Third, according to CEA guidelines, AEs were not included as no grade 3-4 AEs exceeded the threshold of 5% incidence. [16] [17] [18] Whereas the impact of AEs on ICERs is considered to be limited, patients suffer from these AEs, which can be lifelong and sometimes require lifelong therapy such as hormone replacement. 55 In addition, AEs in patients treated with TT (dabrafenib-trametinib) are more often reversible, 56 which could result in lower costs for supportive care.",

Drug acquisition costs placed a significant burden on the health care budget (per patient): V64 094 for nivolumab, V89 920 for pembrolizumab, and V108 295 for dabrafenib-trametinib.Societal costs ranged from V11 567 to V33 804, of which approximately V12 000 could be attributed to lost productivity costs for patients who were treated with systemic therapy in the adjuvant setting and V25 000 for the routine surveillance group. Over a lifetime, patients gained 1.41 LYs and 2.02 QALYs when treated with ICIs (nivolumab/ pembrolizumab) compared with routine surveillance. For patients treated with dabrafenib-trametinib, the gained LYs and QALYs were 1.41 and 2.03, respectively. In terms of incremental costs and benefits, ICERs were V21 153/QALY and V30 305/LY for nivolumab, V33 878/QALY and V48 534/LY for pembrolizumab, and V37 520/QALY and V54 018/LY for dabrafenib-trametinib, when compared with routine surveillance.",
