Misinformation originating from various sources has been spreading online since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we present a dataset of Twitter posts that exhibit a strong anti-vaccine stance. The dataset consists of two parts: a) a streaming keyword-centered data collection with more than 1.8 million tweets, and b) a historical account-level collection with more than 135 million tweets. The former leverages the Twitter streaming API to follow a set of specific vaccine-related keywords starting from mid-October 2020. The latter consists of all historical tweets of 70K accounts that were engaged in the active spreading of anti-vaccine narratives. We present descriptive analyses showing the volume of activity over time, geographical distributions, topics, news sources, and inferred account political leaning. This dataset can be used in studying anti-vaccine misinformation on social media and enable a better understanding of vaccine hesitancy. In compliance with Twitter's Terms of Service, our anonymized dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/gmuric/avax-tweets-dataset",

            "text": "The opposition to vaccination dates back to the 1800s, right after the English physician Edward Jenner created the first vaccine in human history. The opponents were loud and could be found in all segments of society: religious communities protested the unnaturalness of using animal infection in humans, parents were concerned about the invasive procedure, and vaccinated people were often illustrated with a cow's heads growing from their neck 1 . Even though vaccination is an effective way to prevent diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles, almost 1 in 5 children still do not receive routine life-saving immunizations, and an estimated 1.5 million children still die each year of diseases that could be prevented by vaccines that already exist 2 . These fatalities are not only caused by objective reasons such as lack of access to vaccines due to poverty, etc., but also by the unwillingness and fear against vaccines from children's parents. The term \"vaccine hesitancy\" refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccine services 3 . A variety of factors contributes to vaccine hesitancy, including safety concerns, religious reasons, personal beliefs, philosophical reasons, and desire for additional education 4 . During the COVID-19 pandemic, while the inoculation of large populations is increasingly important, anti-vaccine narratives are spreading like wildfire endangering public health, human lives, and social order.",

            "text": "With the rise of social media, the dissemination of information (hence, potentially, misinformation) has become easier than ever before. Unsurprisingly, anti-vaccine activists have also began to utilize platforms like Twitter to share their views. As a result, their activism has expanded jurisdictions to include online propaganda. Compared with traditional communication channels, social media offer an unprecedented opportunity to spread anti-vaccination messages and allow communities to form around anti-vaccine sentiment 5 . Social media can amplify the effects of anti-vaccination misinformation: links between susceptibility to misinformation and both vaccine hesitancy and a reduced likelihood to comply with health guidance measures have been shown by multiple studies [5] [6] [7] [8] . Based on these findings, vaccine-related misinformation on social media may exacerbate the levels of vaccine hesitancy, creating pockets with low vaccination rates in the United States and globally; this can hamper progress toward vaccine-induced herd immunity, and potentially increase infections related to new COVID-19 variants, possibly leading to vaccine-resistant mutations. For these reasons, understanding vaccine hesitancy through the lens of social media is of paramount importance. Since data access is the first obstacle to attain that, to enable the research community, we built and made public a social media dataset of anti-vaccine content, vaccine misinformation and related conspiracies.",

Using the Twitter Streaming API and the set of seed keywords, we collected the data for one day (October 18, 2020), after which we extracted other keywords that co-occur with the seed keywords. We added the newly collected keywords to the list of the seed keywords, checking them manually for relevance and excluding irrelevant ones. We then repeated this step several times until we reached about 60 keywords and exhausted the significant co-occurrences. The Twitter API can be queried with a sub-string of a longer keyword and it will return the tweets that contain the sub-string. For example, the keyword \"novaccine\" will return the tweets that contain \"novaccineforme\". We attempted to keep only the most informative and relevant stem words, to capture most vaccine-related tweets and to avoid collecting less relevant ones. The list of all keywords used to collect the streaming collection is listed in Table 1 . Collecting tweets for account collection First, we identified a randomly-sampled set of \u2248 70K accounts that appeared in the streaming collection and were engaged in anti-vaccine rhetoric toward the end of 2020, either by tweeting some of the tracked keywords or by retweeting tweets that contain some of the tracked keywords. Then, for those accounts, we collected their historical tweets, using the Twitter Search API. By leveraging the Twitter's Academic Research Product Track, we were able to access the full archival search and overcome the limit of 3,600 historical tweets of the standard API. 2",

For each account in the dataset, we keep a record of all retweets and the original tweets that contain a domain from the set of selected media outlets.

The vast majority of tweets come from countries with predominantly English speaking population. Approximately 68% of all tweets originated in the United states, 12.5% in Great Britain, 5.5% in Canada, 1.2% in Ireland, 1.1% in Australia and the rest of the tweets come from other countries. In Figure 2 , we show the distribution of the tweets' geolocations in the United States. As expected, states with a large population, such as California, Texas, Florida and New York have more tweets in absolute terms (Figure 2a ). The number of tweets normalized by state population is provided in Figure 2b , where Hawaii, Alaska, and Maine rank 1st, 2nd, 3rd places, respectively. Table 3 lists the top 15 tweeted hashtags in the streaming collection. The count is the total number of times a hashtag appears, and the frequency quantifies the proportion of tweets that contain a specific hashtag out of all tweets with a hashtag. Note that there are many tweets without any hashtag and many tweets with a hashtag contain more than one hashtag. Besides the most common general hashtags that are expected to be found, such as \"#vaccine\" and \"#covid19\", we observe a high proportion of hashtags that carry strong anti-vaccine sentiment such as \"#novaccineforme\", \"#vaxxed\" and \"#vaccineinjury\". For example, the hashtag \"#novaccineforme\" can be found in more than 25K tweets, accounting for 6.6% of all tweets in the streaming collection that contain a hashtag. A large set of common hashtags is related to some of the debunked conspiracy theories, claiming that there is a global plot by rich individuals to reduce world population, often expressed through hashtags such as \"#depopulation\", \"#billgatesbioterrorist\" and \"#arrestbillgates\". Another set of very frequent hashtags looks benign on the surface: Hashtags such as \"#learntherisk\" and \"#informedconsent\" appear to communicate genuine concerns about the safety of the vaccines; however, those hashtags are usually a decoy and are very often used by the same accounts who are strongly opposing vaccination and who otherwise often use more explicit anti-vaccine hashtags.

NCBI houses PubMed, the largest bibliographic database for biomedical literature. This can give a false impression that the tweets from the streaming collection share information from legitimate scientific sources. However, most of the papers from PubMed are cited with false and misleading conclusions. Sometimes, anti-vaccine advocates would share legitimate scientific papers documenting rare side-effects of the vaccines, while over-emphasizing the observed adverse effects and calling for vaccine boycotts. Sharing a scientific study in a tweet provides an illusion of credibility. Cherry-picking desirable sentences and relying on the fact that the majority of the audience will not make an effort to read a scientific paper in details, makes it a very effective strategy for manipulation.

The current account collection consists of more than 135 million tweets published by over 78K unique accounts, and spans the period from March 3, 2007 to February 8, 2021. In Figure 5 , we illustrate some of the most important statistics from this data collection. Figure 5a shows a distribution of tweets per account. Approximately half of the accounts published fewer than 1,500 tweets, 40% of the accounts have more than 2,000 tweets and 1.5% have more than 5,000 tweets.

For \u2248 70% of the accounts, the oldest collected tweet dates from 2020. There is a significant portion of accounts whose historical tweets date much earlier with \u2248 18% of accounts with their earliest tweet dating before 2018 and \u2248 6.8% accounts with the tweets before 2014. Such relatively long-spanning collection of historical tweets at the account level may allow for a comprehensive temporal analysis of how vaccine hesitancy developed on Twitter over the years.",

Hence, we can see many politically-motivated narratives in the data originating during that time period. Accounts that share common misinformation related to the vaccines are prone to conspiratorial thinking and very often shares other conspiracy narratives, usually the politically charged ones.

For example, a video titled \"Dr.SHIVA LIVE: Truth Freedom & Health. Vs. Fear Fauci & Fascism.\", published by a self-proclaimed \"doctor\" (the account has been since suspended by Twitter), had more than 62K viewers.
