            "text": "The burden of chronic disease in Europe continues to grow. A major challenge facing national governments is how to tackle the risk factors of sedentary lifestyle, alcohol abuse, smoking, and unhealthy diet. These factors are complex and necessitate intersectoral collaboration to strengthen health promotion, counter-act the social determinants of health, and reduce the prevalence of chronic disease. European countries have diverse intersectoral collaboration to encourage health promotion activities. In the Joint Action CHRODIS-PLUS success factors for intersectoral collaboration within and outside healthcare which strengthen health promotion activities were identified with a mixed method design via a survey of 22 project partners in 14 countries and 2 workshops. In six semi-structured interviews, the mechanisms underlying these success factors were examined. These mechanisms can be very context-specific but do give more insight into how they can be replicated. In this paper, 20 health promotion interventions from national programs in CHRODIS PLUS are explored. This includes community interventions, policy actions, integrated approaches, capacity building, and training activities. The interventions involved collaboration across three to more than six sectors. The conclusion is a set of seven recommendations that are considered to be essential for fostering intersectoral collaboration to improve health-promoting activities.",

Given the interdependent nature of the determinants, intersectoral collaboration is necessary. The health sector cannot solve such a complex problem alone [6, 9, [16] [17] [18] .

The ageing of the working population combined with the dramatic low employment rates of persons with chronic diseases (PwCDs) is an indicative depiction of this particular relation [21, 22] .

The terms are often being used interchangeably. In his review, Dubois et al. searched for a consensual definition for the intersectoral work but could not find such a definition [25] . As a result, the authors constructed their own definition based on the structure: What: what is the action (process, collaboration, coordination)? Who: who are the actors conducting the collaboration?, and Why: what are the goals or objectives of the action? Their definition of intersectoral action for health is: the recognized relationship between a part or parts of the health sector with a part or parts of another sector that has been formed to take action on an issue to achieve health outcomes and intermediate health outcomes in a more effective, efficient, or sustainable way than could be achieved by the health sector acting alone [25] .

Collaboration with many parties is important for success in health promotion and reduction of health inequalities but is also challenging. It is important to build on what is already known about the important elements for intersectoral collaboration. Danahar et al. [30] identified successful elements for intersectoral collaboration aiming to reduce health inequalities such as shared vision, strong relationship among partners (effective mix), and leadership (advancing purposes, resources, and sustainability of collaboration and efficient structures and processes to do the work). Similar elements are cited when examining collaboration in primary healthcare: enhancing staff satisfaction, defining and selling program goals, increasing professional capacity, establishing flexible legal and structural framework, building trust, promoting collaboration as competency, developing nationals goals through organic participatory processes, aligning structural incentives according to program goals, creating organizational synapses through information technology, and developing innovative monitoring and evaluation schemes [32] . Storm et al. [33] identified five steps as a base for Health in All Policies (HiAP): involvement of the appropriate policy sector in public health, harmonization of objectives, coordinated use of policies and actions by relevant policy sectors, formalized collaboration and experience amongst relevant policy sectors, and favorable contextual factors [33] . Many factors are contextual [32] , but some general facilitating elements for intersectoral collaboration can be derived: shared vision of problems to be addressed, strong relationship among partners, mutual and joint benefits/win-win, resources and funding, communication, involvement of community and target group, leadership, capacity building/training, time to build a relationship, and macro-level context (e.g., changes on system level).",

Three were practices shown in Table 1 (Healthy Overvecht, Vesote Lifestyle Counselling, Health Promotion for people at risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes) and two practices were not included in Table 1 : Integrated care for people with chronic wounds (implementation of a model to integrate care within and outside healthcare for people with chronic wounds. The program entails preventive visits by nurses, new programs, e.g., physical activity for elderly people and for people with type 2 diabetes, in the health promotion centers, and collaboration with social care institutes (Slovenia) from another CHRODIS PLUS work package to increase interaction among members of the partnership) and the Prevention of Childhood Obesity (additional plan with a mix of interventions to prevent overweight and obesity of children (Hungary), key note presentation on a national program presented by the expert on intersectoral collaboration on the national level in Hungary). The additional practices were used to contrast initial findings. At the workshop, an experienced facilitator familiar with the results of the Phase 1 online survey led a discussion about the role of intersectoral collaboration in the interventions. Success factors enabling effective intersectoral collaboration were identified during the small group discussions focusing on the five above-mentioned examples.

They were asked whether they thought the draft recommendations (including the Why and How) were feasible or needed adaptations. Additionally, prior to the workshop, two experts, one in integrated healthcare and one in intersectoral collaboration outside the healthcare sector, were asked to reflect on the draft recommendations. The feedback from partners and experts were summarized and adaptations were made to the recommendations accordingly, which resulted in the addition of a seventh recommendation.

The health-promotion interventions aimed to improve the unhealthy lifestyle factors such as unhealthy diet, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol misuse, and stress prevention. Improving health literacy and reduction of health inequalities were also targeted. Most of the interventions (N = 16) were national programs and long-lasting, with a typical duration of more than five years. These programs consisted of a mix of discrete health-promotion strategies or practices such as community interventions, policy actions, integrated approaches, and capacity building and/or training.

Half of the interventions worked together with three or more disciplines within healthcare. Eight collaborated with more than six sectors outside the healthcare sector and seven engaged in intersectoral collaboration with three to five sectors outside the healthcare sector.

Many interventions sought to reach vulnerable or minority groups, such as people with low socio-economic status, immigrants, individuals with low health literacy, and those with high health risks (e.g., history of mental disorders and/or substance abuse, sleep problems, physically inactive or overweight, medical risk factors for specific diseases). To reach the target populations, interventions often targeted different groups of professionals, such as employers, educators, health and social professionals, and policy makers.",

            "text": "The degree of intersectoral collaboration was often related to the scope of the intervention (several lifestyle topics), and the target population to be reached by the health-promotion intervention in this sample, meeting good practice criteria. When the program aimed to reach a large range of the population and targeted to improve lifestyle, high intersectoral collaboration (e.g., more than six sectors and/or three disciplines) tended to be present. To reach the whole population and to have an impact on the health behavior and outcomes, it is necessary to involve different intermediate groups and policymakers/departments and organize a mix of interventions in different settings. That requires intersectoral collaboration. The Andalusion Strategy of Local Action in Health, for instance, was highly intersectoral because they targeted the whole population and the intermediate groups such as private companies (youth) healthcare, schools, sports, employers, municipal health services, and welfare. In contrast, interventions carried out in a specific setting collaborated with fewer sectors, although high multidisciplinarity was achieved. For example, Iceland's Program of Coordinated Action and Strategy of Health Promotion in School Healthcare worked with two sectors and three disciplines. In general, programs aiming to reduce health inequalities tended to collaborate with six sectors or more. However, it is important to recognize that only good practices were examined. It is possible that health-promotion and disease-prevention programs that aim to target a large range of the population and do not effectively achieve intersectoral collaboration may not have led to good outcomes/results, and therefore, they would not have been included in the sample of good practices studied. Further research on the relationship between reach of a program and degree of intersectoral collaboration is warranted.",

Fifteen of the twenty interventions used a framework and these frameworks varied widely and served different functions. Some used legal frameworks (e.g., European, national, or local laws), whereas others used a national plan as a logic model [35] with programs, project, and activities or the strategy of the practice (e.g., strategy for social inclusion of Roma's). Other respondents highlighted the usefulness of frameworks they developed to organize the collaboration and foster communication, such as a national platform set up by the Ministry of Health and several other ministries, a membership organization, or specific networking methods. Finally, respondents valued frameworks that described how to carry out the work involved, such as the four-domain model (body, mind, social, and relations/network) to provide care in a uniform way (Healthy Overvecht, the Netherlands) and reference manuals, such as \"How to become a healthy workplace\" (Lombardy Workplace Network, Italy).",

The INHERIT project addressed the reduction of health inequalities as one of its main targets, hence the recommendation about ensuring that initiatives are inclusive. Although many of the interventions evaluated in Task 5.3 addressed health inequalities, and inclusiveness is part of Recommendation 3, creating an effective mix of partners', this aspect was not highlighted specifically in the final recommendations. This omission was due to the fact that the focus of the present study was on strengthening health-promotion activities to prevent chronic diseases and not specifically on reducing health inequalities. Future efforts to facilitate intersectoral collaboration should evaluate the role of inclusiveness and, if determined valuable, recommendations for how to achieve it.",

Very few interventions addressed intersectoral collaboration within the healthcare sector, as there is more and more debate in the European countries about the necessity for a change from focus on care towards more prevention and health promotion because of the contribution to decreasing the costs. This can be explained by the fact that since the Ottawa Charter, the collaboration with sectors outside the healthcare sector is seen as one of the most promising actions to strengthen health promotion. Further study of intersectoral collaboration within healthcare is warranted, as the seven recommendations may need more elaboration for this specific sub-type of intersectoral collaboration which was under-represented in the sampling of the interventions.",

A framework permits a common understanding of an approach and provides a structure to evaluate how different factors (e.g., conditions for success) connect with each other. Although several frameworks exist, no one framework emerges from the literature as a gold standard [25] . In addition, frameworks are used for different functions. Some are used for research aims (Bergen model [40] ), to list conditions for success [41] , to identify potential key mechanisms [42] , or to develop a comprehensive list of coordinated action [43] .

In this regard, capitalization on existing networks will likely become increasingly important over time. Improving and strengthening existing health and decreasing health inequalities is complex, and permanent collaboration structures are needed to permit timely response to these challenges. While the focus of health promotion programs may be different (e.g., overweight, fall prevention, physical activity), the approaches that must be taken should, in general, be similar. Successful implementation of these programs requires an established prevention infrastructure, independent of the topic, which is spearheaded by the local or regional government. In addition, they should cooperate with other public organizations as well as with private enterprises and non-profit organizations. Future research is needed to identify good practices regarding the creation and maintenance of these kinds of permanent structures or networks.",

The data collected did not allow for a determination of the necessary and/or sufficient criteria for successful intersectoral collaboration. It is not known if all of the recommendations must be implemented or if certain ones are more essential than others. In a recently published article from CHRODIS-PLUS on health-promotion interventions, context is considered to be one of the key factors for successful implementation [45] , but it is challenging to study. To adequately and appropriately address contextual factors, a realist evaluation method can be used [46] [47] [48] . Steenkamer and colleagues wrote a review on integrated care, healthcare, social care, and wider public services [49] , in which they present eight guiding principles with insight into strategies (the HOW), the necessary context (the example, see Table S2 for the elaborated version of the recommendations), and the extracted theory that underlie the recommendation (the WHY). Only one specific context (the example) per recommendation is described in this study. Had the realist evaluation method been used, much more information on inhibiting and enabling contexts would have been gathered, which would have provided more supporting evidence for underlying mechanisms of action which are crucial for the successful implementation of the recommendations.
