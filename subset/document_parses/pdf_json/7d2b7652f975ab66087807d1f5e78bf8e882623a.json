A potential mechanism to protect this population is passive immunization via the milk of a previously infected person. We and others have reported on the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human milk. We now report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in the milk of 74 COVID-19-recovered participants, and find that 89% of samples are positive for Spike-specific IgA. In a subset of these samples, 95% exhibited robust IgA activity as determined by endpoint binding titer, with 50% considered high-titer. These IgA-positive samples were also positive for Spike-specific secretory antibody. Levels of IgA antibodies and secretory antibodies were shown to be strongly positively correlated. The secretory IgA response was dominant among the milk samples tested compared to the IgG response, which was present in 75% of samples and found to be of high-titer in only 13% of cases. Our IgA durability analysis using 28 paired samples, obtained 4-6 weeks and 4-10 months after infection, found that all samples exhibited persistently significant Spikespecific IgA, with 43% of donors exhibiting increasing IgA titers over time. Finally, COVID-19 and pre-pandemic control milk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies; 6 of 8 COVID-19 samples exhibited neutralization of Spike-pseudotyped VSV (IC 50 range, 2.39-89.4ug/mL) compared to 1 of 8 controls. IgA binding and neutralization capacities were found to be strongly positively correlated. These data are highly relevant to public health, not only in terms of the protective capacity of these antibodies for breastfed infants, but also for the potential use of such antibodies as a COVID-19 therapeutic, given that secretory IgA is highly in all mucosal compartments.

Furthermore, infants and young children can also transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others and the efficacy of vaccines available for adults have not yet been evaluated for young children or infants [3] .

Mature human milk contains~0.6mg/mL of total immunoglobulin [5] . Approximately 90% of human milk antibody (Ab) is IgA, nearly all in secretory (s) form (sIgA, which consists of polymeric Abs complexed to J-chain and secretory component (SC) proteins) [6] . Nearly all sIgA derives from the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), via the entero-mammary link, though there is also homing of B cells from other mucosa (e.g., from the respiratory system), and possibly drainage from local lymphatics of systemic IgA to the mammary gland [6] . Unlike the Abs found in serum, sIgA in milk is highly stable and resistant to enzymatic degradation not only in milk and the infant mouth and gut, but in all mucosae including the gastrointestinal tract, upper airway, and lungs [7] . Notably, it has been shown that after 2 hours in the infant stomach, the total IgA concentration decreases by <50%, while IgG concentration decreases by >75% [8] .",

In that preliminary study, it was found that all samples exhibited significant IgA binding activity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike. Eighty percent of samples further tested for Ab binding reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike exhibited significant IgA binding, and all of these samples were also positive for RBD-specific secretory Ab reactivity with only small subsets of samples exhibiting specific IgG and/or IgM activity, strongly suggesting the RBD-specific IgA was sIgA. In the present study, we report on the prevalence and isotypes of Spike-specific milk Ab from a larger cohort of donors obtained 4-6 weeks post-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the durability of these Abs up to 10 months post-infection, and on SARS-CoV-2-directed neutralization by Abs in a subset of these samples.",

Individuals were eligible to have their milk samples included in this analysis if they were lactating and had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (by an FDA-approved COVID-19 PCR test) 4-6 weeks prior to the initial milk sample used for analysis. This post-infection window was selected so as to minimize any contact with participants or their samples when they might have been contagious to the research team, while still capturing the reported peak period for SARS-CoV-2 Ab responses [10] . Participants were excluded if they had any acute or chronic health conditions affecting the immune system. Participants were recruited nationally via social media in April-June of 2020 and subject to an informed consent process. Certain participants contributed milk they had previously frozen for personal reasons, while most pumped samples specifically for this research project. All participants were either asymptomatic or experienced mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 that were managed at home. Participants were asked to collect approximately 30mL of milk per sample into a clean container using electronic or manual pumps, and if able and willing, to continue to pump and save monthly milk samples after the initial sample as part of our longitudinal analysis. If any of the participants submitted longitudinal samples at least 4 months after their initial sample, those samples were also included in the present analysis. As little longitudinal mucosal Ab data in COVID-19-recovered individuals past 3 months has been reported to date, the \ufffd4 month time point was selected, and as many samples that were available were used. To estimate the proportion (p) of all COVID-19-recovered milk donors that would exhibit positive IgA titers against SARS-CoV-2 in their milk after infection, we determined based on the reported IgG seroconversion rate of 90% after mild SARS-CoV-2 infection [11] , that the precision (d) of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for p (CI = [p+-d]), as a function of the cohort size N of 74 would allow us to estimate p with 6.79% error. In terms of the cohort size N of 20 for milk IgG and secretory Ab analyses, this would allow us to estimate p with 13.15% error.",

All demographic information on participant milk samples is shown in Table 1 . Given the diversity of participant ages and stages of lactation, this study sample can be considered representative of a larger population. Notably, 67% of COVID-19-recovered participants reported their race/ethnicity as white or Caucasian, and therefore this sample set is not diverse enough to be considered representative of the USA as a whole. More work needs to be done to obtain sufficient samples from non-white participants.

Centrifugation was repeated 2x to ensure removal of all cells and fat. Skimmed acellular milk was aliquoted and frozen at -80\u02daC until testing. Both COVID-19 recovered and control milk samples were then tested in separate assays measuring IgA, IgG, and secretory-type Abs, in which the secondary Ab used for the latter measurement was specific for free and bound SC.

This cell line was routinely verified for consistent ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression by flow cytometry as well as by inclusion of assay-to-assay control virus to monitor consistent infection levels. Pseudovirus was produced by transfection of 293T cells with SARS-CoV-2 Spike plasmid, followed 8 h later by infection with a VSV\u0394G-rLuc reporter virus. Two days post-infection, supernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation [13] . Cells and viruses were prepared by and obtained from the Benhur Lee lab. A consistent,pretitrated amount of pseudovirus was incubated with serial dilutions of extracted IgA for 30 min at room temperature prior to infection of cells seeded the previous day.

Endpoint dilution titers were determined from log-transformed titration curves using 4-parameter non-linear regression and an OD cutoff value of 1.0.

Following this initial screening, 40 of the Spike-positive samples were further titrated to determine binding endpoint titers as an assessment of Ab affinity and/or quantity (Fig 1b) . Thirty-eight of 40 (95%) Spike-reactive samples exhibited positive IgA endpoint titers and 19 of these samples (50%) were \ufffd5 times higher than the endpoint titer of the positive cutoff value, and were therefore designated as 'high-titer' (Fig 1c) . Additionally, 20 samples assayed for Spike-specific IgA were also assessed for Spike-specific secretory Ab (by detecting for SC), and IgG. Nineteen of these undiluted milk specimens (95%) from convalescent COVID-19 donors were positive for Spike-specific secretory Abs compared to pre-pandemic control milk (Fig 2a) . One sample (COV125b) was negative for specific IgA but positive for specific secretory Ab, while another sample (COV123b) was positive for specific IgA but negative for specific secretory Ab. Eighteen undiluted milk samples (95%) exhibiting Spike-specific secretory Ab activity also exhibited positive endpoint titers (Fig 2c) . Of the samples found to be high-titer for Spike-specific IgA, 7 were also high-titer for specific secretory Ab (70%). Mean OD values for undiluted milk and endpoint titers were used in separate Spearman correlation tests to compare IgA and secretory Ab reactivity (Fig 2e) . It was found that IgA and secretory Ab levels were positively correlated (using ODs: r = 0.77, p<0.0001; using endpoint titers: r = 0.86, p<0.0001).

Neutralization capacity was tested using a Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)-based pseudovirus assay, wherein the native VSV surface protein G is replaced by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, as described previously ((13) ; Fig 4) . At the maximum concentration tested (200ug/mL total purified milk IgA), 6/8 (75%) COVID-19 samples exhibited >50% neutralization (mean, 87% neutralization; range, 70%-100%), while only 1/8 control samples (13%) achieved this benchmark (94% neutralization ; Fig 4a) . Mean percent neutralization values at 50ug/ml extracted IgA were grouped and compared among COVID-19 and pre-pandemic control samples. COVID-19 samples exhibited significantly greater neutralization compared to controls (p = 0.0064; Fig  4b) . As well, when the concentration of IgA required to achieve 50% neutralization (IC50) was determined, 7/8 pre-pandemic controls did not achieve 50% neutralization (IC50>200ug/mL while, for the COVID-19 samples, 2/8 did not achieve 50% neutralization, and the mean IC50 for the 6 COVID19 specimens that displayed neutralizing activity was 33.6ug/mL of total IgA (range, 2.39-89.4ug/mL; Fig 4c) . Finally, we compared the neutralization IC50 titers to the IgA endpoint titers measured for these samples (Fig 1) . There was a significant positive correlation between IgA binding and neutralization capacities (r = 0.83, p = 0.0154; Fig 4d) . Notably, the 2 non-neutralizing COVID-19 IgA samples also exhibited the lowest IgA endpoint titers (COV121, COV130; mean IgA endpoint titers of 19 and 17, respectively), while the 6 neutralizing samples exhibited high Spike-specific IgA binding titers (Figs 1c and 4c ).",

Here, we have significantly expanded our earlier work in which we reported on SARS-CoV-2 Ab prevalence among 75 COVID-19-recovered participants whose milk samples were obtained 4-6 weeks after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, we have confirmed among this much larger sample set that a SARS-CoV-2 IgA Ab response in milk after infection is very common. Our analysis of a subset of 20 milk samples from COVID-19-recovered participants suggests that this IgA response dominates compared to the measurable but relatively lower titer IgG response. Importantly, a very strong positive correlation was found between Spike-specific milk IgA and secretory Abs, using both ELISA OD values of Ab binding in undiluted milk as well as Ab binding endpoint titers, indicating that a very high proportion of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific IgA measured in milk after SARS-CoV-2 infection is sIgA, confirming our early reports. This is relevant for the effective protection of a breastfeeding infant, given the high durability of secretory Abs in the relatively harsh mucosal environments of the infant mouth and gut [7, 8] . These data are also relevant to the possibility of using extracted milk IgA as a COVID-19 therapy. Extracted milk sIgA used therapeutically would likely survive well upon targeted respiratory administration, with a much lower dose of Ab likely needed for efficacy compared to systemically-administered convalescent plasma or purified plasma immunoglobulin.",

Notably, even after 7-10 months, only 5 of 14 samples exhibited >10% decrease in specific IgA endpoint titers, while 8 of 14 samples actually exhibited an increase in specific IgA titer. These highly durable or even increased titers may be reflective of long-lived plasma cells in the GALT and/or mammary gland, as well as continued antigen stimulation in these compartments, possibly by other human coronaviruses, or repeated exposures to SARS-CoV-2.",

Notably, 67% of COVID-19-recovered participants reported their race/ ethnicity as white or Caucasian, and therefore this sample set is not diverse enough to be considered representative of the USA as a whole. More work needs to be done to obtain sufficient samples from non-white participants. Additionally, the longitudinal and functional components of these data were conducted on small number of samples, and further study will produce a more complete and accurate analysis. Neutralization and other functional analyses for all Ab classes also must be studied in follow-up samples.
