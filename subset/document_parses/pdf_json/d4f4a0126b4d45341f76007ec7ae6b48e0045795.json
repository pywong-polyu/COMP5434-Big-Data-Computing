Given the numbers of food insecure and malnourished people on the rise, the heterogeneity of nutritional statuses and needs, and the even worse context of COVID-19 pandemic, this has become an urgent challenge for food-related policies. This paper provides a comprehensive microsimulation approach to evaluate economic policies on food access, sufficiency (energy) and adequacy (protein, fat, carbohydrate) at household level. The improvement in market access conditions in Kenya is simulated as an application case of this method, using original insights from households' surveys and biochemical and nutritional information by food item. Simulation's results suggest that improving market access increases food purchasing power overall the country, with a pro-poor impact in rural areas. The daily energy consumption per capita and macronutrients intakes per capita increase at the national level, being the households with at least one stunted child under 5 years old, and poor households living areas outside Mombasa and Nairobi, those which benefit the most. The developed method and its Kenya's application contribute to the discussion on how to evaluate nutrition-sensitive policies, and how to cover most households suffering food insecurity and nutrition deficiencies in any given country.",

The challenge of ensuring access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food for all people all year round and eradicating all forms of malnutrition is increasingly complicated by the surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. Global estimates on food security and nutrition (FS&N) show that the global community is falling far short in this goal, with numbers of food insecure and malnourished people on the rise. Between 720 and 811 million people in the world faced hunger in 2020, and the global burden of malnutrition remained a challenge with 149 million of children stunted and 45 million wasted (FAO et al., 2021) .",

Agriculture can promote FS&N outcomes, but the linkages are complex, and influenced by diverse factors such as the food production systems, the market structures and consumer demands, as well as nutrition relevant policies and programs (Blesh et al., 2019; Pandey et al., 2016) . This complexity is a key reason explaining the challenge of measuring the impact of agricultural policies on FS&N (Qureshi et al., 2015) and the scarce evidence on the nutritional effect of agricultural interventions (Masset et al., 2012) . In addition, key gaps hinder the provision of this sound evidence. They are related to: (i) the scarcity of data availability, referring to specialized household surveys collecting economic related variables as well as detailed food consumption and nutrition data, (ii) the need to use proper metrics, and (iii) the call to build more nutrition-sensitive simulation models to gauge the FS&N impacts of large-scale policies and programs.",

Economic simulation models (Beyene et al., 2018; Boulanger et al., 2020; Deaton, 1989a Deaton, , 1989b Deaton, , 1997 Pauw et al., 2018) focus on poverty, welfare and food purchasing power as national or household agricultural policy impacts. On the other hand, medical microsimulation models target individuals and their households about the change in their nutrients intakes due to food polices to reduce health costs or diseases (Basu et al., 2013 (Basu et al., , 2018 Chi et al., 2014; Mozaffarian et al., 2018) . In this sense, each discipline tells the FS&N story from only one dimension of the problem. To measure the impact of policies on FS&N in a comprehensive manner, these two dimensions should be combined in a comprehensive microsimulation approach for a large coverage of FS&N issue. For nutrition, it is relevant to characterize households according to its members nutritional statuses (e.g., stunt children under 5 years old), and for food security, according to their food access (food purchasing power but also household diet diversity), food sufficiency (daily calories consumed compared to the average individual requirement), and food adequacy (nutrients intakes per capita per day compared to suggested requirements) dimensions. Household surveys and food composition tables are the basis to build FS&N indicators at the household level for this methodological approach.",

The current dietary intakes in Kenya show inadequate consumption of some food groups (i.e., vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds) and nutrients (i.e., iron and folic acid) (Development Initiatives, 2018) . The food security situation is also critical in the ASAL regions where 2.6 million people were estimated to be acutely food insecure in 2018 (Food Security Information Network, 2019) . The current food insecurity is attributed to the frequent droughts, but also to the high costs of domestic food production, in part triggered by the high costs of inputs. The high global food prices and low purchasing power of a large proportion of the population living in poverty are also critical drivers (Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, 2012) .

The resource constraints, the high costs of domestic food production, the volatility and the change in relative prices of food, determine both, the daily average caloric intakes and the dietary diversity of the households (Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, 2012). Deficiencies in micronutrients (e.g., vitamin A, iron, and zinc in East African countries) and macronutrients intakes (e.g., protein from animal sources in the SSA countries) are highly and positively correlated with calorie deficiency (Ecker et al., 2010) . Furthermore, the demand of food rich in those nutrients display high income elasticities (Desiere et al., 2018) .",

Since the 90's, benefiting from the seminal works of Deaton (1989a Deaton ( , 1989b Deaton ( , 1997 , a vast empirical economic literature emerged on the change in agriculture income and prices on poverty impact by applying microeconomic approaches using household surveys. However, this literature only addresses purchasing power dimension without getting into the nutritional dimension of the FS&N problem. On the other side, a rich medical literature employs microsimulation approaches with individual and household surveys to develop FS&N indicators (e.g., Food Security Score, Body mass index, nutrients intakes such as potassium, sodium or fat) and considering pre-existent diseases (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases in adults, and caries epidemic in children) to evaluate health cost-saving of food policies (e.g., banned/taxes on sugar-based food and beverages; subsidies on fruits and vegetables). Nutrition and consumption quality is the core of this literature, but it does not account for any purchasing power dimension (Basu et al., 2013 (Basu et al., , 2018 Chi et al., 2014; Mozaffarian et al., 2018) . Finally, the literature on macro-microsimulation models appears as a better combination for both, agricultural policy simulation and FS&N household impact (Cockburn et al., 2014) . Simulation models (e.g., partial and general equilibrium models) evaluate the consequences of a policy shock over macroeconomic, average agents and sector variables, while linked microsimulation models allow to exploit households' heterogeneity (i.e., preferences, endowments, members composition, anthropometric measures of its members, etc.) to also compute distributional effects on FS&N indicators. Nonetheless, economic papers based on this combined approach are still oriented to welfare and food access dimension (Beyene et al., 2018; Boulanger et al., 2020; Pauw et al., 2018) , lacking the biological-nutritional dimension (i.e., macro and micro-nutrients; nutritional and health statuses of household members). Nechifor et al. (2021) is the recent exception quantifying the COVID-19 restrictions and policies impact on welfare, daily calories and macronutrients intakes per capita.",

This combination can only be achieved joining, knowledge of the biology-nutrition and economics disciplines to find and refine FS&N metrics at individual and household levels. These are the challenges to quantify the impact of agricultural policies with more completeness to the FS&N analysis (Qureshi et al., 2015) . Even when assessments of agricultural interventions on nutrition outcomes highlight a scarce evidence to advise on the prioritisation among competing nutrition-sensitive agricultural policies (Masset et al., 2012) , literature results point out that improving commercialisation channels (e.g., transport infra-structureAtack et al., 2009; Donaldson & Hornbeck, 2016; Zeller et al., 1998) could lead to positive impact on farmers' income and food access (Chege et al., 2015) , on nutrition (Carletto et al., 2017) and on diet diversity (Koppmair et al., 2017) , enhancing access to higher-value nutritious foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and animal-source products, which are more perishable than staple foods (Muthini et al., 2020) . Improving food access with region-specific public policies could tackle nutritional deficits locally avoiding intensifying elsewhere (Desiere et al., 2018; Ecker et al., 2010) .",

Some steps are essential in the definition and implementation of the methodological approach. First, the definition of the relevant FS&N indicators and the data collection to construct them at the household level. Second, the evaluation of the availability of data sources and their treatments for consistency. Finally, the linkages between the FS&N microsimulation approach based on these indicators and the requirements for its implementation for a policy evaluation.

These results are then introduced, as exogenous changes, in the microsimulation module. For the application case included in this paper, a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model provides this first input. The CGE model is a comparative static variant of the STatic Applied General Equilibrium model (STAGE) (McDonald, 2021) and its extension for the context of developing countries (STAGE-DEV) (McDonald et al., 2016) . In particular, STAGE-DEV accounts for the nonseparability of the dual roles of smallholders as producers and consumers. Subsistence farmers produce their Home Production for Home Consumption (HPHC) allocating labour and capital for own consumption.

Investments to improve infrastructure leads to lower transaction costs associated with agricultural activities with a potential to reduce the cost of accessing inputs (Dercon et al., 2009) . Better infrastructure and improved market access can thus reduce consumer prices, increase the share of value added accruing to farmers and increase domestic production of marketed commodities. This scenario is simulated within a CGE framework consistent in terms of data sources and sectoral/geographical details for Kenya. The model is calibrated with a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) of Kenya in 2014 . Under this scenario, the domestic trade and transport margins fall by 30% in exchange for an investment of 4 billion of Kenyan Shillings to improve infrastructure, financed by government savings. The cost to transport fertilizers input decrease by 30%; as better roads would make their delivery cheaper (Minten et al., 2013) . Farmers will then increase the use of fertilizers and increase their productivity. In addition, trade costs of agricultural commodities would fall by the same amount. Even in this case, the magnitude of the shock looks plausible (Key et al., 2000) , in particular given the amount of the investment planned and the size of trade margins in the country . Moreover, the elasticities estimated by Benin et al. (2008) support the size of this shock. 2",
