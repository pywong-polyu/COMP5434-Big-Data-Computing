Methods The regional register for A&E admissions and hospitalizations has been reviewed in order to compare the number of A&D admission, the triage colour codes rates, aetiology of trauma, number of patients hospitalized for trauma, number of fractures that required surgery, type of fractures and injuries and mean patients' age. Results During lockdown 7314 patients were admitted in A&E, while 22,508 patients were admitted in 2019. In 2020 and 2019 triage codes were respectively distributed as follows: red code 0.1% vs 0.2%, yellow code 8.9% vs 6.3%, green code 84% vs 84.7% and white code 6% vs 8.8%. (p = 0.042). The number of hospitalized patients for trauma was 670 in 2020, while in 2019 was 1774 (p = 0.02). The most common fracture that required surgery was femur fracture (409 in 2020 vs 635 in 2019); fracture subtype distribution and mean age of the patients were significantly different in the two groups (respectively p < 0.01 and p = 0.02). Conclusions One month of lockdown showed a 68% decrease in the number of A&E visits and a 74% decrease of fractures that required surgery. Femur fracture showed the lowest decrease moving from 635 to 409 units but increasing their incidence rate (42 to 61%).",

We set out this study to examine the implications of COVID19 lockdown in trauma patients in an Italian region of four million people (Piedmont). After the spread out of the COVID19 virus, in Italy the first lockdowns began around 21 February 2020 [2] , covering a single province in Lombardy; later on the 8 March 2020 [3] , Italian prime minister announced the expansion of the quarantine zone to cover much of northern Italy including the full Piedmont region. The lockdown restricted travel from, to or within the affected areas, banned funerals and cultural events, and requiring people to keep at least 1 m of distance from one another in public locations. People would still be able to use trains and planes to and from the region only for \"proven work needs, emergencies, or health reasons.\" On 22 March, Italian prime minister announced a further enlargement of the lockdown, by shutting down all non-necessary businesses and industries [4] . The aim of this study is to report the trauma workload during COVID19 lockdown in a region of four million people and to compare it with the same period in 2019.",

These reductions are related to decreasing in road traffic (55% less on Italian highways on March 2020 [10] ), outdoor activities and workplace injuries. On the other hand, the incidence rate of finger wounds increased significantly (+50%) that may be due to the increase of the home hobbies during the lockdown: food processing equipment, lawn mower and power saw (activities usually practiced at home) are reported among the top 5 mechanisms in those aged over 15 years in non-lockdown period [11] ).",

            "text": "Our results showed also a decrease of 74% in the overall number of fractures that required surgery. The decreased road traffic and outdoor activities may play a central role in the interpretation of this finding. Although not unexpected, we must underline that femur fracture showed a decrease in the absolute numbers (moving from 635 to 409 units), but it was the only fracture that increased its distribution rate among all the surgical fractures (from 42 to 61%). This may justify the significant increase of mean patients age between 2019 and 2020 (73.2 vs 83.5 years p = 0.02). According to our opinion and as showed in literature [12] , age is directly related to fracture mechanism: fractures due to bone fragility rather than severe injury are uncommon in young adults [13] . Locking-down reduced the mobility of mild-elderly patients who are not getting outside their home so much reducing the incidence of their femur fractures. Instead, older patients fall at home as before COVID19 pandemic. Furthermore, among femur fractures, subtrochanteric fractures significantly increased their incidence (9% in 2019 vs 22% in 2020, p < 0.01). This finding agrees with the highest incidence of those fractures in fragile patients: Peritrochanteric femur fractures typically occur in a physiologically older population than femoral neck fractures [14] . According to our point of view, femur fractures during lockdown were restricted to fragile patients because the more active patients at risk of falling during outdoor daily activities reduced their movements during the lockdown and occurred less frequently in femur fracture. This theory also justify that mean age in femur fracture patient was 83.6 years (SD 12.2) in 2019 and 87.3 year (10.2) in 2020 (p = 0.02). Further studies should focus on the American Society of Anesthesiologists-ASA score to confirm or deny our hypothesis: femoral fractures during lockdown are restricted to more fragile patients. This hypothesis is in line with Gumina et al. study [15] where elderly subjects remain exposed to shoulder and elbow trauma due to low-energy (domestic) falls.",
