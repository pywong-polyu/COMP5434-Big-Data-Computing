Here we report a non-canonical, essential function for stimulator of interferon genes (STING) during HRV infections. While the canonical function of STING is to detect cytosolic DNA and activate inflammatory responses, HRV infection triggers the release of STIM1-bound STING in the ER by lowering Ca 2+ , thereby allowing STING to interact with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and traffic to ROs to facilitates viral replication and transmission via autophagy. Our results thus hint a critical function of STING in HRV viral replication and transmission, with possible implications for other RO-mediated RNA viruses.",

Originally neglected, as they were considered less virulent and capable only of causing mild common cold symptoms. It is only recently that they have been recognised to be important causative agents of acute upper and lower respiratory infections, wheezing, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, exacerbations of both asthma and COPD [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , as well as severe respiratory disease 6 . Together with coronaviruses, RVs are responsible for the majority of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in all age groups [7] [8] [9] as well as being a major cause of morbidity in infants, young children and the elderly 9, 10 . In the United States alone, HRV causes 500 million non-influenza viral respiratory infections, resulting in a huge socioeconomic burden with estimated direct costs of USD $17 billion and indirect costs of $22.5 billion annually 11 .",

Although part of the DNA sensing machinery STING has been previously shown to be implicated in responses against RNA viruses 23 . It has been shown that cells lacking STING are more sensitive to RNA virus infection and that during those infections, STING plays a role in inhibiting the translation machinery to limit the RNA viral synthesis 24 . Crosstalk between RNA RLRs, such as RIG-I and MDA5, and STING has also been implied from studies with HIV-1 25, 26 , HTLV-1 27 , and Dengue 28, 29 .

            "text": "STING activation seems to rely on its location within the cell. When STING localizes to the ER and is bound by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) it is rendered inactive 30 . Upon activation, STING traffics from the ER to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), where STING-mediated TBK1/ Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3) signalling occurs 31 . STING activation needs to be regulated and excessive STING signalling is implicated in severe sterile inflammatory conditions 31, 32 . Thus, STIM1 regulates STING trafficking and activation by directly interacting with STING to retain it in an inactive state on the ER membrane. STIM1 is an ER calcium sensor and when the ER Ca 2+ stores are depleted, STIM1 moves to the ER-plasma membrane (PM) junction sites, where it binds to calcium releaseactivated calcium channel protein 1 (CRCM1 (Orai1)) and opens Ca 2+ release-activated Ca 2+ (CRAC) channel to allow Ca 2+ influx 30 . The small hydrophobic HRV 2B protein targets the ER and the Golgi complex to reduce Ca 2+ levels 33, 34 . Here, we have discovered that during HRV infection, HRV 2B reduces the ER and Golgi complex stored Ca 2+ forcing STIM1 to leave the ER, thus releasing STING. Once released, STING can bind PI4P via a patch of positively charged residues and is recruited to the RO, inhibiting downstream immune responses. STING can bind to phosphatidylserine (PS) autophagosomal vesicles which provide a cellular exit point for the virus, elucidating a role for STING as a homeostatic regulator between PI4P/PS lipid exchange. This study highlights a critical role for STING in HRV viral replication and transmission, involved in lipid recognition and homeostasis, with possible implications for other RO-mediated viruses, such as coronavirus.",

To determine whether PI4K was required for HRV infection, we firstly investigated whether PI4KIII\u03b1 or PI4KIII\u03b2 co-localize with ROs and the HRV dsRNA. As expected, our data showed colocalization of PI4KIII\u03b2 with the dsRNA associated with the RO upon HRV infection (Supplemental Fig. 1e ). To assess this further, we utilised the GSK inhibitors GSK2998533, a PI4KIII\u03b2 antagonist, and GSK268449 and PIK93, PI4KIII\u03b1 antagonists, in both confocal microscopy (Supplemental Fig. 1e ) and viral replication assays (Supplemental Fig. 1f ). GSK3000140 was used as an inactive negative control compound. It was clear that inhibition of PI4KIII\u03b2 strongly reduced colocalization of dsRNA to STING, as well as diminishing viral replication.",

STIM1, is a Ca 2+ binding protein which localizes throughout the ER when [Ca 2+ ] ER is high, but, after depletion of the ER Ca 2+ stores, it translocates into junctional areas between the ER and plasma membrane and interacts with the pore subunit of store-operated Ca 2+ channels, CRCM1, and induces Ca 2+ entry 30 .",

In the past few decades, the importance of RVs in upper and lower respiratory infections, pneumonias, wheezing, and exacerbations of asthma and COPD has become apparent. Despite its socioeconomic impact the broad variety of RV genotypes has represented a major obstacle in the development of specific vaccines or antiviral agents for RVs. In the current study, STING has been found to be crucial for viral replication across all RV serotypes, demonstrating a very novel therapeutic avenue.",

Fluorescence was measured every 2 s with the excitation wavelength alternating between 340 and 380 nm and the emission fluorescence being recorded at 492 nm. At the end of the experiment, a region free of cells was selected, and one averaged background frame was collected at each excitation wavelength for background correction. To measure the [Ca 2+ ] of the stores, the amount of thapsigargin-releasable Ca 2+ was determined. After recording the cells in Ca 2+ -containing HT buffer, the medium was replaced with Ca 2+ -free HT buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM EGTA.
