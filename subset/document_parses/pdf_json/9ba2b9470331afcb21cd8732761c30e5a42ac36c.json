Extensions of the standard Immersed Boundary (IB) Method are proposed so that the fluid media may satisfy partial slip or free-slip conditions on the moving boundary. Our numerical results indicate that slip may lead to substantial speed enhancement for swimmers in a viscoelastic fluid and in a viscoelastic two-fluid mixture. Under the slip conditions, the speed of locomotion is dependent in a nontrivial way on both the viscosity and elasticity of the fluid media. In a two-fluid mixture with free-slip network, the swimming speed is also significantly affected by the drag coefficient and the network volume fraction.",

Examples include the locomotion of E.coli in intestinal fluid [1] , and the swimming of mammalian spermatozoa within cervical mucus in the process of reproduction [2] . Such problems involve the dynamical interactions between elastic boundaries and a complex fluid medium, which often exhibits complicated Non-Newtonian responses. Recent theoretical, experimental and computational investigations are characterized by the complexity of different ways in which biological locomotion may depend on fluid properties. Analysis of the infinite undulatory sheet with small amplitude found that fluid elasticity always reduces the swimming speed [3] . Further analytical work indicated that swimming can be boosted by elasticity under specified gaits [4] . Numerical simulations of finite swimmers with large amplitude of motion showed that swimming speed may be enhanced by elasticity [5] . Experimentally, the self-propulsion of C. elegans was observed to be hindered significantly in viscoelastic fluid [6] . However, the artificial swimmers in [7] exhibited systematic elastic speed-ups. In [8] and [9] , it was shown that favorable stroke asymmetry, swimmer body dynamics and fluid elasticity may work together to cause increases in speed.",

No-slip boundary condition is assumed on the swimmer's surface so that the fluid medium always moves together with the swimmer. Such models and assumptions may not be appropriate for many applications. First, biological fluids such as mucus are mixtures of a solvent and a polymer network. There may be significant relative motions between different components within the mixture so that it can not be adequately described by a single phase continuum medium [10] . Furthermore, it has been long known that slip may occur for polymer solutions near a solid boundary. This can be caused by the phase separation over the solvent-rich boundary region where the polymer phase is driven away [11] . Recent studies highlight the importance of boundary conditions and fluid models in locomotion problems. The analysis in [12] examined swimming in a medium consisting of a mixture of a Newtonian fluid and an elastic solid. Both elastic speed-up and slow-down can be obtained, depending on the type of boundary conditions imposed. In [13] , it was shown analytically that the introduction of apparent slip or the reduction of fluid viscosity near the swimmer in Newtonian fluids may lead to faster swimming. In [14] and [15] , different variations of the Immersed Boundary Method were proposed to simulate interactions between elastic boundaries and a two-phase medium. Despite these advances, a comprehensive analysis for the role of slip on swimmers in viscoelastic media is lacking.",

Note that the slip velocity in [13] is proportional to the shear rate, instead of the shear stress. So the slip length \u039b as defined in [13] is related to our slip coefficient by \u039b = 2\u03bc s \u039e. From Fig. 1 , it is clear that the numerical swimming speed increases linearly with the slip coefficient. And our simulation results agree well with the analytical solution. Next, we study the effect of slip on the swimmer in a viscoelastic medium. We carry out simulations with different slip coefficients under three fixed values of the relaxation time \u03bb = 2, \u03bb = 0.2, and \u03bb = 0.05, respectively. The polymer viscosity is fixed at \u03bc p = 2. The scaled swimming speed U U0 is plotted as the function of the slip coefficient in Fig. 2(a) . Here the Deborah Number defined as De = \u03bb\u03c9 is used to quantify the fluid elasticity. Note that in the plot, the analytical solution is plotted from (14), with \u03bc s replaced by the total viscosity of the fluid \u03bc s + \u03bc p . The numerical results indicate that apparent slip always enhances the swimming speed in a viscoelastic fluid. It seems that for a fixed Deborah Number, the swimming speed increases linearly with the slip coefficient \u039e, which is similar to the swimmer in a viscous fluid. For the same slip coefficient, the swimming speed decreases with the increase of the fluid elasticity. As the Deborah Number De \u2192 0, the numerical solutions approach asymptotically to the analytical solution for the viscous fluid. Next, we fix the relaxation time \u03bb = 0.2 and study the influence of polymer viscosity on swimming under different slip coefficients. As shown in Fig. 2(b) , when \u039e = 0, the swimming speed decreases monotonically with the increase of \u03bc p . The result matches well with the analytical solution given by (15) [3] . When the slip coefficient is moderately increased to 0.02, the swimming speed is not significantly impacted by the change of \u03bc p . And the variation is no longer monotone. For larger \u039e values of 0.05 and 0.1, greater values of \u03bc p always lead to a faster swimmer, whose speed changes more dramatically with \u03bc p than the one with smaller \u039e. Overall, the simulation results indicate that there exists a slip threshold beyond which the polymer viscosity can benefit swimming. In Fig. 3(a) , a different scaling is used for the same swimming speed U shown in Fig. 2(a) . Here U no\u2212slip is the analytical second order swimming speed for an infinite sheet in an Oldroyd-B fluid (without slip) [3] : ",

Interestingly, for a fixed \u03bc p , the numerical results with different Deborah Numbers all match well with the analytical solution with De = 0. Therefore, for the range of parameters tested in this work, our results indicate that the relative slip boost for the infinite waving sheet is similar for a single phase viscous and a single phase viscoelastic fluid (with fixed fluid viscosity). In Fig. 3(b) , the scaled speed is plotted for a fixed ratio of polymer viscosity to relaxation time \u03bcp \u03bb = 1. Here the analytical solution is plotted from (14) without viscosity contribution from the polymer (\u03bc p = 0). For fixed \u03bc s and \u03c9, the ratio \u03bcp \u03bb measures the relative contribution of the polymeric stress to the force balance in fluid [5] . It is clear that for the same slip coefficient, the relative speed boost increases with the increase of Deborah Number. As the values of \u03bc p and \u03bb decrease, the fluid behaves more like a viscous fluid with viscosity \u03bc s .

In this work, we propose an extension to the method which allows the elastic structure to slip through one of the materials in the mixture. As shown in Fig. 5 , the infinite sheet is represented by the immersed boundary \u0393 s , where the associated IB points X s (q, t) move with local solvent velocity u s (no-slip condition). A \"virtual IB\" \u0393 n is introduced to enforce the no-penetration condition for the network fluid on the boundary. Material points on the virtual IB are denoted by X n (q, t), which move with local network velocity u n . As indicated in the figure, each X n is connected by a stiff spring (with zero rest length) to a corresponding \"anchor point\" X a n located on \u0393 s . Similarly, each X s is connected to an anchor point X a s located on \u0393 n . The resulting force penalizes separation between \u0393 s and \u0393 n in the normal direction, without penalizing the relative motion tangential to the sheet surface. Using an analog of (7), Lagrangian force on \u0393 s is distributed only to the solvent fluid and Lagrangian force on \u0393 n is distributed only to the network fluid. In (17) and (18), the Eulerian force densities have the form f s = \u03b8 s SF o s + \u03b8 s \u03b8 n SF p s and f n = \u03b8 n SF o n + \u03b8 s \u03b8 n SF p n . Here S is the force spreading operator defined before. \u2022 \u2212 Xn, \u2212 X a s , \u2212 X a n . Xn and Xs are material points on the boundary. X a s and X a n are anchor points to enforce the no-penetration boundary condition for the network fluid. F p s and F p n are penalty forces on \u0393 s and \u0393 n , respectively. At each IB point and the associated anchor point, we have F p s = \u2212F p n . The spread contributions from the penalty forces are scaled by the product of the volume-fractions \u03b8 s \u03b8 n so that no penalty force is applied if either of the volume fractions goes to zero. This also ensures that the total net penalty forces applied to the two fluids approximately add up to zero, provided that an IB point and its anchor point are always close (small normal separation between \u0393 n and \u0393 s ). Other Lagrangian forces F o s and F o n are scaled by the fluid's volume fraction after they are spread to that fluid. These include forces from the springs connecting an IB point to its two neighbors. Additionally, F o s also include forces from the springs connecting \u0393 s to tether points with prescribed waving motion.",

            "text": "In step 1, F p s and F p n are computed at and spread from all IB and anchor points. For a specific X s , the associated anchor point X a s is defined as the point on the piece-wise linear boundary \u0393 n such that ||X s \u2212 X a s || is the shortest distance between X s and \u0393 n . The anchor point X a n on \u0393 s for X n is identified similarly. In step 3, a multigrid preconditioned GMRES solver is used to solve the linear system [22] . All simulation parameters such as computational domain, grid size and time step are the same as ones used in Sect. 2.3. For all simulations, we set the viscosity values to \u03bc s = \u03bc n = 1.0. In the first set of test, we fix the drag coefficient \u03be = 1.0 and fluid volume fractions \u03b8 s = \u03b8 n = 0.5. The influence of relaxation time on swimming is studied for three different values of polymer viscosities \u03bc p = 0.5, \u03bc p = 2 and \u03bc p = 4. In Fig. 6(a) and (b) , the relative velocity u n \u2212 u s and the stress component \u03c3 12 p are plotted for \u03bc p = 0.5 and \u03bc p = 2, respectively, at t = 12. In both plots, the relative velocity is approximately tangent to the sheet, indicating the boundary condition is properly enforced. With a larger polymer viscosity, the stress component has larger magnitude while the motion of the network relative to the solvent fluid is less significant. The scaled swimming speed is shown in Fig. 7(a) as the function of \u03bb for different values of \u03bc p . The plots indicate that the sheet always swims much faster in the mixture than in a viscous fluid, even when the mixture contains a highly elastic network. For fixed polymer viscosity, the increase of the network elasticity monotonically hinders the swimming speed. For a fixed \u03bb, the sheet moves faster in mixtures with larger values of \u03bc p . The speed enhancement due to polymer viscosity is more significant for less elastic mixture. Next, we carry out simulations in which both \u03bc p and \u03bb are varied while the values of their ratio \u03bcp \u03bb remain fixed. As seen from Fig. 7(b) , with fixed \u03bcp \u03bb , the swimming speed is always moderately enhanced when \u03bc p and \u03bb increase with the same rate. Together with the data shown in Fig. 2(b) , our simulation results suggest that for a swimmer that is allowed to slip through a viscoelastic material (or mixture of materials), the speed of locomotion is dependent in a nontrivial way on both the viscosity and elasticity of the material. In Fig. 8(a) , the swimming speed is plotted as the function of the drag coefficient \u03be for \u03b8 n = 0.5. The sheet moves slower with the increase of drag. For a drag coefficient of \u03be = 10 4 , the swimming speed is about 60% of that in a viscous fluid. In Fig. 8(b) , U U0 is plotted for different network volume fraction \u03b8 n with \u03be fixed at 1. The increase of the network volume fraction in the mixture leads to significant swimming speed-ups. In a separate test with no-slip network, we observe smaller swimming speed with the increase of \u03b8 n (result not shown). ",

For swimmers in a viscoelastic fluid, interpolated fluid velocities are modified using tangential components of the Lagrange force to account for the partial slip condition. This can be thought as the single-phase version of the force calculation strategy proposed in [15] . In a viscoelastic two-fluid mixture, a dual IB representation of the immersed structure is used where the free-slip condition is enforced through a penalty method. Instead of the projection-based fractional step methods as used in [15] , we solve the momentum equations and the incompressibility constraint simultaneously. This makes it more straightforward to enforce the velocity boundary conditions. Furthermore, our method can be directly applied to problems where fluid volume fractions are spatially variable. For such problems, methods for Stokes equations that decouple the velocity and the pressure, such as the pressure-Poisson formulation, can not be used. Our numerical results show that: (1) Slip may lead to substantial speed enhancement for the swimmer in a viscoelastic fluid or two-fluid mixture relative to the swimmer in a no-slip viscous fluid.",
