To fight against the spread of this virus, clinical image analysis of chest CT (computed tomography) images can play an important role for an accurate diagnostic. In the present work, a bi-modular hybrid model is proposed to detect COVID-19 from the chest CT images. In the first module, we have used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to extract features from the chest CT images. In the second module, we have used a bi-stage feature selection (FS) approach to find out the most relevant features for the prediction of COVID and non-COVID cases from the chest CT images. At the first stage of FS, we have applied a guided FS methodology by employing two filter methods: Mutual Information (MI) and Relief-F, for the initial screening of the features obtained from the CNN model. In the second stage, Dragonfly algorithm (DA) has been used for the further selection of most relevant features. The final feature set has been used for the classification of the COVID-19 and non-COVID chest CT images using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed model has been tested on two open-access datasets: SARS-CoV-2 CT images and COVID-CT datasets and the model shows substantial prediction rates of 98.39% and 90.0% on the said datasets respectively. The proposed model has been compared with a few past works for the prediction of COVID-19 cases. The supporting codes are uploaded in the Github link: https://github.com/ Soumyajit-Saha/A-Bi-Stage-Feature-Selection-on-Covid-19-Dataset",

The general symptoms of COVID-19 disease include fever with cough, fatigue, and breathing problem, loss of taste and smell [5] . Mohamadou et al. in [6] presented a review on COVID-19 that includes various medical images, case reports, management strategies, etc. According to the authors, both mathematical modelling and AI techniques can be considered as reliable tools to fight against COVID-19 disease. According to the authors in [7] , chest X-ray and CT-scan images (radiological images) may play an important role for accurate diagnosis of this disease. A few radiologists suggest chest X-ray images to diagnose COVID-19 cases because maximum radiological laboratories and hospitals have X-ray machines through which the chest images of the patients can be achieved easily [8] . However, chest X-ray images can not distinguish the soft tissues perfectly [9] . To overcome this problem, CTscan images are used which can detect such soft tissues efficiently. Several researchers [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] have demonstrated the effectiveness of using CT images for the proper diagnosis of COVID-19 affected person.",

Initially, a CNN model has been used to generate the features from the chest CT images. However, the dimension of feature vector generated is quite large (800 feature attributes). Hence, we have proposed a bistage FS approach to select the optimal feature subset. In the first stage, two different filter methods called Mutual Information (MI) and ReliefF are used to rank the feature attributes. As the ranking of the attributes are diverse and sometimes data dependent, we ensemble the output of filter based techniques by taking the union of top-n ranked features of each method. This ensemble technique combines the information produced by these two rankings into a common subset. we have used a meta-heuristic algorithm called Dragonfly algorithm (DA) [20] based FS method in the second step for the optimization of the feature set generated in first stage. This optimal feature subset is fed to SVM classifier for the prediction purpose.",

In [29] , Tang et al. considered the chest CT images as an important component for the assessment of COVID-19 severity. The authors proposed an ML-based technique for the assessment of COVID-19 severity from the chest CT images and achieved 87.5% classification accuracy. Farid et al. [33] demonstrated the analysis of Corona disease virus on the basis of a probabilistic model. Their proposed methodology extract features from chest CT images for the prediction of COVID-19 disease. They used a combination of statistical and ML-based methods to extract features from CT images and achieved 96.07% recognition accuracy. He et al [28] proposed a Self-Trans approach that combines self-supervised learning and transfer learning approach to produce powerful and unbiased features that helps to achieved 86% recognition accuracy. Loey et al. [58] presented classical data augmentation techniques with Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGAN) and predicted COVID-19 using a deep transfer learning model with 82.9% correct classification accuracy. Mobiny et al. [60] integrates the power of Capsule Networks with different architectures for the improvement of classification accuracy. Their proposed model classify the COVID-19 cases with 87.6% accuracy. Different DL-based techniques have been adopted by the Authors [61, 62, 64] to improve the prediction capability of COVID-19 cases. Authors in [63] proposed a deep uncertainty-aware TL framework for the prediction of COVID-19 using medical images. Authors have used VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionResNetV2 to extract deep features from the images. The features are then fed to different ML and statistical model for final classification purpose and achieved 87.9% accuracy. The approach proposed by Ewen et al. [65] aims to determine whether the self supervision strategy is a good option for COVID-19 prediction. The methodology proposed by the authors [28, 58, 60] for the prediction of COVID-19 has lower recognition rate. Work mentioned in [61] used light CNN for the prediction purpose hence it is less time consuming but recognition accuracy is low. Whereas, works mentioned in [62, 64] achieves better recognition accuracy but consumes more time. To reduce the overall classification time and also to work with small dataset, authors in [63] used TL-based technique and achieved descent outcome.",

In this regard, ML, DL and TL based approaches have made a significant contribution to the computer based COVID-19 screening. However, it has been observed that DL-based techniques are slow, and some of the past methods produce lower recognition accuracy. On the other hand, FSbased approaches are able to make the model more robust by eliminating the features which do not contribute much to the classification process. As a result, time required to train the model gets reduced and classification accuracy of the learning model gets enhanced. Keeping these facts in mind, in the current study, a bi-stage classification model has been proposed where CNN is involved for feature extraction, guided-FS is used for the initial screening of the features coming from CNN and lastly, the DA-based FS technique is used to select the most relevant features for the better prediction of COVID-19 cases.",

Figure 1 highlights the working procedure of the proposed model. At the beginning of our algorithm, we consider CNN as a feature extractor. The CNN applied on the chest CT images produces 800 feature attributes. As the produced feature set is of high dimension, a bistage FS approach is applied to select the most relevant features. In the first stage, a guided-FS technique is applied where the features generated from CNN are ranked by two filter methods namely MI and ReliefF separately. Different filter based techniques rank the feature attributes differently because the rule of assigning the rank is different for the two filter methods. Hence, we utilize a simple ensemble technique by taking the union of the top-n features produced by these two filter based methods. The resultant feature set is then passed through DA for the selection of final and more optimal feature subset in the second stage. This optimized feature subset is then used for the prediction of COVID and non-COVID chest CT images.",

These hidden layers consist of a series of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers that try to detect and learn very complex features and patterns belonging to the images of a particular class. These are the reason for tremendous success of CNN models in field of computer vision and its various applications. Even though CNN performs great in the task of image classification, there are a couple of limitation to this. Firstly, Fig. 1 Flowchart of the proposed model for the prediction of COVID and non-COVID cases from chest CT images to provide more accurate predictions, the CNN model needs to be trained on a large dataset to include a different kind of possible variations. However, as of now, large sized datasets are not publicly available which can be used for DL based COVID-19 screening. Hence, in the current work, instead of using the CNN model for the prediction of COVID cases, we have used it for extraction of powerful features, and then the feature vector so obtained is passed to the bi-stage FS technique followed by a SVM classifier based classification of the input chest CT images.",

The wrapper methods are often used in coalition with a ML algorithm, where the impact of the feature attributes are validated by the learning algorithms, which in turn select the optimal feature subsets to augment the classification accuracy.

It has rendered accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and AUC values of 95.77%, 0.9409, 0.9755, 0.9579 and 0.9856 respectively for SARS-CoV-2 CT scan dataset, and 85.33%, 0.8833, 0.7794, 0.8281 and 0.9244 respectively for COVID-CT dataset. Hence, it can be said that the proposed guided-FS technique has efficiently performed the initial screening [16, 17, 28, 34, 58, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . Hence, it can be inferred that the proposed bi-stage FS algorithm has the ability to predict COVID-19 with more perfection then its predecessors. We have performed Wilcoxon rank-sum test [67] for the statistical significance test of the obtained results. In this non-parametric statistical test pairwise comparison is performed. For each pair, we have considered the accuracy achieved by our proposed method and the results reported by other methods on the same database. The working principle of Wilcoxon signed-rank test is as follows:",

In this work, we proposed a model in which CNN serves as a feature extractor and a bi-stage FS procedure serves as a mechanism to select the features with most relevance for the prediction of COVID-19 accurately from the chest CT images of the patient. Our proposed model was experimented on two publicly available COVID-19 datasets mentioned earlier and can identify the disease with 98.39% and 90.0% classification accuracy. Although our proposed model works better compared to other existing methods as mentioned in Table 6 , still there exist some scopes to improve the overall performance by minimizing the error cases. After an exhaustive analysis of the misclassified cases, we observed that the lack of ample historical COVID data and the poor quality of some images may be the probable causes. In our future works, we aim to augment the prediction accuracy of the system by introducing other filter and wrapper combinations. We have also planned to work with other COVID datasets. Another possible target would be to use some well-established pre-trained CNN models to have better features at the initial stage.",
