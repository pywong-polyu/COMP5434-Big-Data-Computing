            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) services hard worldwide as it is considered an elective procedure and hence has been given less importance. Other reasons include the risk of transmission of infections, lack of resources, and the scarcity of anesthesiologists due to their diversion to intensive care units to manage COVID-19 patients. However, ECT is an urgent and life-saving measure for patients diagnosed with depression and other severe mental illnesses who have suicidality, catatonia, or require a rapid therapeutic response. COVID-19 pandemic is a significant source of stress for individuals due to its impact on health, employment, and social support resulting in new-onset psychiatric illnesses and the worsening of a pre-existing disorder. Hence, a continuation of the ECT services during the COVID-19 pandemic is of paramount importance. In this narrative review, the authors from India have compiled the literature on the ECT practice during the COVID-19 pandemic related to the screening and testing protocol, necessity of personal protective equipment, modification in ECT Suite, electrical stmulus settings, and anesthesia technique modification. The authors have also shared their experiences with the ECT services provided at their institute during this pandemic. This description will help other institutes to manage the ECT services uninterruptedly and make ECT a safe procedure during the current pandemic.",

New-onset psychiatric illnesses and the worsening of pre-existing disorders have emerged in this background (Andrade, 2020; Rajkumar, 2020) . Unfortunately, the ensuing lockdown during the COVID19 outbreak led to restrictions in people's movement and difficulty accessing ECT services in India (Grover et al., 2020) and across the globe (Amad et al., 2020; Sienaert et al., 2020; Tor et al., 2020a, b) . Many centers worldwide also stopped ECT services with the pandemic's onset due to fear of causing the spread of COVID-19. Another major obstacle in providing ECT services was the shortage of anesthesiologists secondary to their deputation to intensive care units to treat sick patients who have tested positive for COVID (Espinoza et al., 2020; Gil-Badenes et al., 2020) . Due to the limited availability of ECT services, worsening of pre-existing psychiatric illnesses, including suicides, was recorded (Vindegaard and Benros, 2020; Tor et al., 2020a, b) .",

The ECT under anesthesia is an aerosol-generating procedure with the associated risk of infection transmission to the health care workers (HCWs), supporting staff, and fellow patients (Tran et al., 2012; Anelli et al., 2020; Purushothaman et al., 2020) . The time points with high vulnerability are listed below -1) Pre-anesthetic consultation (PAC): Doctors come close to the patients for clinical examination (physical distancing is difficult) 2) Administration of anesthesia: During bag and mask ventilation (BMV) and airway instrumentations (Guedal airway, laryngeal mask airway, endotracheal intubation), there is a high risk of aerosol generation 3) Recovery from anesthesia: Suctioning of oral secretions, airway handling (ex: jaw thrust), and instrumentation in case of airway obstruction and coughing during recovery from anesthesia generate aerosols and contaminate the ECT suite. 4) Prolonged airway care: In situations like arterial desaturation, prolonged apnea, and bronchospasm, airway interventions are required, and the anesthesiologist needs to spend more time with the patients nearby. Such scenarios are more common in obese and elderly patients with associated comorbidities. 5) In a rare situation, if a patient sustains cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 6) Handling of equipment like breathing circuits, face mask, anesthesia machine, and vital sign monitors between cases can contaminate these equipment. These can act as fomites and transmit infection among HCWs while checking the equipment and during cleaning.",

The contributing factors for these differences include the pandemic stage, the phase of lockdown, the state/ national healthcare policy for COVID-19, and the availability of resources (testing and protective equipment). In this narrative review, information on ECT practice experience from centers across the world was collated from the published literature and from the guidelines prescribed by professional societies. A search was made on the online platform (Google Scholar, Pubmed, Ebsco) using the keyword combinations, 'Electroconvulsive therapy', 'Covid pandemic', 'airway management', 'protective equipments', and 'ventilation'.

A few recommend baseline RT-PCR testing for all patients 1-2 days before the first ECT (Bryson and Aloysi, 2020; Flexman et al., 2020; Sienaert et al., 2020) . Most groups advised avoiding ECT in Covid-19 positive cases for the first two weeks unless it is urgent and life-saving due to the risk of infection spread (Flexman et al., 2020; Gil-Badenes et al., 2020; Lapid et al., 2020; Ramakrishnan et al., 2020) . Conversely, COVID-19 positive patients have received ECT successfully in tertiary care hospitals without the above restrictions , even during the symptomatic phase of COVID-19 infection (Braithwaite et al., 2020) . Furthermore, many added information regarding the possible risks of contracting COVID-19 disease to the informed consent (Burhan et al., 2020; Lapid et al., 2020) . During ECT, it is recommended to monitor the patients daily for fever and respiratory symptoms. Repeated swab testing is not advised routinely unless the patient develops symptoms. However, some have recommended weekly RT-PCR testing for all patients irrespective of the symptoms (Gil-Badenes et al., 2020; Sienaert et al., 2020) .",

To reduce aerosolization during oxygen administration, face masks/nasal cannula is to be placed beneath the surgical mask (Flexman et al., 2020; Schumann et al., Gil-Badenes et al., 2020; Thiruvenkatarajan et al., 2020a, b) . Apneic ventilation with BMV is a source of aerosolization (Tran et al., 2012) . To avoid BMV, some centers adopt a more extended period of preoxygenation and/or self-hyperventilation, or use head straps for holding the mask and avoiding BMV completely (Bellini et al., 2020; Flexman et al., 2020; Lapid et al., 2020; Sienaert et al., 2020; Gil-Badenes et al., 2020) ) and restrict BMV to cases with desaturation (Luccarelli et al., 2020) . Others recommend to continue using low tidal volume BMV along with preoxygenation, provided a high-quality mask seal is achieved (Bryson and Aloysi, 2020; Schumann et al., 2020; Tor et al., 2020a, b; Gil-Badenes et al., 2020.) . Alternatively, apneic oxygenation using nasal prongs or laryngeal mask airway has also been suggested (Flexman et al., 2020; Thiruvenkatarajan et al., 2020a, b) . High flow oxygen therapy using a nasal cannula is considered as an alternative to standard oxygen therapy. The risk of aerosolization remains similar in both techniques, and it may avoid the need for invasive airway management/ BMV (Thiruvenkatarajan et al., 2020a , b, Li et al., 2020 . Few centers prefer placing an endotracheal tube (ETT) for airway management (Braithwaite et al., 2020) . Though ETT and LMA can provide better oropharyngeal/airway seal, maintain closed-loop ventilation, prevent the need of BMV and allow the anesthesiologist to maintain a safe distance from the patient, higher incidence of cough during recovery and subsequent aerosolisation negates the benefits. There is also a concern about increased anesthesia time. For these reasons, routine use of ETT and LMA has been advised against by few experts (Limoncelli et al., 2020) . However, if an airway needs to be secured, LMA is preferred over an ETT as it is less invasive. Concerning the breathing circuit, a closed circuit is ideal for preventing environmental contamination, though the use of Mapleson-C and Jackson-Rees circuits have also been suggested (Intensive care medicine and Anaesthesia societies UK, 2020; Limoncelli et al., 2020) .",

ECT is stopped altogether in some cases, with a plan to start rescue ECTs if illness relapses. In general, brief-pulse ECT with bilateral (bifrontal or bitemporal) ECTs are preferred to right unilateral ECT to avoid an ineffective session of determining seizure threshold. The titration-based method is only used to determine the seizure threshold, but erring on the higher electrical stimulus. In cases with available details of the past history of ECT, we administer a suprathreshold electrical stimulus from the first session based on the seizure threshold of the previous ECT course. Seizure duration is monitored through a motor component to reduce ECT administration time. ",

ECT service was restricted to three days per week (April to August 2020). Since September 2020, we resumed our ECT services to six days a week as more patients started visiting the hospital with ease of transportation. From April till November 2020, we have administered 1083 sessions with an average of 7 sessions per day as against 1927 sessions during the period January to March 2020 with an average of 27 sessions per day ( Table 2 ). The turnover time between the patients increased from 10 min to 30 min. We have not observed any significant change in the complication rate (5/1083 vs. 12/1927). All patients who sustained post-ECT desaturation had a higher BMI and got settled by oxygen supplementation through a Hudson mask. They were then isolated and tested for COVID-19, but none of them turned out to be positive. As of November 2020, we have administered ECT to 5 COVID-19 positive patients with a total of 11 sessions without any complications in the red zone OT complex. The COVID-19 positive cases did not have any respiratory signs and symptoms. Glycopyrrolate was administered for two patients in-view of excess oral secretions. BMV and airway suctioning were avoided in all the patients. ECT was uneventful in all these patients. Till now, none of our ECT team members has developed any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, nor antibody tested positive.",
