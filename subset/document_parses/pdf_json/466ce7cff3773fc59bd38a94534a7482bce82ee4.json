That is, increasingly strict requirements are demanded to leave a digital footprint of each preparation and analysis step in derivation of a finding to support reproducibility and reuse of both data and tools. This is a welcome development, now extended by many journals into the realm of critical research reagents (A. Bandrowski 2014; A. E. Bandrowski and Martone 2016; Prager et al. 2018) . How do we facilitate it? And how do we make the recorded digital footprints most useful? Our notion, inspired by a large body of work in abstract argumentation frameworks, and analysis of biomedical publications (Tim Clark et al. 2014; Greenberg 2009 Greenberg , 2011 , is that the evidence for correctness of any finding can be represented as a directed acyclic support graph, an Evidence Graph. When combined with a graph of challenges to statements, or their evidence, this becomes a bipolar argument graph -or argumentation system (Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex 2009 .",

(Al Manir & Clark, in preparation; w3id .org/EVI#). EVI is based on the fundamental idea that scientific findings or claims are not facts, but assertions backed by some level of evidence, i.e., they are defeasible components of argumentation. Therefore, EVI focuses on the structure of evidence chains that support or challenge a result, and on providing access to the resources identified in those chains. Evidence in a scientific article is in essence, a record of the provenance of the finding, result, or claim asserted as likely to be true.",

Many more such cases could be cited, including the Wakefield paper in Lancert which claimed that MMR vaccination caused autism (Deer 2011 ; The Editors of The Lancet 2010; Wakefield et al. 1998 ). In these well-publicized cases, research that initially appeared to have groundbreaking promise, was shown to be invalid based on examination of the underlying data and methods. While the Obokata and Surgisphere retractions occurred relatively quickly, due no doubt to the egregiousness of the scientific misconduct involved, it is reasonable to believe that less obtrusive, or more well-concealed errors, malfeasance, or simple hyped-up claims with a poor (or no) basis in evidence, is much more prevalent.",

This framework successfully demonstrated interoperability across several NIH \"Data Commons\" environments, providing the identifier, authN/authZ, and metadata management elements of Grossman's \"data ecosystem\" concept (Grossman 2019) . We extended and re-engineered this framework over time to track and visualize computations and their evidence, to manage the computational objects (such as data and software) as well as their metadata, to analyze very large datasets with horizontal scale-out, to support neuroimaging workflows, and to make it generally more easy for scientists and computational analysts to use, by providing Binder and Notebook services (Jupyter et al. 2018; Kluyver et al. 2016) , and a Python client.",

The historian of science Steven Shapin, described the approach developed with the first scientific journals as \"virtual witnessing\" (Shapin 1984) , and this is still valid today. The typical scientific reader does not actually reproduce the experiment but is invited to review mentally every detail of how it was done to the extent that s/he becomes a \"virtual witness\" to an envisioned live demonstration. That is clearly how most people read scientific papers -except perhaps when they are citing them, in which case less care is often taken. Scientists are not really incentivized to replicate experiments; their discipline rewards novelty. The ultimate validation of any claim once it has been accepted as reasonable on its face comes with support from multiple distinct angles, by different investigators, and with re-use of the materials and methods upon which it is based. If the materials and methods are sufficiently transparent and thoroughly disclosed as to be reusable, and they cannot be made to work, or give bad results, that debunks the original experiments -precisely the way in which the promising-sounding STAP phenomenon was discredited (Haruko , before the elaborate formal effort of Riken to replicate the experiments.",
