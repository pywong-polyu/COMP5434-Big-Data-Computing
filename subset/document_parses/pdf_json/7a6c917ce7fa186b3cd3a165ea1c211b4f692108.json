Nevertheless, COPD is manageable if patients are aware of their susceptibility to health risks. While combustible cigarette smoking is the most critical risk factor for COPD exacerbations, the COPD National Action Plan [4] emphasizes identifying the range of individual and health system risk factors associated with poor COPD-related outcomes across different regions of the United States (U.S). States in the southern U.S. report some of the worst COPD outcomes [5] . For example, Alabama has the second-highest state prevalence of COPD in the entire U.S., with nearly 10% of the state's population (i.e., close to 400,000 Alabamians) likely to be living with COPD [6] . In 2020, chronic lower respiratory disease was the third leading cause of death in Alabama [7] . Approximately 53 out of every 100,000 Alabamians die from COPD each year [8] . Annually, the cost of treatment for COPD in Alabama is approximately $543 million [9] .",

Rather than using summated indices to assess risk within each of these domains, we used latent class modeling (LCM), which is a data analysis technique that collapses numerous discrete indicators into a set of parsimonious latent classes (i.e., risk categories) and estimates the probability that a respondent belongs to a mutually exclusive class based on their pattern of responses on a set of variables. LCM was ideal for this study due to the need for untangling complex relationships between health risk indicators. We estimated three sets of discrete latent class models with eight BRFSS indicators (i.e., asthma, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, stroke, depression, kidney disease) for the comorbidity domain, six BRFSS indicators (i.e., no health insurance, no primary healthcare provider, cost prevented medical care, no check-up in the past year, no flu shot in the past year, no pneumonia vaccine) for the limited healthcare access domain, and five BRFSS indicators (i.e., smoked at least 100 cigarettes over a lifetime, current smoker, current use of chewing tobacco, binge drinking, heavy drinking) for the substance use and abuse domain. Figure 1 lists all risk indicators that were evaluated under the \"BRFSS Indicators\" column. For each LCM, we estimated results for the entire sample of Alabamians with COPD and then separate LCMs for Black versus white Alabamians with COPD.",

The analysis enables researchers to identify mutually exclusive groups that adequately describe the dispersion of observations in the n-way contingency table of discrete indicators. In other words, the response pattern on a set of variables is the unit of analysis that classifies subgroups into mutually exclusive types of latent risk classes (e.g., high, intermediate, or low) [26, 27] . For example, a class 1 membership may indicate that most class 1 respondents show low levels of current smoking, heavy drinking, or binge drinking, and we may classify this membership as a \"low risk\" group for substance use and abuse. In contrast, a class 3 membership may detect that most respondents in class 3 report smoking, heavy drinking, or binge drinking; we may classify this membership as the \"high risk\" group for substance use and abuse. We may also find a class membership between 1 and 3, classified as an \"intermediate\" risk group. LCM uses an iterative approach in which models are estimated in succession and compared using model fit indices.",

Of the eight comorbidities considered in this study, the most significant proportion of multi-morbid patients with COPD reported asthma, arthritis, and symptoms of depression. This finding is consistent with national comorbidity estimates in the general COPD patient population [38] . While challenging, healthcare providers across the state of Alabama should work toward standardizing treatment approaches for highrisk Alabamians with COPD, with specific attention given to patients living with specific comorbidities (i.e., asthma, arthritis, and symptoms of depression). These interconnected chronic conditions may contribute to similar symptoms in patients with COPD [39] ; thus, Alabamians with COPD, especially those considered to be \"high risk,\" should be screened and treated for these particular co-occurring conditions that may compound the health complications associated with COPD.",

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an increasingly important contributor to COPD [40] , which is likely due to inflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms [41] . Consistent with the findings from this study in Alabama, a diagnosis of arthritis is associated with a higher prevalence of COPD across the U.S. population [42] . Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and COPD have an almost 50% greater risk of COPD-related hospitalization than the general population [43] . The mortality risk is also likely higher among patients with COPD who have rheumatoid arthritis versus those who do not [44, 45] . Therefore, healthcare providers should strongly consider assessing COPD and arthritis symptoms together for earlier detection. Dual diagnosis will enable providers to prescribe pulmonary rehabilitation and self-management training interventions that address how to treat both of these conditions simultaneously [42, 46] . Given the high prevalence of co-occurring COPD and arthritis in Alabama, future research should seek to understand the effects of arthritis on morbidity and mortality in Alabamians with COPD.",

COPD increases the risk of developing anxiety and depression, both of which can negatively affect disease prognosis, most notably by increasing the risk of exacerbations [47] . Alabamians with COPD should be screened and treated for anxiety and depression (if necessary), as patients with these mental health conditions typically show higher levels of shortness of breath than patients without mental disorders [48] . Although some evidence supports pharmacological treatments for anxiety and depression in patients with COPD, only small studies with modest effect sizes support such medications [47] . Primary care physicians should consider referring high-risk Alabamians with COPD with subclinical mental distress to hospital-or clinic-based pulmonary rehabilitation [3] and/or alternative mind-body exercise (i.e., Tai Chi, yoga) programs [49] . One metaanalysis showed that patients with severe symptoms of COPD who participated in selfmanagement interventions focused on mental health and symptom management showed more significant improvements in health status with fewer emergency room visits than those who participated in interventions that addressed symptom management alone [50] .",

Although over half of Alabamians with COPD at high risk for comorbidities were obese, the proportion of patients reporting diabetes and obesity within the intermediate risk class was higher than among patients classified as high risk. Other studies report that more than onethird of patients with COPD are obese [51, 52] . Interestingly, an \"obesity paradox\" in COPD [53] may exist, whereby obese patients with COPD may have lower exacerbation frequency [54] and reduced in-hospital mortality caused by exacerbations [55] than their non-obese counterparts. Our analysis demonstrated that obese white Alabamians with COPD were more likely to be at high risk for comorbidities than those who were not obese. This finding contradicted what was found in obese Black Alabamians with COPD who were much less likely to be at high risk for comorbidities. Thus, the impact of obesity on comorbidity risks for patients with COPD may differ based on race, with obese white patients experiencing more health-related challenges caused by unhealthy body weight. Future studies within Alabama should examine racial disparities in hyperglycemia (i.e., high blood sugar) and body mass index values to help understand how race potentially influences the obesity paradox among Alabamians with COPD.",

Almost two-thirds of Black Alabamians with COPD were at intermediate risk for being diagnosed with asthma, which was about six times higher than the proportion of white Alabamians with COPD who reported a diagnosis of asthma. Black adults with COPD or coexisting COPD and asthma use fewer medical services and account for lower medical costs than white adults, which may provide a possible explanation for the racial disparities in outcomes of patients diagnosed with both COPD and asthma [56] . Future research should examine how race influences asthma-COPD overlap (i.e., symptoms of asthma and COPD), including the frequency of dyspnea and exacerbations. Our study also showed that Black Alabamians with COPD, in addition to heart and kidney disease, were much more likely to be at high risk for comorbidities than their counterparts without these comorbidities.

Medicare's complicated coverage and reimbursement structure pose unique challenges for patients with COPD who might need access to primary and specialty (i.e., pulmonary rehabilitation, respiratory therapy) healthcare services. Gaffney et al.

In this study, white Alabamians with COPD who received their annual flu shot and pneumonia vaccine were at markedly low risk for limited healthcare access compared to white patients who did not receive these vaccines. However, low vaccination rates remain problematic for Alabamians living with COPD because they are particularly vulnerable to influenza, which can cause otherwise preventable breathing exacerbations [59] . The target Healthy People 2030 recommendation for flu vaccination is 70% for the general population [60] , which is a percentage more than 25% higher than the current flu vaccine rate of Alabamians with COPD [9] . Despite positive benefit-to-risk ratios for seasonal influenza vaccination in patients with COPD [59, 61] , the proportion of Alabamians with COPD who receive their flu vaccine is wholly inadequate. Future research should seek to understand the perceived benefits and barriers toward preventive vaccines among Alabamians living with COPD.

Interestingly, only 5% of Alabamians with COPD belonged to the high-risk class for substance use and abuse; most were at low risk for engaging in substance abuse. Over 80% of Alabamians with COPD were classified into the low-risk substance use class. Still, about one-third of these low-risk Alabamians identified as current smokers. Most U.S. adults with COPD smoke every day and binge drink or drink heavily at least once over the past 30 days [38] .

While the majority of Alabamians with COPD do not seem to be engaging in these types of high-risk substance use and abuse behaviors, it is worth noting that Blacks diagnosed with COPD are more likely to experience the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke due to biological, socioeconomic, and cultural factors [12, [66] [67] [68] .",

The BRFSS is based on telephone survey data that includes unvalidated self-reports affected by recall bias. Given the limited number and standardized content of BRFSS items, future research should consider incorporating other variables (e.g., interpersonal relationships, community/social ties) above and beyond the individual and health system indicators assessed in this study. Such analyses should consider county-level data from Alabama that enable more localized comparisons across the state. Alternatively, to place our preliminary findings in an appropriate context, future analyses should compare differences in health risk indicators between Alabamians diagnosed with COPD and those without COPD.",

In addition, although BRFSS is a telephone-based survey, one strength of this study is that it includes an extensive sample of respondents randomly drawn from Alabama rather than from convenience samples of patients with COPD. As a result of this, the generalizability of our results represents a positive characteristic of this population-level secondary data analysis.",

Disparities in health risk profiles should be addressed across the state to improve the health status of Alabamians with COPD. In particular, greater focus should be placed on racial/ethnic subgroups with limited healthcare access. As healthcare systems work to improve the care of COPD patients across Alabama, existing disparities must be quantified to assure the equitable implementation of risk mitigation interventions for all racial and ethnic groups. Data-based policies and interventions may reduce the impact of specific personal and health system access risk factors that disproportionately affect the health of Alabamians living with COPD.
