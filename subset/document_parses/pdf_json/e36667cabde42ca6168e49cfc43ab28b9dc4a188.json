Lappeenranta University of Technology has actively contributed to the spread of Industrial Mathematics in East African region over the past decade through development projects financed by the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In this article, we summarize these projects and present their achievements. The story of European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry (ECMI) and the accumulated experience over 25 years have been the encouragement and inspiration for our initiatives. They were focused on Applied Mathematics curriculum development in Partner countries, and on organization of ECMI-style practical workshops like modeling weeks. There is obvious demand to broaden the cooperation between Africa and the European applied mathematics community.",

In August 2014, I was presented a very unique opportunity, to participate as an instructor at the East African Modeling Week in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. I realized that, as an instructor, you have to pose a good challenge problem to the students but then also be able to guide the students to draw up their own solutions. I was able to achieve it all thanks to the training of instructors organized before the modeling week. \"I presented a problem of groundwater modeling with rain. The problem was a localization of a similar problem in [4] to a home situation of encroachment on wetlands, where in one particular wetland in Kampala, a highway has been constructed on one side and there is land filling for human settlement on the other side. On both sides canals have been constructed to reduce on the resulting floods especially in the wet seasons. Students were not given any clues on the solution. Several sessions of brainstorming and discussions ensued and it was very interesting that by the end of the week the students had a mathematical model for the problem as well as the solutions.
