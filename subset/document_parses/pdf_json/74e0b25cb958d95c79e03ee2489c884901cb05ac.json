The costs create an incentive for local politicians and their affiliated firms to temporarily restrict the flow of negative information about the companies. The result will be fewer stock price crashes for the affiliated firms during these event windows, followed by an increase in crashes after the event. Consistent with these predictions, we find that the affiliated firms experience a reduction (an increase) in negative stock return skewness before (after) the event. These effects are strongest in the three-month period directly preceding the event, among firms that are more politically connected, and when the province is dominated by faction politics and cronyism.

Prior research argues that politicians and governments like to avoid negative news about their activities (e.g., Peltzman [1976] , Watts and Zimmerman [1986] ). To the extent that certain events asymmetrically increase the cost of releasing bad news, local politicians will have a heightened incentive to temporarily restrict the flow of negative information about firms under their control or influence. Similarly, self-interested firms reliant on the support of local politicians will also respond to the incentives created by the political event. If these temporary incentives are sufficiently strong, the result will be a reduced flow of negative information in advance of the events, followed by an increase in the flow of negative information after the event as previously suppressed information is subsequently released. For publicly traded companies, the temporary suppression of negative information will generate a distinct shift in stock price crash behavior around the political event if the market is unable to fully unravel the suppression of bad news.",

We employ a stock price crash methodology specifically designed to capture the suppression and subsequent release of value-relevant negative information (e.g., Chen, Hong, and Stein [2001] , Jin and Myers [2006] ). We focus on Chinese listed firms because their information environment is expected to be sensitive to political incentives for opacity. In China, government and party officials exert significant influence on listed firms through direct ownership arrangements and/or indirect channels (e.g., bureaucracy, regulation, licensing requirements, and informal political and social networks); this influence creates a conduit by which listed firms are expected to align their behavior with the preferences of local politicians. We focus on meetings of the National Congress and provincial-level promotions as these two events temporarily increase the political costs of revealing bad news. From a career concerns perspective, local politicians incur a personal cost when firms under their control report poor performance, as adverse economic news limits their advancement within the party structure (e.g., Chen, Li, and Zhou [2005] , Li and Zhou [2005] ). More generally, authoritarian governments like China need to demonstrate strengths to stay in power (e.g., Tullock [1987] ). The revelation of bad news about Chinese firms and their political supervisors reveals weaknesses, disrupts the government's narrative, and impacts social harmony. In both cases, the revelation of bad news is very costly to both local politicians and their affiliated firms during these event windows, generating a heightened incentive to suppress negative information. Finally, China's institutional arrangements, such as weak regulatory enforcement, limited private enforcement opportunities, concentrated ownership structures, and relationship-based contracting, may be insufficient to support the necessary incentives for transparency during these periods.",

First, the conversion of state enterprises to joint stock companies and their subsequent listing on stock exchanges expose state-controlled firms to western governance mechanisms and market forces that demand transparency. Second, the Chinese government also set up the State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission to further decentralize control power from central and local governments to the listed firms. Qian [1996] and Fan, Wong, and Zhang [2013] argue that the Chinese government has established structural wedges between politicians and listed firms to credibly commit to not intervene in these firms' day-to-day operations. Third, suppression of negative information is inherently difficult. Successful suppression requires politicians to have control over an array of information dissemination and production mechanisms that prevent self-interested market participants and competing politicians from leaking negative information. Finally, the market could interpret silence during political periods as bad news; this unraveling would eliminate the expected political benefits of suppression. To the extent that these factors effectively mitigate the influence of local politicians' incentives for opacity, we should not observe Chinese listed firms responding to transitory pressures to suppress bad news around political events. More generally, we expect firms most (least) exposed to strong market (political) forces, such as firms with weak political connections, nonstate-owned firms, or firms operating in market-oriented provinces or in provinces without powerful local politicians, to be less sensitive to transitory political incentives.",

Mirroring the theoretical predictions of Chen, Hong, and Stein [2001] , this intertemporal pattern is consistent with the initial suppression, and subsequent release, of adverse news in response to the heightened incentives of the local politicians and affiliated firms. These results are robust to alternative empirical specifications and various empirical measures of stock price crash behavior and information flow (including stock price synchronicity). Our evidence suggests that the incentives and ability of the politicians to suppress bad news outweigh the countervailing factors that promote transparency from decentralization of control of listed firms and the economic development of the provinces in China. The China market's inability to unravel the deferral of bad news is consistent with the evidence in Giglio and Shue [2014] indicating that a more developed U.S. market also underreacts to information contained in the absence of news. In additional analyses, we document the strongest reduction in stock price crashes in the three months preceding the political events, consistent with the heightened incentives to suppress bad news being most acute in the last few months leading up to the event. Further highlighting the role of political costs in this setting, our evidence shows that the incentive to suppress negative information varies based upon the level of political connections of the firms, and whether the local politicians belong to a political faction or are offspring of old CCP revolutionaries.",

Specifically, suppression effects are found in both state-owned and non-state-owned firms and are unaffected by firm and provincial-level proxies for capital market-based pressures. Also contrary to expectations, we find that Hong Kong-listed Chinese firms, arguably better regulated and subject to stronger market forces and more sophisticated investors, also experience a reduction in stock price crashes prior to both events. On the one hand, the robustness of the suppression effect across ownership types, capital market proxies, and markets where the firms are listed raises puzzles on how the government can orchestrate such extensive information control; on the other hand, this robustness highlights the power that Chinese politicians continue to wield over both the state and nonstate sectors despite China's state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms and the regulatory and market pressures found in both domestic and Hong Kong markets.",

Despite the absence of intervention from the government through direct ownership control, non-state firms may voluntarily engage in bad news suppression in order to build the needed connections and trust with politicians that is enjoyed by their counterparts in the state sector. Although the pressures and channels to increase transparency greatly increase in more developed provinces and the Hong Kong market, there are also counterbalancing political forces to heighten the suppression incentives in these settings. Negative news about firms operating in more developed regions and/or specially chosen for a Hong Kong listing is likely to generate greater embarrassment to the politicians; this effect arises because these particular firms are visible and under greater scrutiny by a public expecting superior performance from them. Finally, notwithstanding our recognition of the difficulty in suppressing bad news among listed firms in China, we have documented evidence consistent with the conjecture that political incentives can influence newspaper reporting around these political events. More specifically, we document that the number of newspaper articles published about the listed firms in both official and financial newspapers temporarily decreases in advance of these political events, which is suggestive of the government's ability in controlling one channel of the listed firms' information environment.",

Despite the government's efforts to decentralize state-controlled firms and develop the domestic stock market, Chinese listed firms are found to be sensitive to acute political incentives for opacity. Relative to the extant literature, our paper has several contributions. First, we examine a dimension of opacity-the suppression of negative information-that has not been explored in prior research yet maps strongly into the prevailing preferences of politicians. Second, we utilize an empirical methodology that captures both the suppression and the subsequent release of negative information; the documentation of this theoretically predicted intertemporal pattern is novel to the accounting literature and eliminates many of the alternative interpretations of the pre-event period patterns alone. Third, through the joint use of intertemporal and cross-sectional proxies for heightened political costs, we minimize misspecification concerns found in a time-series or cross-sectional analyses alone, thus strengthening the link between transitory political costs, information suppression incentives, and observed stock price behavior. Finally, by examining changes in a stock price-based measure of negative information flow-the negative skewness of excess returns (i.e., stock price crash statistic)-we capture information effects beyond those contained in accounting, audit choice, or disclosure data alone. By construction, this stock price measure captures the net flow of all valuerelevant, adverse information through all available information channels; as such, the measure reflects news from the full set of information production and dissemination mechanisms that the local politician must control to effectively suppress negative information. From a research design perspective, this approach allows us to determine whether aggregate changes in accounting, reporting, disclosure, and dissemination practices around these political events have a net impact on the overall information environment of listed firms (as captured by observable stock price behavior).",

Although we are unable to document the exact mechanisms through which the suppression of negative information occurs, our tests have the ability to refute our information suppression hypotheses. Our results provide a useful starting point for future research seeking to identify the exact channels by which politicians and the listed firms temporarily suppress the net flow of negative information around politically sensitive events, such as a reduction in firm-level disclosures, issuing biased financial reports, self-censorship by the media, direct censorship by the politician, and the adoption of disclosure (e.g., bundling) and/or trading strategies to camouflage negative information, and how these channels of suppression actually work across ownership types and political connection levels of the firms, provinces where the firms operate, and the markets where the firms are listed. Given the increased opportunity for investors to purchase shares in both Chinese firms and other politically affiliated firms around the world, understanding the impact of short-term political incentives on the underlying financial reporting and information environment of these listed companies is a first-order concern for market participants.",

Greater transparency benefits both the listed firm and the economy by improving the monitoring capabilities of both the state and outside investors, reducing information gathering costs, improving the efficiency of capital allocation and investment decisions, increasing foreign investment, lowering the firm's and country's cost of capital and, ultimately, increasing economic growth. However, because the incentives of local politicians and their affiliated firms are frequently not aligned with value or wealth maximization, transparency, especially with respect to the revelation of bad news, is costly. Transparency about state-controlled entities highlights inefficiencies, political agendas, and economic disparities that exist within these firms (e.g., Shleifer and Vishny [1997] , Rajan and Zingales [2003] ). 1 Similarly, transparency about both state-controlled and non-state-owned firms under the local politician's supervision can bring unwanted scrutiny, especially with respect to policy failures, favoritism, and corruption, and limit the ability of politicians and executives to consume their private benefits of control by exposing weak governance practices, expropriation, and rent-seeking behavior. The revelation of poor operating performance by affiliated firms also imposes personal costs upon local politicians and the firm's executives in the form of diminished reputational capital and damaged career prospects. Because of these costs, affiliated, self-interested firms are expected to adopt information practices that minimize the expected political costs associated with reporting adverse news. More importantly, incentives to suppress negative information are expected to be temporarily heightened in advance of political events that incrementally increase the costs of revelation.",

In general, Chinese listed firms are associated with weak financial reporting practices (see Piotroski and Wong [2012] for a summary). The reporting outcomes are shaped by institutional arrangements (e.g., concentrated ownership, relationship-based contracting, and weak investor protections) that minimize both the demand for and supply of highquality external reports. Despite these institutional arrangements, there are several reasons why Chinese listed firms may not respond to transitory incentives to suppress negative information. First, the decentralization of state-owned companies, through government reforms and the stock exchange listing process, creates a structural wedge between politicians and local state-controlled firms (e.g., Qian [1996] , Fan, Wong, and Zhang [2013] ). If effective, this operational autonomy, and resultant reliance on external (nonstate) financing and use of professional management, can potentially insulate state-controlled firms from the day-to-day influence of local politicians. Second, the maturation of China's capital markets and emergence of non-state-owned enterprises have increased the relative importance of both market and reputational incentives; given that these benefits rely upon a credible commitment for transparency, they may act as a countervailing force against transitory political incentives. Robust capital markets are also associated with additional channels by which negative information could be leaked by self-interested market participants or competing politicians. Third, sophisticated investors may unravel silence in advance of political events as bad news; this unraveling would eliminate the neither social welfare nor their operating cash flows; instead, governments use their control to achieve personal political objectives and to compensate their supporters (e.g., Shleifer and Vishny [1993] , LaPorta et al. [2002] , Rajan and Zingales [2003] ). The incentive to maximize these private benefits results in weak corporate governance and enormous inefficiencies among state firms (e.g., Shleifer and Vishny [1997] , OECD [2005] , Wurgler [2000] ). Moreover, for publicly listed firms, serious agency conflicts arise as the state (controlling shareholder) attempts to expropriate the cash flows and capital of the minority shareholders. expected benefits of temporarily suppressing negative information. Finally, the suppression of negative news is inherently difficult, requiring politicians to directly or indirectly control a broad array of information channels and self-interested individuals.",

Unexpected negative information also reveals weaknesses and results in a \"loss of face\" for both local politicians and the central government. In addition, Chinese culture values social conformity and the maintenance of relationships, with government policy during the latter half of our sample period explicitly stressing the importance of maintaining social harmony. The existence of these cultural norms and policies creates significant incentives for politicians and executives to not disrupt the government's narrative around visible political events.

For example, commentators argue that China was slow to release information about the SARS virus in 2003 and bird flu virus in 2005. More recently, local politicians in the city of Shijiazhuang suppressed a company report from the Sanlu Group identifying the widespread distribution of contaminated milk powder in the marketplace in advance of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, held in Beijing. This report was withheld for more than a month, until the completion of the Olympic Games, to avoid creating a negative influence in society. and other politicized channels (e.g., bureaucracy, licenses, capital raising activity). As a result, the personal incentives of central and local politicians are expected to influence the decisions of affiliated firms. Finally, with the limited development of China's legal system and investor protections and the absence of credible property rights protection, firms seek the protection and resultant benefits that accrue to maintaining strong relations with local politicians; this relationship-based environment creates neither a demand for nor supply of timely information. More importantly, these relationships can become a conduit for mapping the politicians' preferences into firm-level decisions, especially for non-state-owned firms. 3 These political forces and their effects on the cost of releasing bad news are expected to vary by firm and provincial characteristics. This variation would enable us to test whether such political forces are related to the occurrence and degree of bad news suppression in advance of political events. We have a number of ways to capture this variation. First, the activities of politically connected firms and executives are likely to be more scrutinized than firms and executives without political connections. We expect that these relationships, and the political benefits and repercussions it can bring, potentially raise the relative cost of releasing bad news for affected firms, politicians, and executives. Second, we expect that politicians promoted on the basis of faction politics or family relations (rather than meritocracy), and the central government officials sponsoring them, have stronger incentives to suppress any bad news leading up to the promotion announcement in order to bring legitimacy to their advancement. Additionally, these same, powerful politicians are more likely to be able to exercise influence over listed firms and information dissemination channels than politicians lacking this political clout. Third, state-controlled firms, which ultimately report to the local politician, typically suffer from numerous inefficiencies and agency conflicts; as a result, politicians have both the ability and motive to suppress negative information about these companies. 4 However, local politicians can also influence the reporting and disclosure incentives of non-state-owned firms through conferring or denying 3 Additionally, Chinese politicians have the ability to influence the firm's broader information environment. Traditional media channels are controlled by local government and party organizations through direct ownership arrangements, licensing activities, and financial support; internet and social media activities are highly regulated and actively monitored, and both channels are subject to censorship (Shirk [2010] , Stockmann [2013] ). Similarly, government ownership arrangements, regulation, and social networks allow local politicians to exert influence over China's domestic brokerage firms, thus providing politicians a conduit to influence domestic analyst and trading activity. 4 For example, Jian and Wong [2010] and Jiang, Lee, and Yue [2010] document the widespread use of related party transactions and intercompany loans to facilitate the tunneling of resources in state-controlled firms. Allen, Qian, and Qian [2005] show that China's formal sector (i.e., state-controlled entities) underperforms informal sectors of the economy (i.e., family and entrepreneurial firms). Fan, Wong, and Zhang [2007] document that benefits to non-state-owned entities such as access to capital and other investment opportunities (e.g., Chen and Yuan [2004] ). Thus, these nonstate firms may even have just as strong an incentive to suppress bad news as state firms in order to establish close ties with politicians. It remains an empirical question whether the political incentives to temporarily suppress bad news are sufficiently strong to influence both state and nonstate firms or are limited to state-controlled firms. Finally, we expect that firms operating in provinces with greater capital market development, issued B-shares that are owned by foreign investors, and listed in the Hong Kong market are more sheltered from political pressures to defer the release of bad news during the two political events.",

In their seminal paper, Watts and Zimmerman [1978] argue that accounting choices are influenced by the expected political costs associated with given financial reporting outcomes. These political costs can range from heightened tax burdens (e.g., windfall profits tax) to the outright expropriation of the firms' productive assets, and also include a host of indirect taxes such as heightened regulation or the threat of greater government intervention into the firm's business activities. Consistent with these arguments, existing research using international (i.e., non-U.S.) data finds that firms tend to remain opaque in the presence of strong political economy forces, as measured by level of state ownership of assets, greater risk of expropriation, and the presence of political connections (e.g., Bushman, Piotroski, and Smith [2004] , Bushman and Piotroski [2006] , Gul [2006] , Leuz and Oberholzer-Gee [2006] , Wang, Wong, and Xia [2008] , Chaney, Faccio, and Parsley [2011] , Durnev and Guriev [2011] ). Moreover, these financial reporting incentives shift as the firm becomes more or less exposed to these political incentives over time, such as following privatization events (e.g., Guedhami and Pittman [2006] , Wang, Wong, and Xia [2008] , Guedhami, Pittman, and Saffar [2009] ).",

Given those theoretical relations, we use the observed pattern of stock price behavior to infer the suppression of negative information around events that create an ex ante incentive for such behavior. Specifically, a decline in negative skewness during an event window is interpreted as a temporary reduction in the flow of negative information about these firms. A subsequent increase in large negative stock price movements immediately following the event window (i.e., greater negative skewness) reflects the release of the previously suppressed negative information. 8",

Releasing negative information during congress years inherently contradicts an objective of these meetings and returns in the estimation to control for the impact of any trading frictions and nonsynchronous trading effects. We individually estimate equation (1) annually for each firm in order to accommodate potential shifts in the variance of returns before and after our political events (i.e., Ncskew is based on an independent, firm-level, annual estimation of equation (1) for each firm-year observation). 7 Bris, Goetzmann, and Zhu [2007] , Hutton, Marcus, and Tehranian [2009] , and Kothari, Shu, and Wysocki [2009] find empirical support for this interpretation of crash statistics among broad cross-sections of U.S. and global firms. 8 Due to the strong positive correlations that exist between Ncskew and alternative measures of negative skewness used in the literature, we only tabulate and discuss results using Ncskew. Our conclusions using Ncskew are robust to the use of a measure of daily \"down-to-up-volatility\" introduced in Chen, Hong, and Stein [2001] .

Additionally, these meetings draw considerable domestic and international attention. To the extent that investor, public, and political scrutiny are elevated around a National Congress, all firms would have an incentive to delay the release of bad news during this event window.

These promotion events are visible and anticipated by economic agents in the province. Because the party secretary and governor are the top two positions in a province, these promotions create a tournament-like contest for personal advancement within the provincial political and communist party structure; thus, all politicized agents in the province have an incentive to window-dress economic performance before these events. Moreover, the central government can exert pressure on local firms to improve the credentials of the identified provincial officials before their promotion. This top-down pressure also prevents local political rivals from releasing bad news to undermine the credentials of the soon-to-be-elevated provincial politician. Because of the planned nature of political transitions in China, politicians and affected firms have a well-defined window (usually 12 to 18 months) over which these incentives arise (Shih, Adolph, and Liu [2012] ). Prior research shows that political promotions in China are influenced by the recent performance of the region (Chen, Li, and Zhou [2005] , Li and Zhou [2005] ); as such, it is costly for local politicians and managers to release negative financial information about local state-controlled firms in advance of the appointment. Additionally, non-state-owned firms also have heightened incentives in advance of these promotion events given the importance of maintaining strong relationships with local politicians, as such relations grant the firm preferential access to capital and investment opportunities and reduced bureaucracy. Given the duration of the evaluation process, we define our event window as the year preceding and containing the promotion event (years -1 to 0). Firms that operate in the same province as the promoted politician are considered to be those affected by these promotion events. Data on political promotion events are hand-collected by searching information published in the \"Chinese Personnel Database\" and \"China VIPs\" from China Information Bank and supplemented by Google web searches.",

If temporary incentives to suppress negative information are created, we expect a negative coefficient on the indicator variable Political i,t . The indictor variable Post-Political i,t equals one if the firm-year falls in the year following the political event, zero otherwise. To the extent that the firm subsequently releases negative information following the political event, we expect a positive coefficient on the indicator variable Post-Political i,t . This research design allows the indicator variables to compare stock return behavior across firmyears affected by the event against firm-years unaffected by the event (e.g., National Congress years versus non-National Congress years; firm-years associated with provincial promotion versus firm-years without provincial promotion). 9 The remaining independent variables are drawn from prior research examining the determinants of stock return skewness. We include these variables to capture firm characteristics that could potentially induce a stock return crash independent of the historical suppression of financial information (e.g., Chen, Hong, and Stein [2001] , Harvey and Siddique [2000] ). Firm size, measured as the log of the firm's market value of equity at the end of year t (LogSize i,t ), is expected to be negatively related to negative skewness, as larger firms are less likely to experience dramatic price declines due to their diverse set of operations and their rich information environment. The firm's beta (Beta i,t ) and the standard deviation of daily residual returns (Sigma i,t ) are included to capture the systematic and idiosyncratic risk characteristics of the firm during year t. The negative skewness of residual returns is expected to be decreasing in Beta i,t and Sigma i,t because the distribution of payoffs to risky projects is positively skewed. 10 9 Appendix B provides a timeline-based representation of this research design. For National Congress meetings, our research design is akin to a regulatory event study, with all firms receiving the treatment in the same year. For political promotions, our research design is very similar to a panel methodology where Political equals one (zero) for those firms domiciled in specific provinces receiving (not receiving) the promotion treatment in any given year. 10 Although the daily residual returns used to calculate Ncskew are mean-adjusted for the firm's exposure to the market risk premium (i.e., beta-adjusted), higher moments of the excess return distribution can still be associated with beta and other risk proxies. Harvey and Siddique [2000] , for example, show that return skewness has incremental explanatory power for firm-level returns over beta.",

The firm's contemporaneous annual stock return controls for current firm performance, allowing for the examination of the short-term flow of information conditional upon the firm's average performance. Contemporaneous share turnover is included to capture liquidity effects and investor interest. To the extent that stocks with heightened trading volume are more prone to crashes (i.e., torpedoed), contemporaneous share turnover will be positively related to negative skewness (e.g., Chen, Hong, and Stein [2001] ). The inclusion of lagged share turnover and lagged annual returns allows us to control for momentum and behavioral factors (i.e., heightened investor sentiment, irrational exuberance, and bubbles) that can produce price reversals in the subsequent year (e.g., Chen, Hong, and Stein [2001] ). We also include year and provincial fixed effects in all promotion estimations to control for unobservable characteristics. 11 All explanatory variables are defined in appendix A. 12 Table 1 presents descriptive evidence on the distribution of our firmyear observations across time and provinces. The number of observations increases dramatically over our 19-year sample period, corresponding to the underlying growth in China's capital markets (panel A). The composition of our sample is tilted toward state-owned entities, with nearly 67.7% of our total firm-year observations drawn from local, state-controlled firms. However, that relative percentage declines over our sample period, as economic policies promoting greater market development and encouraging entrepreneurial activities lead to an increase in non-state-owned firms listing onto China's exchanges in the latter half of our sample period.",

The sample consists of two types of listed firms, those that are ultimately controlled by the local government (i.e., state-controlled firms), and those that are not controlled by local government entities (i.e., non-state-owned firms), with sufficient financial accounting and stock price data available in the China Security Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database to implement our primary empirical tests. A political promotion event relates to the transfer, reassignment, or promotion of either the provincial party secretary or the provincial governor to a position of more political power. Table 1 also documents the distribution of our provincial-level political promotion events across time (panel A) and provinces (panel B). Over our sample time period, there exist 96 political promotion events across 28 provinces. For purposes of our empirical tests, these promotion events are not strictly clustered in time or specific provinces; all but three of our provinces experience at least one promotion event, and there is at least one event per year over the entire sample period. Table 2 presents descriptive statistics on our sample of Chinese listed firms. These firms tend to be large entities, with an average market capitalization of 2.19 billion RMB. Despite their large size, the firms display considerable variation in terms of economic performance (Return i,t ), sales growth (Growth i,t ), share liquidity, and investor interest (Turnover i,t ) and risk (Beta i,t and Sigma i,t ). The descriptive statistics highlight substantial variation in our crash measure, Ncskew i,t , across firm-years, and corroborate prior findings that state-owned entities have weaker information environments than nonstate-owned firms in China (i.e., are more crash prone (on average) and have more synchronous prices).",

This decline is followed by a temporary increase in negative skewness in the year following the promotion, consistent with the subsequent release of previously suppressed information. This subsequent increase in Ncskew i,t alleviates concerns that the positive association between Ncskew i,t and Political i,t is an artifact of reverse causality, namely, provinces with strong economic conditions and stock price performance generate more political promotions. Economically, the observed reduction equates to a one-tenth of a standard deviation reduction in negative stock return skewness in advance of political promotions. This decline is less severe than the reduction observed around National Congress years, which could be an artifact of the intensity of the National Congress period, the localized aspect of political promotions, or the long-window nature of the political promotion process. 14 Together, the time-series pattern of negative stock return skewness (relative to nontreatment firm-years) is consistent with the systematic suppression and subsequent release of negative information around these two political events and limitations in the ability of market participants to unravel silence as bad news (e.g., Giglio and Shue [2013] ). 15 More importantly, this observed stock price behavior is being observed in two settings where (1) local politicians have an acute incentive to exert influence over firms under their direct and indirect control to minimize their personal cost of reporting bad news during these sensitive periods and (2) executives of local firms have a self-interested incentive to suppress negative information to protect valuable connections and curry favor from affected politicians.

In our analysis, we find that negative skewness increases by approximately 0.055 and 0.121 following National Congress meetings and political promotions, respectively. Although the Chen, Hong, and Stein [2001] results are based upon parameters derived in U.S. markets, this comparison suggests that the documented effects are economically meaningful. More generally, postevent volatility has the potential to impose significant material costs upon the firm and the market at large; because both political risk and stock price volatility are typically priced by market participants, an increase in the perceived riskiness of the firm and/or market can (1) increase the cost of capital for listed firms and (2) potentially drive sophisticated investors out of the market. Finally, from a broad perspective, opacity is a friction in market economies. In our study, negative skewness is an empirical proxy to capture changes in the firm's information and the firm's tendencies to withhold value-relevant negative information in response to specific political incentives. In that vein, our evidence speaks to a form of opacity that is prevalent among Chinese listed firms; such informational frictions can have wide-ranging repercussion in markets, including greater information asymmetry, higher transaction costs, more expensive capital, inhibiting arbitrage activities, and less efficient contracting arrangements. 15 Inferences obtained in table 4 are robust to the inclusion of indicator variables for both National Congress meetings and political promotion event periods in the same estimation (see online appendix, table 4A).",

The lack of an observed relation could be because CEO backgrounds do not adequately capture variation in the strength of political connections in China. For example, individuals appointed to run state companies are selected by the government; as a result, these CEOs are likely connected in spite of their previous work experience. Similarly, the strength of a successful entrepreneur's political connection is more likely to be related to the success of his company and less about his/her previous work experience.",

Estimations using these two empirical proxies reveal that politically connected firms experience a greater reduction in Ncskew i,t in advance of our political events, especially National Congress meetings; however, we are unable to document an incremental increase in crash frequency after the event for politically connected firms. The preevent variation, and tabulated cumulative suppression effects, provide evidence consistent with firms garnering economic benefits from the state responding to incrementally stronger incentives to temporarily suppress negative information in advance of these meetings; the postevent behavior suggests that either that these tests are also misspecified or that connected firms are being affected by an omitted force preventing or obscuring the post-National Congress stock price crash reversal.

Second, princelings and nonprincelings engage in similar levels of suppression in advance of our two political events. However, firms affiliated with princelings experience larger stock price crashes following these events (as noted by the positive coefficient on the term Post-Political i,t \u00d7 Attribute i,t in both estimations). 18 One possible reason for the less consistent results for the National Congress meetings with the Shanghai-faction-affiliated politicians and the two political events for the princelings is the lack of power in the tests. The politicians' factional affiliations may have a stronger effect on the release of bad news around their promotions than National Congress meetings. Also, not all princelings in our sample exert the same level of power as the Shanghaifaction-affiliated politicians, which could contribute to the weaker results for the two events involving princelings. Further, the cumulative suppression effects around political promotions for firms operating in provinces controlled by princelings or members of the Shanghai faction are significantly stronger than provinces not controlled by these powerful politicians. This variation is consistent with the characteristics of local politicians, and resultant incentives, shaping the information environment of listed firms around these political events.",

Additionally, if the mechanism(s) through which suppression occurs differs by firm type, one might observe differences across ownership. For example, if direct control increases the ability of a politician to influence the information dissemination activities of listed firms, suppression should be stronger among statecontrolled companies. 19 Yet, if the decentralization of SOE's has been effective, both state-controlled and non-state-owned firms could exhibit very similar behavior around these events.

However, comparing across estimations, we find that the promotion period effect is significantly more pronounced among state-controlled firms, consistent with the politician bearing greater costs for the release of negative news about state firms around these highly visible national events. For both sets of firms, this decline is followed by the predicted increase in negative stock return skewness in the year immediately following the National Congress. Focusing on impending provincial-level promotion events, the incentives appear to affect both types of firms equally. Specifically, the intertemporal pattern of significantly lower Ncskew i,t before the promotion, followed by significantly higher Ncskew i,t after the event, is statistically and economically similar across the two types of firms. Taken together, the results suggest that state ownership heightens incentives to suppress negative news prior to the National Congress meetings, but has no incremental effect on either the subsequent releases of the news after the meeting or bad news suppression and subsequent releases around political promotion. This is consistent with the conjecture that local politicians can, through indirect intervention, exert equally strong pressure on nonstate firms to control the release of bad news, especially around their promotions, and/or nonstate firms have an equally strong incentive as the state firms to engage in strategic news releases because the former need to build political connections with the politicians.",

If Hong Kong institutions create credible reporting incentives, H-share listings should exert a positive influence on the disclosure practices of listed Chinese firms. However, a Hong Kong listing may fail to produce bonding-related benefits for Chinese firms. For example, Hung, Wong, and Zhang [2012] find that Chinese state-owned firms' overseas listing decisions are primarily determined by politicians' agendas, with the performance of these overseas listed firms deteriorating following the foreign listing. Absent bonding benefits, a Hong Kong listing would have no effect on reporting incentives around political events. Finally, Chinese firms listed on foreign exchanges are the most prominent and visible Chinese companies. The release of bad news by these firms during one of our political event windows is expected to impose a large, visible cost on the local politician and central government; as such, these Hong Kong listed firms could face strong countervailing incentives to temporarily suppress the release of bad news during politically sensitive event periods. Table 8 presents coefficients from estimations using two separate samples of firms. The first set of estimations mirror the analysis in table 4 on a small sample of non-central government-owned Chinese firms with H-shares listed in Hong Kong. These estimations document the same pattern of suppression found among mainland firms around these two political events. Second, using our pooled sample of mainland (A-share) listed Chinese firms, we estimate an empirical model that includes an indicator variable for the presence of a Hong Kong cross-listing. These estimations reveal that the suppression of bad news around our two political events is not attenuated by the presence of a Hong Kong listing. Instead, contrary to our expectations, the suppression effect is actually incrementally stronger for visible, Hong Kong listed firms domiciled in a province experiencing a political promotion. The heightened level of suppression among these Hong Kong listed firms is consistent with the overseas listings decision of Chinese firms being politically motivated; any bad news of these firms during politically sensitive events will bring greater embarrassment to their affiliated politicians. 20 This evidence casts further doubt on the ability of a Hong Kong listing to fully resolve governance weaknesses among China's listed entities. 20 We reestimate our basic tests on a subsample containing only Hong Kong listed firms and the largest non-Hong Kong listed Chinese firms (defined as the top quartile of our sample). Estimations using this reduced sample yield Hong Kong listing results similar to those reported in table 8 (see online appendix, table 8A). The result that size is not causing the heightened incentive to suppress bad news further suggests that political visibility is a possible reason.

To the extent that the capital market and reputational benefits of transparency rely upon a credible commitment to providing information in a timely manner, we would expect firms most exposed to market forces to be less sensitive to transitory political incentives. Stronger capital market settings are also associated with more conduits by which negative information can be gathered, used, and disseminated, thus increasing the difficulty for firms and local politicians to suppress negative information. However, politicians in decentralized, economically welldeveloped provinces could be more sensitive to adverse market news about firms under their supervision because the public expects these firms to perform better than those in less-developed provinces. Then a market orientation may produce a countervailing incentive, which both negates the aforementioned reputation and commitment pressures and intensifies the politicians' efforts to control the firm's information environment.",

The first proxy, Equity market development, is measured as the total market capitalization of all listed firms in the province in year t, scaled by provincial gross domestic product. The indicator variable Market Development equals one if the province ranks in the top half of the distribution in year t, zero otherwise. The second proxy, B-shares, is an indicator variable equal to one if the firm also issued a class of tradable B-shares. Given that Bshares are targeted for foreign investors, the existence of B-share securities increases the firm's exposure to sophisticated, transparency-demanding investors compared to firms only trading in the A-share market (i.e., only domestic investors). The existence of B-share prices also provides additional information signals to A-share market participants. Contrary to these predictions, we find that neither Market Development nor B-shares has an impact on Ncskew patterns around our two political events, both before or after conditioning upon the ownership of the company (see online appendix, table E). The lack of variation across these settings suggests that either our empirical proxies failed to capture meaningful variation in market-based incentives or that market forces are not sufficiently developed in China to create the necessary offsetting incentives during these politically charged periods. It could also be that the increase in market forces that promote transparency in decentralized, well-developed provinces are counterbalanced by the heighten incentives for politicians to suppress bad news when the public has a higher expectation of its firms to report good performance.",

That said, from a research design perspective, the use of the negative skewness methodology outlined and used in prior research requires a tradeoff between theory and data-a shift in negative skewness is the theoretical prediction, but skewness is required to be measured over long windows (e.g., annually).

We test changes in the likelihood of large negative price movements by creating indicator variables meant to capture the firm-month's proximity to the political event. As such, Pre-Political i,t is an indicator variable equal to one if the firm-month precedes a specific political event within the indicated time range; zero otherwise. Analogously, Post-Political i,t is an indicator variable equal to one if the firm-month follows the political event over the indicated time frame, zero otherwise. The remaining independent variables correspond to the relevant determinants of negative stock return skewness included in equation (2). This analysis is performed using 162,582 available firm-month observations during our sample period. Table 9 presents select coefficients (and t-statistics using standard errors clustered by province) from various estimations of equation (5). In the first set of estimations, Pre-Political i,t and Post-Political i,t relate to the months preceding and following the month that the National Congress of the CCP was held. In the second set of estimations, Pre-Political i,t and Post-Political i,t relate to the months surrounding a provincial-level political promotion event. These estimations reveal that the likelihood of large negative price movements is significantly lower in the three-month period preceding and the month including the political event. Moreover, we observe that the reduced likelihood of negative news around the National Congress persists for a few months after the actual meeting. Because key policy decisions and highlevel political appointments are announced and scrutinized in the months immediately following a National Congress, the continued suppression of negative news during this politically sensitive time period is intuitive and reflects prevailing incentives in this context. In contrast, the reduction in negative news events in advance of a political promotion is concentrated in the months directly preceding the event (with the effect strongest in the three months immediately preceding the event), with the likelihood of large negative return shocks rebounding to baseline levels after the event. Once the promotion is publicly announced and implemented, the incentive to suppress in that province abates. Morck, Yeung, and Yu [2000] and Gul, Kim, and Qiu [2010] document that stock price movements are highly synchronous in China; this strong comovement is attributed to a limited flow of firm-specific information into prices in this marketplace. 21 Building on this interpretation of stock return synchronicity, we examine whether the overall flow of firm-specific information into prices is affected by our two political events.

First, Chen, Hong, and Stein [2001] utilize a second crash statistic, Duvol i,t that captures the \"down-to-up volatility\" of the individual stock. Duvol i,t is measured as the log of the ratio of the standard deviation of residual returns on \"down\" days to the log of standard deviation of residual returns on \"up\" days, where down and up days are defined relative to the firm's mean daily residual return realization over the measurement period. Firms with higher level of Duvol i,t are interpreted as being more crash prone. Replicating our principle analyses (i.e., table 4) using Duvol i,t in lieu of Ncskew i,t yields similar results (see online appendix, table 4C). 25 Second, in table 9, we utilize a logistic regression specification to document changes in the relative likelihood of large negative stock price movements around our political events. This analysis, relying on granular monthly return data, quarterly political event windows, and firm-month observations, yields suppression inferences consistent with our annual analysis using Ncskew. 24 Robustness tests using monthly newspaper data document a significant reduction in the flow of newspaper articles in the six months preceding the National Congress, followed by a significant increase in articles in the three months following the event. Tests using monthly data around the political promotions fail to document significant changes in the flow of newspaper articles over these shorter windows (see online appendix, table 11A). 25 For our sample of firm-years, the Spearman correlation between Ncskew and Duvol is 0.94. This high correlation is consistent with these two measures capturing the same underlying construct, namely, the crash prone tendencies of the underlying stock. Third, we measure the relative frequency that the firm experiences material negative weekly stock returns, and examine whether this frequency changes around our political events. Specifically, we define Fraction i,t as the percentage of calendar weeks that the firm experiences a large, negative stock price drop during the fiscal year. A large negative stock price drop is defined as a negative weekly excess return more than 1.96 standard deviations below the sample mean or a price decline greater than minus 20%. In these estimations, firms with a higher level of Fraction i,t are interpreted as being more crash prone. Pooled estimations using both estimates of Fraction i,t as the dependent variable confirm the basic inferences obtained from table 4 (see online appendix, table 4D).",

The presence of the political event raises the cost of reporting bad news; however, the event could also alter the incentive to release good news. In general, politicians and affiliated firms are expected to have been disclosing good news in a timely manner; such timely disclosure is inherently in line with their incentives. If politicians always report good news in a timely fashion, one would expect no incremental effect on good news disclosures during event periods, absent the production of new information by the politician. In contrast, politicians and affiliated firms can actively choose to withhold negative information as it arises (i.e., reduce the timeliness of reporting bad news over the event period). This is the asymmetric effect we predict, and our research setting and design are geared for identifying this negative information effect in security prices.",

Specifically, the frequency with which firms experience large positive stock returns (i.e., stock price jump) will therefore decrease in the year prior to the political events and increase during the political events. Such behavior is reasonable if the expected benefits of releasing good news are higher in the political event period than the preceding period. Moreover, given the planned and highly anticipated nature of the two political events in our study, affected agents will certainly have an opportunity to strategically time the release of good news through such a deferral mechanism. To test this good news deferral conjecture, we measure the percentage of weeks in a given year that the firm experiences a large price increase. A positive weekly excess return more than 1.96 standard deviations above the sample mean or a price increase greater than 20% is considered a large stock price increase. The empirical results do not support this good news deferral conjecture (see online appendix, tables A, B, and C). We are neither able to document a significantly lower frequency of price jumps in the one-year period preceding the start of our respective political events, nor do we find any heightened incidence of stock price jumps during the two political event windows. 27 There is also no evidence that Ncskew i,t is significantly higher in this preevent period, as would occur if good news were withheld. In addition, the failure to document an increase in stock price jump frequency during the political event windows casts doubt on the explanation that an increase in good news production and/or dissemination is responsible for the empirical stock price crash results documented in this paper.",

For our sample, we observe that ROA and investment rates are not temporarily elevated in advance of the political events; instead, ROA remains constant and investment rates frequently decline in the year before the political events. These preevent trends document that affected firms were not experiencing heightened economic performance in advance of the event, consistent with the good news analyses discussed in the preceding section. Additionally, we document a temporary, postevent decline in ROA after National Congress meetings that is consistent with accounting information (which typically lags prices) reflecting bad news that was likely suppressed in advance of the event and/or the unraveling of propping activities around the political event.",

We find that increases in negative skewness following the political event are significantly negatively correlated with changes in negative skewness before the event; this autocorrelation in Ncskew realizations around National Congress meetings and provincial promotions is -0.460 and -0.443, respectively. More importantly, these negative correlations are both significantly larger in magnitude than the baseline level of negative correlation observed outside these political windows (nonpolitical correlation = -0.376). 28 This evidence is consistent with an observed jump in negative skewness after the political event being related to the decline in negative skewness preceding the event, thus reinforcing the informationbased interpretation of our main results.",

Our evidence supports this proposition. First, we document a significant and theoretically predicted shift in security price behavior around these political events, consistent with politicians and affiliated firms temporarily suppressing negative news. Second, we document that this pattern is incrementally stronger in settings where the political incentive to restrict such information is greater. Finally, we supplement this evidence with a direct examination of one aspect of the firm's information environment-the publication of newspaper articles-and find that the supply of firm-specific information temporarily declines during these event periods.",

We view the paper as serving an important first step in documenting how the short-term incentives of politicians and politically connected managers influence the information environment of emerging market firms. We encourage future research to exploit similar political settings to contextually examining the channels and mechanisms used by politicians and affiliated firms to temporarily suppress the flow of negative information into stock prices. Moreover, the results in the paper raise numerous questions about price formation in these settings. How does the market actually price politically driven information risk? Is this risk premium applied at the market level, or does the premium vary over time and/or based upon the political characteristics of the firm? How does the market interpret silence during these politicized periods, and what is the expected impact on realized returns over these windows? Do investors actively search for negative information during these political periods, and, if they do, what mechanisms are preventing the impounding of this information into prices before the political event?",
