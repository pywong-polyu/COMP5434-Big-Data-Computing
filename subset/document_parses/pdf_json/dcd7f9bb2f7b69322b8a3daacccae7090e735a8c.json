The pandemic declaration led to increasingly strict and widespread stay-at-home orders, which contributed to population level concerns about the risk of not only infection and loss of life, but the potential irrecoverable loss of livelihood, as nonessential businesses were shut down and citizens deprived of income, while facing continued expenses. Persisting beyond a full year, the COVID-19 pandemic produced a global population-level stressor that continues to influence how people live.",

Examples include World War II from 1939-1945 [1] , the Dutch Famine from 1944-1955 [2] , and the Desert Storm War in 1996 [3] . These examples represent a range of stressors, whether they be physical vs. psychological, direct vs. indirect, or short vs. long-term. At the extremes of stress, a case series of women studied prior to being executed noted that almost all became amenorrheic [4] . In an observational study of Lebanese women exposed to wartime bombing from April 11-27, 1996 , 35% experienced menstrual aberrations for 3 months, as compared to an unexposed group that reported abnormalities in 2.6% [5] . Abnormal menstrual patterns are also commonly reported among desert-dwelling hunter-gatherer women who face difficult living conditions [6] . Yet mortal stresses of this magnitude are not required to induce menstrual aberrations; chronic job-related stress can be a contributor [7, 8] . Further, in a study of Japanese college students, 15.8% reported a correlation between their school examinations and irregular menses [9] . The range of stressors that can influence one's likelihood of menstrual irregularity is wide, suggesting that other mediating factors may play a role.",

Anovulatory cycles were defined according to the Natural Cycles app's proprietary algorithm. The algorithm identifies ovulation retrospectively based on the first day of menstruation and basal body temperatures, which may be supplemented by positive urinary LH tests. Basal body temperatures are recorded each morning using a thermometer sensitive to the hundredth place, and with measures excluded if the user reports any illness, alcohol intake, or changes in sleep that might influence basal temperatures. Users of Natural Cycles record basal temperatures for approximately 70% of the days; approximately 25% use LH tests. To reduce the risk of misidentifying ovulations, the algorithm reports ovulation by rising basal body temperature only if the average temperature from three consecutive calendar days is greater than the woman's follicular phase average and her baseline average across all data entries, as well as consistent with her luteal phase average [11] . If no temperature rise is observed and the data quality and quantity is deemed sufficient, the cycle is flagged as anovulatory. Of note, users with stable measurements (e.g., small day-to-day variations in the same cycle phase), require fewer data points for the Natural Cycles algorithm to draw conclusions about changes in the basal body temperature. Cycles with low data quality (e.g., high day-today temperature variability) or data that is insufficient to detect or exclude an increase in the basal body temperature are excluded by the analysis. While missing data may affect the app's ability to predict the exact day of ovulation, they are not expected to affect its determination of whether ovulation has occurred. Based on criteria from the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), we defined abnormal cycle length as lasting less than 24 days or more than 38 days, and prolonged menstruation length as lasting greater than 8 days [12, 13] .",

We incorporated this measure to examine a stress-related pathway for menstrual abnormalities. The researchers asked users to rate two Likert-type items: (1) \"Thinking about your stress level before the COVID-19 pandemic started, how stressed were you then?\" (2) \"How stressful is the COVID-19 pandemic to you now?\" The Likert items were anchored from \"Not at all stressed\" (1) to \"Extremely stressed\" (5) . We then calculated a COVID-related stress change score by subtracting the user's report of stress before COVID from their stress rating during COVID. For ease of interpretation, we categorized perceived changes in stress using five categories: \"much less (1),\" \"less (2), \"unchanged (3),\" \"more (4),\" and \"much more (5) .\" In addition, we used sociodemographic data and reproductive histories provided by users at the time of app registration and updated during use of the app as covariates in our analysis. These covariates included: age, country of registration, education (from less than a high school degree to graduate degree), relationship status (e.g., in a relationship, engaged or married, it's complicated, and single), history of pregnancy, and whether they have any children.",

At the individual user level, approximately 7.7% and 19.5% of users recorded more anovulatory cycles and abnormal cycle lengths following the pandemic, respectively; 3.4% recorded prolonged menses. For some women, a new finding of amenorrhea, menorrhagia, or the inability to predict ovulation can be distressing and may lead to healthcare visits, laboratory workups, and imaging studies that may be unable to definitively determine an etiology. Contrary to expectation however, a larger proportion of mobile app users recorded fewer abnormalities during the pandemic than prior (9.6% and 20.1% recorded fewer anovulatory cycles and abnormal cycle lengths, respectively). Even when examining the cycle characteristics of women self-reporting more (32.0%) and markedly more (13.6%) stress following the pandemic, we did not observe any independent association of stress with cycle abnormalities. Rather than among women reporting high stress, we noted more abnormal cycles among women greater than the age of 45 years during the pandemic, which may suggest the stress-related sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis during the perimenopausal state [14] .",

Only 56.9% of users responding to the pandemic-related stress item, with the consequent possibility of selection bias; however, this sub-analysis still captured data from more than 10,000 users. For this population, general stress provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic and its preoccupations may not have been sufficient to elicit an adrenal and adaptive neuroendocrine response to acute stress or chronic stress. We note as well that our chosen time points may not have been sufficiently long enough to observe stress-related physiologic effects which might not have been observed during the early months of the pandemic. Alternatively, our surface-level measurement of self-reported stress may have been insensitive to true distress or the behavioral determinants of stress-induced hypothalamic dysfunction [23] ; our 2-item assessment of pandemic-related stress was likely biased towards inflated stress-reporting. While an ideal measure of change in stress would have repeated the question at two time points, we anticipated that user responses to the above two questions would still reflect perceived stress, as related to the pandemic. Yet even in studies where validated measures, such as the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, are used, the relationship between the psychosocial status of women and aberrations in their menstrual cycles cannot always be demonstrated [24] . Future studies could collect serial stress assessments to evaluate the effects of chronic stress, as well as serum cortisol levels or diagnoses of COVID-19.",

Natural Cycles' recording of daily menstrual and basal body temperature diaries thus provided us with robust data for exploring female reproductive health and physiology in the setting of widespread socioenvironmental change-the COVID-19 pandemic.

While some women experienced abnormalities during the pandemic, this proportion was smaller than that observed prior to the pandemic. As most app users in this study were well-educated women over the age of 30 years, and from high-income countries, their experience of the COVID-19 pandemic may differ in ways that limit the generalizability of these findings.",
