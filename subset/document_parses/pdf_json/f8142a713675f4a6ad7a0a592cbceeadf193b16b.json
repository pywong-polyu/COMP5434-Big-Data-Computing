The disease is characterized by fever, often above 40\u00b0C, apathy, anorexia, abdominal pain or tenderness, vomiting and diarrhoea. Dogs may develop bronchopneumonia, conjunctivitis, photophobia and a transient corneal opacity,`blue eye', which may occur after clinical recovery as result of anterior uveitis and corneal oedema (Appel, 1987a; Green, 1990) . ICH is now uncommon in vaccinated populations. However, it is observed more frequently in unvaccinated populations, especially in puppies less than 1 year old. Clinical signs of uncomplicated CAV-1 infection usually lasts 5\u00b17 days, with rapid recovery; however, they may last longer in dogs with concurrent infections, such as canine distemper virus (CDV 2 ) or, rarely, in animals that develop chronic active hepatitis (Green, 1990; Kobayashi et al., 1993 3 ). Although ICH occurs sporadically, the disease has been well controlled since the 1950s when attenuated viral vaccines became available (Appel, 1987a) . Serological surveys conducted in various parts of the world prior to the widespread use of vaccines indicated that the seroprevalence of CAV-1 antibodies ranged from 30 to 60% in the dogs tested (Rubarth, 1947; Brunner et al., 1951; Cabasso, 1953; Sasaki et al., 1956) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 416, "end": 430, "text": "(Appel, 1987a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 431, "end": 443, "text": "Green, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 796, "end": 802, "text": "(CDV 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 866, "end": 879, "text": "(Green, 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 880, "end": 904, "text": "Kobayashi et al., 1993 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1057, "text": "(Appel, 1987a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1270, "text": "(Rubarth, 1947;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1292, "text": "Brunner et al., 1951;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1307, "text": "Cabasso, 1953;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1328, "text": "Sasaki et al., 1956)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Canine coronavirus (CCV) infection is the causative agent of a generally mild, usually self-limiting enteric illness in dogs characterized by sudden onset of vomiting and malodorous diarrhoea.

On the other hand, CCV infections are common in dogs, but most are mild, or asymptomatic, except in puppies or adult dogs suffering from stress or other infections (Appel et al., 1979; Appel, 1987b; Hoskins, 1998) . The outbreak described in the present report provides evidence that CAV-1 is still circulating in the canine population and that serious health problems may result where CCV is endemic, management is poor and systematic vaccination is not carried out. The investigated kennels, an animal shelter, was very poorly managed with respect to record keeping and sanitation; moreover, vaccinations had not been methodically carried out. The above factors very likely contributed to the severity of the outbreak of CAV-1 in the kennels. Another unusual \u00aending revealed in this study was the presence of CCV in the same kennels, often in the puppies that were infected with CAV-1. CCV infection in dogs is usually self-limited and infected animals usually recover after a brief period of illness. Nevertheless, puppies with secondary bacterial infections, parasites or other viral infections may suffer from severe, even fatal, disease (Evermann et al., 1980; Appel, 1987b; Buonavoglia et al., 1993) . Dual infections by both CCV and CPV-2 have been reported previously (Appel et al., 1979; Yasoshima et al., 1983; Martin and Zeidner, 1992) , and it has been shown that CCV enhances the severity of a sequential CPV-2 infection. Recently, a severe CCV infection was reported in three puppies that recovered from a CPV-2b infection (Pratelli et al., 1999b) .
