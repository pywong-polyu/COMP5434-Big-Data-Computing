Two already described polymorphisms are of particular significance. Ada polymorphism in cattle leucocytes is based on an autosomal four-allele system with ten phenotypes (Ansay & Hanset, 1972b) . These four alleles are expressed in our cell cutlures: the BEK-1, MDBK and Bu cell lines are of the B phenotype, the EBTr cell line is of the CD phenotype and the primary cell culture is of the AC phenotype. Allelic variation of the slow moving isozyme of Pgm (Pgm-3) has been described in cattle (Ansay et al., 1971 ). It is a two allele system with the B allele prevailing (95 %) in Belgian breeds. Four out of the five cell cultures are also of the B phenotype, the BEK-I cell line being of the AB phenotype. On the other hand, extensive studies of Np in Belgian cattle have disclosed the existence of quantitative and qualitative polymorphisms in red blood cells (Ansay & Hanset, 1972c; Ansay, 1975) while the zymograms obtained with nucleated cells of the same animals were indistinguishable. In this case Np electrophoretic pattern clearly distinguishes the Bu cell line which shows a very distinctive slow migration, most probably species-specific. Unfortunately we were unable to extent our study to cover a great number of buffalo. Eventually, however, this new phenotype could be a useful marker of the Bison bison species (Stormont et al., 1977) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 342, "end": 365, "text": "(Ansay & Hanset, 1972b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 665, "end": 684, "text": "(Ansay et al., 1971", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1058, "text": "(Ansay & Hanset, 1972c;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1071, "text": "Ansay, 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1524, "text": "(Stormont et al., 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Registry of animal cell lines", "authors": [{"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Anonymous", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1972, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Soluble glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) polymorphism in cattle", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["&amp; R"], "last": "Ansay", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Hanset", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1972, "venue": "Anim.
