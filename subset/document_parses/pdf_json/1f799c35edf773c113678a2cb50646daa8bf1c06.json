            "text": "In animal gonads, transposable elements are actively repressed to preserve genome integrity through the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. In mice, piR-NAs are abundantly expressed in male germ cells, and form effector complexes with three distinct PI-WIs. The depletion of individual Piwi genes causes male-specific sterility with no discernible phenotype in female mice. Unlike mice, most other mammals have four PIWI genes, some of which are expressed in the ovary. Here, purification of PIWI complexes from oocytes of the golden hamster revealed that the size of the PIWIL1-associated piRNAs changed during oocyte maturation. In contrast, PIWIL3, an ovary-specific PIWI in most mammals, associates with short piRNAs only in metaphase II oocytes, which coincides with intense phosphorylation of the protein. An improved high-quality genome assembly and annotation revealed that PIWIL1-and PIWIL3associated piRNAs appear to share the 5 -ends of common piRNA precursors and are mostly derived from unannotated sequences with a diminished contribution from TE-derived sequences, most of which correspond to endogenous retroviruses. Our findings show the complex and dynamic nature of biogenesis of piRNAs in hamster oocytes, and together with the new genome sequence generated, serve as the foundation for developing useful models to study the piRNA pathway in mammalian oocytes.",

To avoid such detrimental effects, many animals have a conserved adaptive immune system known as the piRNA pathway in gonads (4, 5) . piRNAs form effector complexes with PIWI proteins, a germline-specific class of Argonaute proteins, to guide recognition through complementary base-pairing, leading to silencing their target transposable elements (TEs) mainly in two ways: post-transcriptional silencing by PIWImediated cleavage of target transcripts in the cytoplasm and transcriptional silencing by PIWI-mediated chromatin modifications on target loci. Mutations in genes involved in the pathway can lead to sterility.",

            "text": "Although the mechanisms for generating piRNAs appear to largely differ among animals, the defined characteristics of piRNAs include a predominant length of 26-32 nucleotides (nt), a strong bias for uracil (U) at the 5ends (1U-bias), 2 -O-methylation of the 3 -ends, and clustering of reads to distinct genomic locations (4, 5) . The characterization of the piRNA populations in Drosophila and mouse has led to two models for the biogenesis mechanisms: the ping-pong cycle (6, 7) and phased (8, 9) , which are intimately connected. Long single-stranded precursors, often >10 kb in size, are derived from discrete genomic loci that are now referred to as piRNA clusters or piRNA genes (6, (10) (11) (12) (13) . Majority of piRNAs are derived from intergenic clusters. Intergenic piRNA clusters are often located in the heterochromatic regions and comprise various types of TEs that tend to be young and potentially active, suggesting that intergenic piRNA clusters provide the host with acquired and heritable memory systems to repress TEs (6, 14) . Some piRNAs also arise from 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) of the protein-coding genes (1516). The function of the genic piRNAs is not well understood, but some genic piRNAs show significant complementarity to protein-coding genes (15, 17) . piRNA precursors are cleaved by either endonuclease Zucchini/MitoPLD or by the Slicer activity of PIWIs with pre-existing piRNAs to produce 5 monophosphorylated piRNA intermediates that are loaded onto PIWI proteins (6) (7) (8) (9) (18) (19) (20) . PIWI-piRNA complexes then initiate piRNA production that is formed by an amplification loop termed the ping-pong cycle in which reciprocal cleavage of TE and cluster transcripts by PIWI proteins generates new piRNA 5 -ends and amplifies piRNA populations while destroying TE mRNAs in the cytoplasm. The ping-pong cycle produces two classes of piRNAs overlapped by precisely 10 nt at their 5 -ends: one class shows a strong preference for U at their 5 -ends (1U) and the second class shows a preference for adenine at nucleotide 10 (10A). The pingpong cycle is then accompanied by the phased production of piRNAs downstream of the cleavage site, which further creates a sequence diversity of piRNAs. The 3ends of piRNAs are determined either by direct cleavage of Zucchini/MitoPLD (mouse Zucchini homolog) or PI-WIs or by trimming piRNA intermediates by resecting enzymes (Nibbler in Drosophila, Trimmer in silkworm, and PNLDC1 in mouse) (21) (22) (23) . piRNA biogenesis is then concluded with 2 -O-methylation of the 3 -ends by HENMT1 methylase, which has been hypothesized to stabilize mature piRNAs (24) (25) (26) . The extent of 3 -end cleaving/trimming and consequently piRNA length is determined by the footprint of the PIWI protein, possibly explaining the different size profiles of piRNAs associated with distinct PIWI proteins. Structural studies have shown that the 5 -and 3 -ends of the guide small RNAs, including piRNAs, are recognized by the MID-PIWI and PAZ domains of Argonaute/PIWI proteins, respectively (27) (28) (29) .",

Similar to Drosophila, mice express three PIWI proteins, MIWI (PIWIL1), MILI (PI-WIL2) and MIWI2 (PIWIL4) in the testis, with varying spatiotemporal expression patterns during spermatogenesis. The non-redundant role of Piwi genes in the mouse testis is demonstrated by the fact that depletion of individual Piwi genes causes male-specific sterility owing to severe defects in sperm formation (30) (31) (32) . Each PIWI protein associates with distinct piRNA populations; fetal prepachytene piR-NAs and pachytene piRNAs. Prepachytene piRNAs are formed from TE-and other repeat-derived sequences. In contrast, pachytene piRNAs have a higher proportion of unannotated sequences with the diminished contribution of TE sequences, though they still function in TE silencing by guiding MILI and MIWI to cleave TE transcripts (3334). A specific transcriptional factor, A-MYB, binds the promoter regions of pachytene piRNA clusters as well as core piRNA biogenesis factors, including MIWI, and initiates their transcription (35) . Some pachytene piRNA clusters are divergently transcribed from bidirectional A-Myb-binding promoters (35) .",

Thus, these findings led to the assumption that the piRNA pathway does not play a role in mammalian oogenesis. Unlike mice, many other mammals possess four distinct PIWI genes (PIWIL1-4), suggesting that piRNAmediated silencing may differ between mice and mammals with four PIWI genes (36, 37) . However, except for mice, little is known about mammalian piRNA pathways, particularly their roles in ovaries. Although recent studies have reported the presence of piRNA-like molecules in mammalian female germ cells, including humans (38) (39) (40) (41) , it is not yet known whether they play a role in the ovary because of the difficulty of technical and/or ethical application of genetic analysis. Although mice and rats belong to the Muridae family of rodents, both of which lack Piwil3, the golden Syrian hamster (golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus) belongs to the Cricetidae family and has four PIWI genes. Golden hamsters have been used as an experimental rodent model for studying human diseases, particularly for cancer development and many different infectious diseases including COVID-19, because they display many features that resemble the physiological and pharmacological responses of humans (42, 43) . In addition, methods for manipulating gene expression, including the CRISPR/Cas9 system, have been recently employed in golden hamsters (44, 45) . Herein, we analyzed PIWI-associated piRNAs in oocytes and early embryos of golden hamsters, in the hope of applying genetic analysis to the piRNA pathway in the ovary. Our analyses revealed that the size of PIWIL1-associated piRNAs changes during oocyte maturation and that PIWIL3 binds short piRNAs only at the metaphase II (MII) stage of the oocyte, which coincides with phosphorylation of the protein. With an improved high-quality genome assembly and annotation of golden hamster, we showed that PIWIL1-and PIWIL3-associated piRNAs appear to share their 5 -ends. Their contents are similar to those observed with pachytene piRNAs in the mouse testis, but their targets in oocytes are mostly endogenous retroviruses. We further identified ovarian piRNA clusters, and motif search for the transcription start site regions of the piRNA clusters revealed no distinct binding motifs in their upstream regions, although A-Mybbinding motifs were enriched in the upstream regions of the testis piRNA clusters. Our study provides a basis for understanding the roles of the piRNA pathway in mammalian oocytes.",

We generated error-corrected reads using the FALCON assembler, which aligned PacBio raw reads to each other, obtained the consensus sequence of aligned reads using multiple alignments, and then output the consensus sequences as error-corrected reads. To fill unsettled gaps, we aligned error-corrected reads to the gaps using the minimap2 program (53) and manually inspected the results to determine whether the gaps were spanned by more than one error-corrected read (Supplementary Table S2 ).

The sequences were aligned with MAFFT ver. 7.427 (61) followed by manual curation, and a refined consensus sequence was constructed to be used for the next round of blastn search. This process was repeated for three rounds at maximum until the consensus sequence reached the 5 and 3 termini. We finally constructed 177 consensus sequences at the subfamily level and classified them based on the sequence structure and a comparison with known elements using CENSOR (62) and RepeatMasker ver. 4.1.0. We finally constructed a custom repeat library by adding 177 novel consensus sequences to the original rodent repeat library. RepeatMasker analysis was conducted for genome annotation using the cross-match engine with the sensitive mode (-s).

The estimated expression levels of Piwil1 and Piwil2 were relatively high in the testis (TPM = 24.24 and TPM = 14.07, respectively). Piwil1 was also expressed in the ovary (TPM = 4.63), while Piwil2 is not detected in the whole ovary and appeared to be only weakly expressed in the oocyte. Piwil4 appeared to be expressed only in the testis, consistent with previous transcriptome analysis in human oocytes (40) . Interestingly, Piwil3 was highly expressed in the oocyte (TPM = 14.60). In sharp contrast, the expression of Piwil3 could not be detected in the testis. These results are consistent with previous analyses of bovine and human PIWIL3 (38, 40) . To analyze the expression levels of known PIWI-piRNA pathway factors other than PIWI genes, we also calculated the TPM values of the predicted homologous genes using RNA-seq data (Supplementary Figure S1A) . Most of the known PIWI-piRNA pathway factor homologs, including Mov10l1, Mael, MVH (mouse Vasa homolog), Mito-PLD, Gtsf1, Henmt1 and Tudor domain families (4), were expressed in both testes and oocytes, suggesting that both testes and oocytes of hamsters have similar biogenesis pathways to produce piRNAs.",

Open reading frames (ORFs) of sequenced Piwil1 and Piwil2 cDNAs correspond well with the respective annotated gene products deposited in the Broad Institute database (MesAur1.0, Broad Institute data) (Supplementary Figure S1B) . However, to our surprise, during the cloning of the Piwil3 cDNA, we found that the large extension of the amino-terminal portion of the ORF contains 14 repeats of nucleotide sequences encoding the amino acid sequences QLQSPGAGPPRSGA ( Figure 1B) . To further confirm the expression of PIWIs in the ovary at the protein level, we produced specific monoclonal antibodies against PIWIL3 (Supplementary Figure  S1C) . We also found that a monoclonal antibody that recognizes marmoset PIWIL1 (37) cross-reacts with hamster PIWIL1 specifically among hamster PIWI proteins (Supplementary Figure S1C ). Thus, we focused our analysis on PIWIL1 and PIWIL3. Immunostaining with the antibodies produced showed that both PIWIL1 and PIWIL3 were expressed in the cytoplasm of growing oocytes in the ovary ( Figure 1C ). Western blotting with anti-PIWIL1 antibody showed a discrete band at 90 kDa in the ovary, metaphase II (MII) oocytes, and 2-cell embryos ( Figure 1D ). Western blotting with anti-PIWIL3 antibody revealed a discrete band at 130 kDa in the ovary and 2-cell embryos, which is consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the protein with the large amino-terminal extension ( Figure 1B and D). Intriguingly, the size of the protein largely shifted by approximately 40 kDa in MII oocytes ( Figure 1D ).",

Treatment of MII oocyte lysates with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP), an enzyme known to dephosphorylate proteins (76) , caused a discrete band to migrate to the estimated molecular weight of 130 kDa, demonstrating that PI-WIL3 is heavily phosphorylated in MII oocytes ( Figure 1E ). These results show that PIWIL1 and PIWIL3 are expressed in growing oocytes in the ovary as well as in early embryos and that PIWIL3 is modified with phosphorylation specifically at the MII stage of oocytes. Since the mouse genome lacks Piwil3 and thus the characterization of PIWIL3 protein has been delayed, our findings indicate that Piwil3 may have specific functions in female gonads.",

Intriguingly, PIWIL1 was associated with two populations of small RNAs: one with 29-30 nt and the other with 22-23 nt in MII oocytes. We then immunopurified PIWIL1-associated complexes from whole ovaries 2B). The resistance of PIWIL1-associated piRNAs in MII oocytes to periodate oxidation (NaIO4) and \u2424-elimination reactions show that they are modified at the 3 terminal nucleotide with a 2 -O-methyl marker ( Supplementary Figure S2A) . We also isolated PIWIL1-associated small RNAs from whole testes and found that small RNAs (29-30 nt) were loaded onto PIWIL1 in the testis ( Supplementary Figure S2B) . These results show that piRNAs loaded onto PI-WIL1 change their sizes during oocyte maturation, from the size equivalent to that observed in the testis to a mixture of long and short populations, and short piRNAs (22-23 nt) . To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that the size of piRNAs loaded onto a distinct PIWI protein changes during germline development.",

This is also consistent with human PIWIL3-associated piRNAs (40) . We failed to detect small RNAs associated with PIWIL3 in whole ovaries and 2-cell embryos ( Figure 2C ). With the caveat that this could be be- cause of technical reasons for immunoprecipitation with the antibodies and/or the buffer conditions used, our findings suggest that PIWIL3 may bind piRNAs with 19 nt exclusively in MII oocytes but be freed from piRNAs as 'empty' PIWIL3 at the early stages of oocyte maturation and in early embryos. PIWIL3 is heavily phosphorylated only in MII oocytes, raising the possibility that phosphorylation of the protein may be required for the association with a class of short piRNAs. To test this, we performed immunoprecipitation with an anti-PIWIL3 antibody using MII oocyte lysate that had been treated with CIP and examined whether the CIP treatment affected the association of piRNAs with PIWIL3. Indeed, PIWIL3 treated with CIP was free from piRNAs ( Figure 2D ). This shows that phosphorylation of the protein is required for PIWIL3 probably either to get loaded with piRNAs or hold them or both.",

            "text": "Although the draft genome of the golden hamster has been sequenced (the MesAur1.0 genome), we soon came to realize that we needed much more accurate genome sequence data to further characterize these PIWI-associated piRNAs on the genome mainly because the MesAur1.0 genome sequence contains a large number of gaps (N) (17.58% of the genome; 420 Mb of the 2.4 Gb) and remains fragmented. Because TEs and other repeats in the genome are the main targets of piRNAs in many animals, the lack of accurate sequences of TEs and other repeats is a serious problem when mapping piRNAs on the genome. Accurate detection of TEs requires both full collection/classification of TE consensus sequences and high-quality genome assembly. Thus, we re-sequenced the golden hamster genome. Details of the hamster genome assembly are shown in the Methods section. The final genome assembly is summarized in Table 1 . The nucleotide difference between the DNA Zoo MesAur1.0 HiC assembly and our assembly was 0.140%. We assessed the completeness of the genome assemblies using the BUSCO tool (77) and found that our golden hamster genome assembly included 3,991 complete genes (97.2%) and 37 fragmented genes among 4,104 singlecopy genes. Our new golden hamster genome allowed us to resolve several issues that had remained ambiguous. For example, although putative ancestral karyotypes of rodents in the Muridae and Cricetidae families have been partly reconstructed by traditional chromosome painting (78), we compared our nearly complete genome with the mouse (M. musculus) and rat (R. norvegicus) reference genomes (Methods) and identified conserved synteny blocks between the golden hamster, mouse, and rat genomes ( Figure 3A ). We inferred ancestral karyotypes by integrating synteny blocks shared between two or three species according to maximum parsimony, to minimize the amount of chromosomal rearrangement (Methods) and obtained a high-resolution ancestral karyotype of Muridae using the golden hamster genome as the outgroup as well as a precise ancestral Cricetidae karyotype ( Figure 3B ). Although our ancestral Cricetidae and Muridae karyotypes were consistent with most previous inference (78), we resolved some problems: for example, it was unclear whether mouse chromosomes 3 and 4 possessed synteny blocks from a common ancestral karyotype, and our analysis demonstrated the existence of a proto-chromosome in the ancestral Cricetidae karyotype (brown blocks in Figure 3B ). We also confirmed previous speculation that mouse chromosomes 5 and 16 obtained blocks from a common Muridae proto-chromosome (light orange in Figure 3B ), and that chromosomes 10, 15, and 17 obtained blocks from a common Cricetidae protochromosome (maroon blocks in Figure 3B ). Finally, we identified two groups of mouse chromosomes (6, 8) and (8, 13) having large blocks from common Muridae protochromosomes.",

RepeatMasker analysis using our custom repeat library (RepeatMasker rodent library with newly identified 177 consensus sequences) revealed that SINEs, LINEs, LTR retrotransposons, and DNA transposons occupy 9.2%, 16.9%, 12.1% and 1.3% of the hamster genome, respectively. The contents of TEs are equivalent to those found in mice and rats, but the fractions of SINE and LINE are, respectively, higher and slightly lower in the hamster than those observed in mice and rats ( Table 2 ). The contents of the MesAur1.0 genome (MesAur1.0 HiC) were similarly analyzed. In contrast to our assembly, a much lower proportion of young TEs were detected even using our custom repeat library (Supplementary Figure S4A , Supplementary  Table S4 ). This is mostly because of the high frequency of gaps (Ns) in the MesAur1.0 HiC assembly (Table 1) , which resulted in apparently less similarity between TEs and their consensus sequences.",

Hamster-specific subfamilies of B1 SINE were recently active, and 36 000 copies of young fulllength B1s are present in the assembly. We identified three groups of the LINE-1 (L1) family, two of which were recently highly active (L1-4 MAu and L1-5 MAu), and the genome harbors at least 1000 young full-length copies (Figure 4B) . The most active LTR retrotransposons belong to the ERV2/ERVK superfamily, including IAP (for ERV classification, see (79, 80) ). We identified 20 families of ERV2 that contain an internal portion between LTRs, and 11 of them possess a clear reverse transcriptase domain. There are over 13 000 LTR sequences and 1600 internal portions of the recently active elements in the genome. Among them, we found three recently expanded families: IAP1E MAu, ERV2-5 MAu and ERV2-7 MAu, which accounted for 29.9%, 14.7% and 26.8% of the very young (<2.0 K2P divergence) LTR retrotransposons, respectively ( Figure 4C ). It is likely that not only IAP but also other ERV2/ERVK elements are currently active in the hamster genome. Together, these results show that our effort to re-sequence the golden hamster genome significantly improved annotations, especially for recently active TEs, which are potential piRNA targets.",

For PIWIL1associated piRNAs, we also sequenced piRNA samples immunopurified with an anti-PIWIL1 antibody from testes. Replicates were highly correlated with each other (R 2 > 0.9) (data not shown); therefore, we merged the reads. First, we performed a length distribution analysis of the obtained reads ( Figure 5A -E). We observed peak signals at the size range of 29-30 nt in the testes and ovaries, 29 nt and 23 nt in MII oocytes, and 23 nt in 2-cell embryos of PIWIL1associated piRNAs and 19 nt in MII oocytes of PIWIL3associated piRNAs, confirming that the length of PIWIL1and PIWIL3-associated piRNAs sequenced is consistent with that observed on the gels. Then we divided into two groups using the length of PIWIL1-associated piRNAs in MII oocyte; Oocyte long piRNAs (L1 OoL-piRNAs) and Oocyte short piRNAs (L1 OoS-piRNAs) for further analysis. Sequencing also revealed that the piRNA populations in all samples showed a strong 1U bias, a conserved characteristic for piRNAs ( Figure 5A-E) . We then mapped piRNAs to the new hamster genome (hamster.sequel.draft-20200302.arrow.fasta). Among the PIWI-associated piRNA reads, 50.0-67.4% of the reads were uniquely mapped to the genome and 6.2-43.3% were mapped multiple times ( Figure 6A, upper panel) . Then, we annotated each piRNA read to analyze the genomic region from which the piRNA reads were generated. Approximately 79.05-89.84% of the reads mapped to unannotated intergenic regions, and only 7.07-13.19% originated from TEs ( Figure 6A, lower panel) . This profile is similar to that of pachytene piRNAs associated with mouse MIWI, in which \u223c70% is derived from intergenic regions and \u223c24% from TEs (33) .",

This observation is consistent with the fact that the main targets of the piRNA pathway in mouse testes are L1 and IAP elements. In the mouse genome, L1 is the most active TE family, as represented by an increasing accumulation of their young copies (Supplementary Figure S4B ). There are also young LTR retrotransposons in mice, among which IAP and MERVL (ERV3/ERVL) families are highly active, while ERV2/ERVK families, except IAPs, showed much lower proportions among the young elements (Supplementary Figure S4C ). Interestingly, most LTR retro- To simplify the graph, we omitted lines between the identical chromosomes within the same columns. Brown blocks show the existence of a proto-chromosome in the ancestral Cricetidae karyotype. We confirmed the previous speculation that mouse chromosomes 5 and 16 obtained blocks from a common Muridae proto-chromosome (light-orange), and that chromosomes 10, 15 and 17 obtained blocks from a common Cricetidate proto-chromosome (maroon blocks). We also identified two groups of mouse chromosomes (6, 8) and (8, 13) having large blocks from common Muridae proto-chromosomes. transposons from which piRNAs in hamster female gonads were derived were evolutionally younger judged by the K2P divergence ( Figure 4C ). This suggests that hamster oocyte piRNAs were generated from the higher activity of recent transposition. In contrast, testis PIWIL1-piRNAs target both LINEs and LTR retrotransposons. Together with the diversity in PIWI-associated piRNA sequences of the oocyte and testis ( Figure 6B ), this supports the notion that PIWI-piRNA target TEs are different for male and female gonads. test whether these piRNAs are derived from the same genomic loci and whether L1 OoS-piRNAs and/or PIWIL3associated piRNAs are processed products of L1 OoL-piRNAs by cleaving and/or trimming their 3 -ends. To this end, we asked whether the genomic positions of the 5 -or 3ends of the L1 OoL-piRNAs differ from those of L1 OoS-piRNAs or PIWIL3-piRNAs and calculated the probabilities of the 5 -or 3 -ends of L1 OoL-piRNAs coinciding with the 5 -or 3 -ends of L1 OoS-piRNAs or PIWIL3-piRNAs (18) . In MII oocytes, L1 OoL-piRNAs were much more likely to share 5 -ends with L1 OoS-piRNAs and PIWIL3-piRNAs (Oo PIWIL3) than with 3 -ends (0.65 for 5 -ends versus 0.03 for 3 -ends and 0.54 for 5 -ends versus 0.02 for 3 -ends, respectively; Figure 7A ). These results suggest that approximately half of these three piRNA populations share the same 5 cleaved piRNA precursors, thereby sharing the same piRNA clusters as piRNA sources. Thus the size differences among these piRNAs account for their 3 -end formation of these populations that may be determined by the footprint of piRNA-binding PIWI proteins, probably because of either the structures of partner PIWI proteins (in particular, the distance between MID-PIWI and PAZ domains) or conformational changes in the partner proteins (see Discussion). The finding that piRNA populations in oocytes share the same 5 cleaved piRNA precursors suggests little pingpong amplification among them. We calculated the pingpong signature of each piRNA and found that they had little or no ping-pong signatures ( Figure 7B ). This result indicates that most of the piRNAs expressed in oocytes are not involved in the ping-pong cycle. Recently, a novel class of small RNAs with 21-23 nt, termed short PIWI-interacting RNAs (spiRNAs), was identified in mouse oocytes (41) . They are produced by the ping-pong cycle driven by the MILI slicer activity, and thus, small piRNAs found in hamster oocytes are distinct from spiRNAs.",

In the testis, both unidirectional clusters, in which piRNAs map to only one strand, and bidirectional clusters, in which the polarity of piRNA production switches between plus and minus strands, were identified, although unidirectional clusters were dominant ( Figure 8A and Supplementary Figure  S7A ). We found that the majority of the piRNA clusters identified in female gonads were unidirectional ( Figure 8B and Supplementary Figure S6A) .",

We next examined overlaps among ovaries, MII oocytes, and 2-cell embryo PIWIL1 piRNA clusters and found that they shared 31 clusters (Figure 8D ).

PIWIL3-associated piRNAs shared 77% of the clusters with PIWIL1-associated piRNAs in MII oocytes. These results are consistent with the findings that PIWIL1-and PIWIL3-associated piRNA populations are likely to share the same 5 cleaved piRNA precursors ( Figure 7A ). Finally, we found that piRNAs loaded onto PIWIL3 in MII oocytes shared a large number of piRNA clusters with piRNAs loaded onto PIWIL1 in 2-cell embryos, suggesting that they may have common targets ( Figure 8E ). Given that the transcription of piRNA clusters greatly differs in male and female gonads, we analyzed the motif sites surrounding the potential transcription start sites of the testis and ovary piRNA clusters. We first extracted sequences surrounding the transcriptional start sites of unidirectional and bidirectional piRNA clusters, predicted from small RNA-seq and RNA-seq mapping data. We used these sequences and performed motif searches using MEME v.5.1.0, which can discover motifs enriched in the given dataset. The results of the MEME analysis show that the A-Myb binding site is significantly represented in the bidirectional piRNA clusters in the testis transcriptional start site surrounding regions (Supplementary Figure S6B) , where it was under-represented in the ovary transcriptional start site surrounding regions (data not shown). Moreover, we calculated the expression level of A-Myb family homolog genes in hamster testis, ovary, and oocyte using RNA-seq data, and found that A-Myb was especially highly expressed in the testis (TPM = 66.33), whereas it was hardly expressed in the ovary and oocyte (TPM = 2.02 in the ovary and was not detected in MII oocytes, respectively) (Supplementary Figure S6C) , consistent with previous findings that in mice, A-Myb is expressed only in the testis, but not in the female gonads (35) . It has been previously shown that A-Myb regulates transcription of piRNA clusters in mice and roosters (35) . These results suggest that piRNA clusters in hamster testes may also be regulated by the transcription factor A-Myb.",

Alternatively, PIWIL1-associated short piRNAs may not be the processed products of loaded long piRNAs, but they may be produced by a mechanism similar to that produced by long piRNAs and then loaded onto either newly produced PIWIL1 or PIWIL1, which has unloaded piR-NAs. Because it is thought that the size of small guide RNAs is determined by the footprint of small RNA-binding Argonaute/PIWI proteins (28) , the change in the size of PIWIL1-associated piRNAs implies a change in the structure of the protein that accommodates short piRNAs. The question is how the change in the structure of PIWIL1 is induced to either unload long piRNAs or reload short piR-NAs or to conclude the production of short piRNAs, but not long piRNAs, from intermediates, of which the 5 -ends are likely anchored within the MID-PIWI domain of PI-WIL1. It is known that the release of the 3 -end of the guide small RNA from the PAZ domain of some bacterial Argonaute proteins occurs during target recognition, which is accompanied by conformational changes in the PAZ domain (81, 82) . A recent study has also shown that disengagement of the small RNA 3 -end from the PAZ domain occurs during the mammalian Argonaute activity cycle (83) . Thus, it is tempting to speculate that conformational changes in PIWIL1, either upon target recognition of long piRNAloaded PIWIL1 or by hitherto unknown mechanisms, may occur to conclude the production of short piRNAs. In other words, PIWIL1 could switch between states of structural rearrangements to produce two types of piRNAs. In this context, it is interesting that short piRNAs are loaded onto PI-WIL3 when the protein is heavily phosphorylated. Indeed, we demonstrated that phosphorylation is required for PI-WIL3 to associate with piRNAs. It is known that the loading of small guide RNAs onto Argonaute proteins appears to be affected by phosphorylation, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood (84) . Phosphorylation could induce changes in the structure of PIWIL3 so that the protein is loaded with processed intermediates of piRNA precursors and the footprint of the protein determines the size of loaded piRNAs. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, PIWIL3 may need to be phosphorylated to stably hold piRNAs. Our findings suggest that hamster PIWI proteins in the oocyte can alternate between states (allostery). It will be interesting to model the structural changes in the PIWI protein using published data on structures of PIWI proteins and other Argonaute proteins.",

Two dis-Nucleic Acids Research, 2021 , Vol. 49, No. 5 2717 tinct piRNA populations are present in mouse testes: prepachytene piRNAs are enriched in TE-derived sequences (approximately 80% of the total) (32) and pachytene piR-NAs have a higher proportion of unannotated sequences, with diminished contribution from TE-derived sequences (\u223c25%) (10, 11) . These piRNAs guide PIWI proteins to target LINE1 and IAP elements and repress them either by cleaving their transcripts in the cytoplasm or by modifying their chromatin loci in the nucleus (4, 5) . Recent studies also support a model in which TE-derived piRNAs serve as a guide to selectively target young L1 families for de novo DNA methylation (89) or H3K9me3 modification (90) in fetal testes. However, the Slicer activity of both MIWI and MILI is still required to maintain TE silencing in the mouse testis after birth, suggesting that continuous cleavage of TE transcripts by the Slicer activity is essential for repressing TEs in mouse testes (33, 34) . We found that the contents of PIWIL1-and PIWIL3-associated piRNAs in hamster oocytes are similar to those observed in mouse pachytene piRNAs. However, the major target TEs in the piRNA pathway in hamster oocytes appear as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), including ERV2 families. Indeed, our results are concordant with the fact that 41.5% of recently active LTR retrotransposons are accounted for by ERV2 families such as ERV2-7 MAu and ERV2-5 MAu. The differences in piRNA targets between testes and oocytes suggest the possibility that the activity of IAP and these ERV2 elements might be distinctively controlled and their young copies in the genome might have jumped in different types of germline cells. Recent studies have shown that ERVs, which constitute a large portion (8\u223c10%) of mammalian genomes (91) , have a significant impact on shaping transcriptomes and DNA methylation patterns (methylomes) in mammalian oocytes in a species-specific manner (92) . These oocyte transcriptomes and methylomes in mammals are defined by a balance between activation and repression of ERVs. Thus, the piRNA pathway is likely to contribute to the formation of species-specific transcriptomes and methylomes in oocytes. Indeed, it was recently shown that unmethylated IAP promoters in Miwi2-deficient mouse testes rewire the transcriptome by driving the expression of neighboring genes (93) . This also implies that spermatogonial dysfunction, observed in PIWI-deficient mice, may not simply be due to deregulation of TEs but due to transcriptional rewriting. It will be interesting to see if the lack of PIWIL1 or PIWIL3 leads to dysfunctions in hamster oocytes.",

This is in agreement with previous studies with total small RNA-seq of ovaries, indicating that piRNAs in human and bovine ovaries mostly share common piRNA clusters with piRNAs in testes (38, 39) . However, a recent study showed that only about 30% of human oocyte piRNA clusters overlapped with the human testis-piRNA clusters, proving that testes and oocytes differentially express piRNA clusters (40) . Our study, together with that of human oocyte piRNAs, suggest a model in which the expression of oocyte and testis piRNA clusters have different functions with distinct targets. Transcriptional factors that regulate their expression are also distinct, though further analysis, including ATACseq to define transcription start sites of piRNA precursors, will be needed to identify the transcriptional factors responsible for piRNA clusters in hamster oocytes. In addition, we demonstrated that nearly half of the two populations of PIWIL1-associated piRNAs in oocytes share common clusters and that nearly half of PIWIL3-associated piR-NAs in MII oocytes map to clusters from which PIWIL1associated piRNAs are derived. These results suggest the possibility that a considerable portion of oocyte piRNA cluster transcripts are processed by a common biogenesis pathway but are loaded onto distinct PIWI proteins.",

Our newly assembled golden hamster genome will also greatly promote the use of golden hamster as a model to understand human disease.",

The sizes of PIWIL1-associated piRNAs in whole ovaries and 2-cell embryos were 29-30 nt and 22-23 nt, respectively PIWIs are expressed in hamster oocytes. (A) Expression patterns of PIWI families in male and female hamsters. Transcriptome data were obtained from Illumina HiSeq2000. The x-axis suggests the normalized expression level (TPM). (B) Protein homology of PIWIL3 in hamster and human. Approximately 74.6% of the PAZ domain and 83.3% of the PIWI domain in hamster PIWIL3 are conserved in human PIWIL3. The large extension of the amino-terminal portion of the ORF, which contains 14 repeats of nucleotide sequences encoding the amino acid sequences QLQSPGAGPPRSGA is presented in hamster PIWIL3. (C) PIWIL1 (upper panel) and PIWIL3 (lower panel) levels from an ovary. Immunostaining with PIWIL1 and PIWIL3 are shown: (green) PIWIL1 and PIWIL3; (blue) Hoechst. The signal in the zona pellucida at upper panel is the autofluorescence. (D) Western blotting was performed from hamster whole ovaries, MII oocytes, and 2-cell embryos with anti-PIWIL3, anti-PIWIL1, and anti-\u2424-TUBULIN antibodies. The size of the PIWIL3 protein largely shifted by approximately 40 kDa in MII oocytes. The anti-MARWI (PIWIL1) antibody (1A5) and anti-PIWIL3 antibody (3E12) detected a single band in each sample except for MII oocytes. (E) Western blotting was performed from hamster MII oocytes with (+) or without (\u2212) CIP treatment. A discrete band migrated to the estimated molecular weight of 130 kDa in the CIP-treated sample, demonstrating that PIWIL3 is heavily phosphorylated in MII oocytes.",
