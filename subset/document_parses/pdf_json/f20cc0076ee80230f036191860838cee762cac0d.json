Our aim was to demonstrate a novel use of statistical process control to provide timely and interpretable displays of COVID-19 data that inform local mitigation and containment strategies. Healthcare and other industries use statistical process control to study variation and disaggregate data for purposes of understanding behavior of processes and systems and intervening on them. We developed control charts at the county and city/ neighborhood level within one state (California) to illustrate their potential value for decisionmakers. We found that COVID-19 rates vary by region and subregion, with periods of exponential and non-exponential growth and decline. Such disaggregation provides granularity that decision-makers can use to respond to the pandemic. The annotated time series presentation connects events and policies with observed data that may help mobilize and direct the actions of residents and other stakeholders. Policy-makers and communities require access to relevant, accurate data to respond to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Control charts could prove valuable given their potential ease of use and interpretability in real-time decision-making and for communication about the pandemic at a meaningful level for communities.",

Enacting sensible public policies in the COVID-19 pandemic requires real-time data that public leaders can easily interpret and act on. The constituencies for these data are expanding as regional and community stakeholders, including cities, businesses, and school districts, assume decision-making roles in the emergency response. Moreover, given that public health interventions require public cooperation and trust in guidance and decisions that are data-driven, there is also a need to engage the public at large to successfully implement mitigation and containment strategies. Offering data to inform policy and individual health behavior is a cornerstone of prevention and public health practice [1] .",

Such displays often use maps, day-to-day percentage changes, and cumulative counts that refresh daily. These formats obscure variation across places, populations, and time, which are essential to learning how actions and events affect COVID-19 cases and deaths. Over-aggregation impairs the ability of decision-makers to make real-time policy adjustments and to assess the impact of these adjustments.

By distinguishing random (\"common cause\") variation from non-random (\"special cause\") variation, control charts reduce over-reaction to noise in data while enabling timely response when true signals show that conditions are improving or deteriorating [11] . They enable scientists, policy-makers, and community members alike to learn if a change to a policy or process has affected an outcome of interest [11] [12] [13] . Control charts can be used for multiple common types of data distributions including classification (binomial) P charts, continuous (Xbar charts) and individuals (I charts), and count (Poisson) C charts or U charts [12] .",

The exponential growth phase is modeled by the log-linear regression I-chart [12] . We used model coding in R developed by Perla et al. [21, 22] to transform the counts using the log10 function and calculated the intercept and slope through regression analysis for the log10 data; the regression line becomes the centerline (CL). Limits for the exponential phase in the charts are calculated from the median moving range of the residuals, with the upper limit (UL) and lower limit (LL) calculated as CL+3.14 \ufffd MRbar and CL-3.14 \ufffd MRbar, respectively. The CL, UL, and LL were then transformed to the original count scale. Charts that do not display an exponential growth phase are in C-chart format for the full period studied.",

For the exponential Epochs 2 and 3, we used Shewhart criteria modified by Perla et al.

The rationale is that COVID-19 data displays more than \"usual\" variation in the form of single large values that reflect \"data dumps\" from reporting entities; requiring a stronger signal prevents such a data artifact from triggering a new phase [22] .",

It is common practice in control charts to remove special cause variation due to such cyclic behavior by separating data lines within a chart or by subgrouping by a larger unit (i.e. week rather than day) to smooth variation. In this study, we preserved daily periodicity based on the statistical principles underlying control chart methodology, which is that data should not be summarized if it would mislead the user into taking actions that would not be taken had the original data been preserved [6] . Smoothing the data in these COVID-19 control charts would temper but not remove the apparent case reporting artifact, and seeing these patterns offers insights, namely that there is an impact from facility case reporting.",

California adopted six indicators for relaxing the initial safer-at-home order [32] and introduced a tiered system based on local data in October 2020 [33] as local authorities adopted additional policies. Disaggregation by region and time helps state, county, and within-county authorities act on the data. For example, local authorities could use the significant within-county variation to communicate to the public what is happening in specific neighborhoods and potentially to consider mitigation strategies that customize to subregions. Further, the study shows that a city could be mischaracterized as experiencing an outbreak of COVID-19 cases because case counts for the general public and congregate living populations are combined. This was especially relevant early in the pandemic when skilled nursing facilities accounted for a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases. Local jurisdictions may need this differentiation to target strategies-for example, if most cases are in congregate facilities. Disaggregated data could also enable a school district to consider if patterns in neighborhoods that feed into specific schools warrant augmented mitigation strategies.",

Users of these control charts can employ the Bradford Hill causality criteria to aid interpretation [34] . Additionally, complementing control charts with a small number of meaningful measures, such as residential density and household size, helps decision-makers and the public interpret observed variation by area and over time. Local health agencies could work with cities to identify appropriate measures that aid interpretation, such as housing features and rates of mask-wearing.

Reporting patterns by public health departments (e.g., batch reporting by facilities, weekday versus weekend reporting, inclusion of congregate living residents and homeless individuals in cumulative case reporting, availability of illness dates versus reporting dates) could shape how stakeholders interpret the data. At minimum, control charts can make these limitations transparent and prompt decision-makers to ask for more interpretable displays.

Rather than interpreting the data for action, the study intended to examine if areas exhibited variation and to illustrate the potential value of providing disaggregated data in control chart format to people who can make immediate use of them. Finally, COVID-19 case counts underestimate total COVID-19 cases, and there may be noise in the case counts that result from limited staffing for data entry, delayed reporting of cases out of jurisdiction, and the impact of time-varying testing constraints and laboratory turn-around-time, among others, which may vary by county and over time.",

Clear, interpretable, disaggregated displays are essential tools for policy makers as they consider the health, economic, social, mental health, and educational burden of COVID-19 in their communities.

This may have been a missed opportunity as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed from an initial, centralized emergency response to a period of distributed decision-making on the part of employers, cities, school districts, and others. Healthcare organizations use control charts for learning and to encourage data-driven collective action [15, 35, 36] . Public health and population-oriented systems could also make use of this method. This statistical method provides an easy, effective, and inexpensive way for public health departments to meet some of the informational needs of governors, city councils, school boards, and the general public during an emergency response when timeliness of and insight from data are of utmost importance. Use of control charts in public health will require an appreciation of their value and investment of time and resources into their creation and use. ",
