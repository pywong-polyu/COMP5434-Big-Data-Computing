It is therefore important to motivate those who are less willing to be vaccinated. To address this issue, we conducted an online survey of 6232 Japanese people to investigate age-and gender-dependent differences in attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and the underlying psychological processes. We asked participants to read one of nine different messages about COVID-19 vaccination and rate their willingness to be vaccinated. We also collected their 17 social personality trait scores and demographic information. We found that males 10-20 years old were least willing to be vaccinated. We also found that prosocial traits are the driving force for young people, but the motivation in older people also depends on risk aversion and self-interest. Furthermore, an analysis of 9 different messages demonstrated that for young people (particularly males), the message emphasizing the majority's intention to vaccinate and scientific evidence for the safety of the vaccination had the strongest positive effect on the willingness to be vaccinated, suggesting that the \"majority + scientific evidence\" message nudges young people to show their prosocial nature in action.",

They also reported that older age and living alone were respectively positively and negatively associated with vaccination. A recent nudge study showed that a reminder message, which appeals to the sense of ownership, for the vaccine increases the vaccination rate mainly in elder people 2 . Females and lower income were reported to be often negatively associated with vaccination 3-5 . Consistently, most studies arguing that gender differences exist reported females have lower motivation to take the COVID-19 vaccine 6 . As for age, younger people are also less motivated to be vaccinated because of their perception of lower risk 7,8 . In the case of COVID-19, about 30% of infected people are asymptomatic, which may contribute to the spread of infection 9,10 . Therefore, it is critically important to promote the vaccination in young people who are less motivated.",

We then analyzed willingness and refusal scores by LASSO regression, identified the personality traits contributing to predict those scores at each individual level and investigated how the personality traits important for the prediction are different among different age and gender groups. We finally evaluated the effectiveness of the 9 different nudge messages for different age and gender groups to promote willingness and reduce refusal of the vaccination. Table 1 displays the demographic decompositions of the participants who showed high degrees of willingness or refusal of the COVID-19 vaccination. For willingness (Question A), if a participant responded 1) not at all to 3) not much, we judged the participant had a low likelihood of getting the vaccine (score: \u22121). On the other hand, if a participant responded 5) somewhat to 7) definitely, we judged the participant had a high likelihood of www.nature.com/scientificreports/ getting the vaccine (score: + 1). Neutral response 4) was scored 0. Similarly, for refusal of the vaccine (Question B), if a participant responded 1) as soon as possible to 3) one year ahead, the participant was regarded as wanting the vaccination immediately (score: -1). On the other hand, response 4) two years to 6) five years ahead were judged as intending to be vaccinated sooner or later (score: 0). If a participant responded 7) never, we judged that the participant would always refuse the vaccination (score: 1). These scores were also used in the subsequent multiple linear regression analysis of the willingness and refusal scores by demographic decomposition. Overall, 68.5% (n = 4270) and 12.0% (n = 745) of the participants showed high willingness and refusal of the vaccination, respectively. Participants who were young, with no underlying diseases, with low annual income, with a low level of usual preventive attitude, and working in a workplace not related to healthcare had a significantly lower likelihood of getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

The lower panels represent p-values of t-tests between the two groups. Significance after the correction for multiple comparisons is indicated by *. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Table 2 summarizes the results of the multiple linear regression of the willingness and refusal scores by demographic information. We found a significant gender difference (lower in females) in the willingness to be vaccinated, consistent with previous reports on gender differences in the level of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance 3, 17 . We also found that a younger age, no underlying disease, low annual income, workplace unrelated to healthcare and low level of usual preventive attitude are associated with a significantly lower likelihood of getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Figure 1 visualizes the relative differences in the mean willingness and refusal scores (group mean minus total mean) for age and gender separately. The two-tailed p-values of t-tests between the two groups were calculated and are shown in the lower panels. For the participants' willingness ( Fig. 1a) , males in their 50 s showed significantly higher motivation towards being vaccinated than males in their 10-20 s or 40 s. Females in their 40 s showed significantly lower motivation than females in their 50 s. As for the refusal to be vaccinated (Fig. 1b) , males in their 50 s showed a significantly lower likelihood of refusal than males in any other age group. Females in their 50 s also showed a lower likelihood of refusal than females in their 10-20 s. All these results clarified that people (males in particular) in their 10-20 s are the least willing and most likely to refuse the vaccination, making a sharp contrast with people in their 50 s, who are most willing and least likely to refuse the vaccination.",

UD, underlying disease; INF, infected close relative; WP, workplace; area, place of residence; income, annual income. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ scores and the willingness to be vaccinated, we conducted a LASSO regression of the 7-scale original responses for Question A. LASSO can deal with a large dimensionality of explanatory variables arising from the interaction terms of variables and select the effective explanatory variables sparsely (weights for many non-effective explanatory variables are estimated to be 0) with non-zero weights (beta values) meaning a significant contribution. As the explanatory variables, all social personality scores and demographic information together with the interactions of social personality trait scores with the age and gender variable were used (see Methods for details). Table 3 summarize the LASSO results for Question A and Question B. For the willingness, agreeableness (Big5_A) had heavy weights in almost all ages and genders, while altruism (TRU_GSS) had a large weight only for females in their 40 s, whose Big5_A weight was 0. These results demonstrated that the tendency towards prosocial and empathetic considerations increased the motivation to be vaccinated overall. Importantly, among males, the weight of Big5_A was markedly greater for 10-20 s. The weight of prosocial score (SVO_P) was also only large for males in their 10-20 s. In females, the weight of trait fairness (TRU_WVS) was greater for 10-20 s. All these data clarified that for 10-20 s, prosocial consideration rather than their own interest is the major driving force of the willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccination, and this tendency is stronger in males.",

These stress-related and other-regarding scores promoted the willingness to be vaccinated in participants in their 30 s and 40 s, suggesting that the infection and serious illness were not considered to be someone else's problem. Importantly, this view was also consistent with the positive weight of individualistic traits (SVO_I) for males in their 40 s, indicating they regarded vaccination as a measure to protect their own health. In addition, the weight of anxiety (STAI_T) was positive for females in their 40 s and (STAI_S) was positive for females in their 50 s, revealing a connection with a fear of infection.

Although the personality traits having positive weights for refusal were less frequent because the overall basic trend was a willingness to be vaccinated, personality traits contributing to refusal differed depending on age and gender (Table 3b ). Neuroticism (Big5_N) was likely to lead to refusal in many groups, and for people in their 30 s or older, risk aversion (RA) and loss aversion (LAR) were also associated with refusal. Importantly, positive weights for individualistic trait (SVO_I) in males in their 10-20 s and for openness (Big5_O) in both genders in their 10-20 s indicated that individualistic young people were optimistic about their own infection and thereby did not feel vaccination was necessary if they only thought about themselves. Overall, our results demonstrated that younger people vaccinate mainly for others, while in older people, the contributions of self-regarding considerations increase. In particular, males in their 10-20 s had a strong tendency to be vaccinated for others and refused for themselves, resulting in their low willingness to be vaccinated (Fig. 1 ).",

            "text": "An effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is to increase vaccination rates among young people, especially males, considering their minimum willingness to be vaccinated, as identified above. Nudging has been shown to be a useful measure to increase people's prosocial behaviors while keeping their freedom of choice 18 . In the context of COVID-19, altruistic messages were shown to be effective at preventing infection 19,20 . However, the differences in vaccination-promoting personality traits in different age and gender groups suggest that the effectiveness of nudge messages also differs between these groups. We therefore investigated the effects of nine different nudge messages (see Appendix 1 online), including altruistic messages as a control. In brief, nudge 1 emphasized the altruism in gain framing, nudge 2 showed scientific evidence in gain framing, nudge 3 showed scientific evidence in loss framing, nudge 4 = nudge 2 + nudge 1, nudge 5 = nudge 3 + nudge 1, nudge 6 = nudge 2 + altruism in loss framing, nudge 7 = nudge 3 + altruism in loss framing, nudge 8 = nudge 2 + majority, and nudge 9 = nudge 3 + majority. Figure 2 illustrates the proportion of answers to the questions about willingness (Question A) and refusal (Question B) to the vaccination after reading one of the 9 different nudge messages. As with Table 1 , answers 6 and 7 (cyan and blue) indicated strong willingness. Compared to the control altruistic nudge (1), nudge 8 showed an increase in the strong willingness ratio among males in their 10-20 s (blue asterisk, p = 0.049). The strong willingness ratio of males in their 30 s and 40 s was sharply decreased for nudge 2 (black crosses, p = 0.041 and 0.023, respectively). By contrast, nudges 2-5 showed an increase in the ratio of strong willingness for females in their 30 s (blue asterisk, p = 0.046, 0.0074, 0.039, and 0.00070, respectively) and nudge 7 showed an increase in the ratio of strong willingness for females in their 40 s (blue asterisk, p = 0.035). No nudge message decreased the strong motivation to vaccinate. For refusal, answer 7 (black) represented the refusal to be vaccinated. The only message that significantly increased the refusal rate was nudge 2 for males in their 10-20 s (black asterisk, p = 0.014). The key message from these results is that nudge message 8, which was designed to emphasize the majority's vaccination intention in addition to scientific evidence of safety, is effective on males in their 10-20 s, while nudge messages 3 and 5, which appealed to loss (prospect of increased infections in the case without vaccination), are effective on females in their 30 s. These nudges are likely to be applicable to work on the least motivated groups (i.e., males in their 10-20 s and females in their 30 s and 40 s). By contrast, nudge message 2 is likely least effective on males in their 10-20 s.",

Importantly, the positive weight for agreeableness in people in their 10-20 s clarified that this effect is particularly strong in young people.

            "text": "In this study, we asked a large Japanese sample (N = 6232) to read one of 9 different messages about COVID-19 vaccination and to report their degrees of willingness and refusal to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. We also collected 17 social personality trait scores and demographic information. We analyzed differences in the willingness and refusal to be vaccinated and the underlying psychological processes in an age-and gender-dependent manner. In particular, we found that a \"majority + scientific evidence\" message (nudges 8 and 9) promote young people to show their prosocial nature in COVID-19 vaccination. The overall vaccine acceptance rate was 68.6%, a comparable value with a previous report in Japan 22 , although the acceptance rate has been reported to vary in different countries, regions, and the period of time of the data collection 23 . We confirmed that factors including being female, younger age, lower income, no medical problems, and a non-medical workplace were associated with lower motivation to be vaccinated, which is consistent with previous studies 3, 17, 22 . Importantly, the present study revealed that males in their 10-20 s are less motivated to be vaccinated than other groups, and also that prosocial and empathetic consideration, such as agreeableness, fairness, and empathetic concerns, is the driving force of the willingness in younger age groups, while in older people, risk aversion and self-interest are also involved. We also conducted LASSO regression to investigate the social personality traits that motivate COVID-19 vaccination in an age-and gender-dependent manner and found that agreeableness, willingness to protect others and the risk perception of infection generally contribute to the motivation for vaccination in a similar manner to previous studies 16, 24 . For males in their 10-20 s, who were the least motivated for vaccination, agreeableness followed by inequity aversion and prosocial orientation (preference of joint benefits and dislike of inequity) in social value orientation [25] [26] [27] contributed to the motivation (Table 3) . Furthermore, by evaluating the effectiveness of 9 different messages to promote vaccination, we found www.nature.com/scientificreports/ that emphasizing the majority's positive attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination plus the scientific evidence of safety (i.e., nudge message 8) is most effective for young groups, particularly males in their 10-20 s. Although the effect size of this message is not very high, this report provides the first identification of an effective message for young people. This group is an especially important target for vaccinations, because it is likely to be asymptomatic and social, and thus can enlarge the infected population unwittingly. It was reported that nudges are effective at promoting COVID-19 prevention measures 15, 28 and that vaccination motivation was promoted by nudge interventions 2, 29 . As a general strategy of nudges, factors including framing, tone, sense of ownership and sender of the message are known to influence whether the reader understands and is motivated by the message 30, 31 . However, it was also reported that different nudges make little difference in the context of vaccinations 32 . It is therefore important to clarify why the message emphasizing \"majority's intention to vaccinate + scientific evidence of safety\" is effective for young groups, particularly males in their 10-20 s, in the present study.",

However, our analysis of psychological processes demonstrated that the willingness of males in their 10-20 s to vaccinate comes from their prosocial and empathetic inclination rather than an obeyance to social rules and norms (consider that neither Big5_C nor ES_S contribute to the willingness to be vaccinated in younger groups). Therefore, it is more likely that the herding effect arising from the \"majority's intention to COVID-19 vaccination + scientific evidence of safety\" effectively nudged young people to exhibit Table 4 .

It is also noteworthy that neither strong discomfort nor resentment was reported from those who received this message ( Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S2 online). It is puzzling that the effect of nudge message 1 (altruism) was less effective than nudge message 8 (majority + scientific evidence), considering that altruism and agreeableness were the strongest motivators for young people's inoculation. Head-off effects explain that nudges sometimes do not work on people who have already enough preventive attitudes 36 . Therefore, one possible interpretation of our findings is that the emphasis on the majority's intention to vaccinate and scientific evidence of safety is more effective than the altruistic message due to head-off effects in the context of COVID-19 vaccination. Related to this, the indirectness of the altruistic message may also explain this result. That is, the onset protection effect of the vaccine was established scientifically, but the prevention effect of infection was still being discussed. Therefore, we could only imply in nudge 1 that the self-prevention of infection by vaccination helps others by sparing the number of hospital beds, rather than directly protecting the other's onset.",

For males in their 50 s, in addition to empathy and agreeableness, trust and subjective socioeconomic status played a major role, suggesting that this group is sensitive to the expectation of society when making decisions, i.e., social norms, as higher subjective socioeconomic status promoted stronger motivation to vaccinate. The relatively high willingness of this last group to vaccinate in response to nudge message 8 (Fig. 2a) is likely to reflect at least partly their inclination to conform to others (i.e., social norm pressure), as proposed by Sasaki and colleagues 37 , which contrasts with people in their 10-20 s.",

Related to this, it was reported that higher education is linked to a greater willingness to vaccinate 23 . Our results suggest that this tendency may be stronger in females. For females in their 10-20 s, 30 s, and 40 s, the degree of perceiving others as fair (TRU_WVS), agreeableness, and altruism, respectively, contributed to the willingness to vaccinate, indicating the general tendency that the contribution of prosocial inclination is stronger in females. For females in their 50 s, the contribution of empathy became stronger. Females overall, especially in their 40 s were less willing to vaccinate than males (Fig. 1a) , but at the same time, they were not actively refusing vaccination (Fig. 1b) . We think that their lower willingness to vaccinate is attributable to differences in lifestyle and social roles between genders.",

It was reported that an increase in motivation does not always lead to an actual change in behaviors 2,38-40 . Whether motivation causes behavioral change is an important topic for future investigation. Second, although we identified an effective nudge message for young people with prosocial and empathetic orientation, we still do not have an effective way to nudge young people who have proself orientation. This too is worth future study. The third limitation is cultural differences regarding the majority. Because higher in-group conformity is known for Japanese people 41 , it is necessary to examine whether messages emphasizing the majority is generally effective for young people in other cultures. Fourth, we did not include a direct question about the degree to which the participants perceived themselves to be at risk for COVID-19, although the perception of risk was reported as an important factor for determining vaccination attitudes 1, 9, 10 . We believe that the usual preventive attitudes against COVID-19 reflected risk perceptions and were strongly related to a willingness or refusal to be vaccinated (Tables 1 and 2 ). Fifth, we did not directly assess the trust of the information source about vaccines or the vaccines themselves. It was reported that this trust affects the willingness to be vaccinated 17, 42 . However, we believe that the contribution of risk aversion and loss aversion to the refusal to vaccinate reflects low trust in the information source, at least partly, which rules out the possibility that failure to include trust largely affected the results of the present paper. Last, but not least, although we examined gender differences, we emphasize our findings do not reflect biological differences, but rather cultural and societal differences related to gender. Despite these limitations, the nudge messages effective for young people, and the age-and genderdependent differences in attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination we report in this study should provide useful insights into the promotion of COVID-19 vaccination.",

To assess the age-and gender-dependent impact on the willingness to vaccinate, we compared the ratios of the participants who were strongly motivated to vaccinate (i.e., Question A, 6 or 7) between the control nudge (nudge 1) and other nudges in each age and gender group. To assess the effect to reduce the refusal to vaccinate, the ratios of people who rejected vaccination (i.e., Question B, 7) between the control nudge (nudge 1) and other nudges were compared. A function of R, prop.test, was used to test the difference in proportions, with the significance level being a one-tailed p = 0.05.",
