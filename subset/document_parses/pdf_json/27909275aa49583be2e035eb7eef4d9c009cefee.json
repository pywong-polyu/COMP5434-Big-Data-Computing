The earlier lung disease pneumonia is closely related to Covid-19, as several patients died due to high chest congestion (pneumonic condition). It is challenging to differentiate Covid-19 and pneumonia lung diseases for medical experts. The chest X-ray imaging is the most reliable method for lung disease prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the lung disease predictions like pneumonia and Covid-19 from the chest X-ray images of patients. The framework consists of dataset acquisition, image quality enhancement, adaptive and accurate region of interest (ROI) estimation, features extraction, and disease anticipation. In dataset acquisition, we have used two publically available chest X-ray image datasets.",

For accurate ROI extraction of chest regions, we have designed a modified region growing technique that consists of dynamic region selection based on pixel intensity values and morphological operations. For accurate detection of diseases, robust set of features plays a vital role. We have extracted visual, shape, texture, and intensity features from each ROI image followed by normalization. For normalization, we formulated a robust technique to enhance the detection and classification results. Soft computing methods such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), ensemble classifier, and deep learning classifier are used for classification. For accurate detection of lung disease, deep learning architecture has been proposed using recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM). Experimental results show the robustness and efficiency of the proposed model in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art methods.",

It has been reported that more than 63.2 million people have already been infected in the world which includes approximately 1.47 million deaths. The world health organization (WHO) continuously provides the necessary information for nations to protect against Covid-19 (Fong et al. 2021) . Countries like United States, India, Brazil, Russia, France, Italy, China are the highly suffered nations from this threat (Salepci et al. 2020) . No vaccine for this threat has been developed in the first 6-8 months of the Covid-19 as many countries were working on its production. Finally, a few countries have been able to develop vaccine for Covid-19, which is still in the development or testing stage. The people infected from Covid-19 have moderate or mild symptoms such as fever, cough, and breathe shortness. However, people suffered from severe pneumonic conditions in their lungs that resulted in death as well (Elibol 2020; Padda et al. 2020; Smith et al. 2020; Sharma et al. 2020) . Most of the people, died from Covid-19, had suffered high chest congestion (pneumonia) due to significant reduction in oxygen level which led to major heart attack (Chen et al. 2021 ). On the other hand, pneumonia is also a kind of lung disease that leads to inflammation in the small air sacs within the lungs of the human body.",

The WHO claims that approximately 8 million people have been suffered from lung cancer till date. But this number is not higher than the lung diseases caused by Covid-19 and pneumonia within 15 months. Several studies have been presented on lung cancer for its early prediction using computer vision and soft computing methods (Kumar et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018; Makaju et al. 2018) . Medical imaging techniques such as X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), isotope, etc., have been regularly used for detection of lung diseases. Among these, X-ray and CT images are frequently used by radiologists and physicians to discover lung diseases. Hence, many doctors recommend the chest X-ray for the lung diseases analysis, especially during the Covid-19 period. For many decades, medical practitioners have used the X-ray imaging to analyze and explore the various abnormalities in human body organs (Khatri et al. 2020) . Many studies revealed that X-ray technique is a cost-effective method for disease diagnosis while providing the pathological alterations along with its economic efficiency and non-invasive properties (Yasin et al. 2020 ). The lung infections in chest X-ray images have been found in the form of consolidations, blunted costophrenic angles, broadly distributed nodules, cavitations, and infiltrates (Angeline et al. 2020) . Therefore, radiologists detect several conditions like pneumonia, pleurisy, nodule, effusion, infiltration, fractures, pneumothorax, pericarditis using X-ray images (Padma and Kumari 2020; Rousan et al. 2020) .",

Therefore, it received significant attention from the researchers to develop automatic lung disease detection techniques (Avni et al. 2011; Jaeger et al. 2014; Pattrapisetwong and Chiracharit 2016) . Since the past decade, many computeraided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been introduced for lung disease detection using X-ray images. But such systems were failed to achieve the required performance for lung disease detection and classification. The recent Covid-19 assisted lung infections have made these tasks very challenging for such CAD systems. It is essential to detect the appearance of pneumonia in the lungs and its classification into Covid-19, bacterial, and viral infections. This classification provides appropriate medical attention to pneumonic patients. Several works have been presented with CAD systems for Covid-19, and automated image processing and deep learning techniques (Ge et al. 2019 ) have been developed for pneumonia disease detections using chest X-ray images. As deep learning is a fully automatic feature learning and extraction technique, it takes longer time for complete dataset training and detection. Therefore, such solutions are not reliable and robust against the increased number of datasets. Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN) gained attention for lung disease detection due to better accuracy and feature representation (Asuntha and Srinivasan 2020). However, computational complexity is not yet discussed and addressed by any of the research. The computational complexity of CNN is higher due to high-dimensional feature space for each X-ray image.",

The requirement of robust and reliable detection and classification of lung diseases (like Covid-19 and viral/bacterial pneumonia) motivates the proposed framework. The proposed model is called Fusion and normalization features based RNN-LSTM (F-RNN-LSTM). This consolidated framework focuses on the robustness and high performance with minimum computational efforts. The input raw X-ray image is pre-processed by applying the median filtering and histogram equalization techniques. To extract the region of interest (ROI) from the enhanced image, a dynamic region growing technique for the image of different modalities and dimensions has been proposed. The sets of feature vectors have been built from the ROI images using visual, texture, intensity and invariant moment features. We have also proposed a robust feature normalization technique to enhance the detection accuracy. After that, we have applied a number of machine learning and soft computing techniques for classification which includes SVM, ANN, KNN, and ensemble classifier. In addition to this, a deep learning approach using RNN with the LSTM model is designed to estimate the probabilities of lung conditions and early prediction to meet higher accuracy and minimum computational efforts. A deep experimental evaluation of the proposed model has been performed with the state-of-the-art Covid-19 detection methods.",

They designed and evaluated an automated CNN model for chest disease diagnosis using an X-ray image dataset. The author disclosed significant performance of the CNN model with other soft computing techniques in terms of training accuracy, testing accuracy, and training time. The pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images has been performed using computer vision and soft computing techniques in Varela-Santos and Melin (2020). In this method, ROI were extracted using the segmentation of X-ray images, followed by texture feature extraction, and then neural network was applied for classification. CNN was used for the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images in Lin et al. (2019) . They prepared dataset from the Kaggle repository and designed ConvNet to process the input X-ray image. Another lung disease detection approach using computer vision methods and cooperative CNN model was proposed in Wang et al. (2019) . The segmentation algorithm was applied to locate ROI in lung images and then local and global features were extracted for effective pneumonia classification. The cooperative CNN model was designed to perform the classification. Another deep learning-based approach was introduced in Thakur et al. (2021) where the author used a variant of CNN, called VGG16 for classification of pneumonia using X-ray chest images dataset. They used the transfer learning and fine-tuning approach during the learning phase. The approach for detecting pneumonia is proposed in Angeline et al. (2020) using X-ray images and CNN. They trained the CNN to classify the input X-ray image into normal or pneumonic class. The accurate and efficient pneumonia detection from the input chest X-ray images was presented in Sarkar et al. (2020) . They first pre-processed the input X-ray image using bilateral filtering and contrast enhancement techniques. For classification, they build deep residual learning with the separable convolutional networks. Another CNN-based pneumonia disease detection system was introduced in Nath and Choudhury (2020). They trained the X-ray images of normal and abnormal conditions and prepared a model to detect the presence of pneumonia. A weighted soft computing method was proposed in Hashmi et al. (2020) using weighted anticipations from the conventional deep learning systems like DenseNet121, MobileNetV3, Xception, and ResNet. A supervised learning mechanism was proposed to predict the outcomes according to dataset representation. The ensemble technique for pneumonia detection from the chest X-ray input images was proposed in Habib et al. (2020) . They designed a deep CNN model called CheXNet with VGG-19 for feature extraction. These features were ensembled for classification purposes. They introduced methods like synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), random over sampler (ROS), random under sample (RUS) to address the problem of data irregularity.",

Median filtering is a lightweight technique and commonly used in many image processing applications as it is more effective while considering the constraints of noise reduction and edge preservation. We used 2D median filtering in the proposed model that works by moving via the image pixel by pixel, replacing every value with the neighbouring pixel's median value.

In previous studies, the entire image was supplied to the network for feature extraction which results in redundant and irrelevant classification and poor severity analysis. The ROI extraction has been performed using image segmentation that detects the boundaries around the enhanced image. The image is divided into two regions-meaningful (white) and non-meaningful (black). The white areas represent the image ROI and are used in the feature extraction process. Although, several techniques are available for image segmentation; however, none of the existing works have used the ROI extraction approach for lung images to detect Covid-19 and pneumonia infections. The frequently used segmentation techniques are thresholding, binarization, K-means, watershed, Fuzzy C-means, and segmentation using optimization methods are ant colony optimization (ACO), genetic algorithm (GA), artificial bee colony (ABC). These methods suffer from problems such as over-segmentation, inaccurate ROI extraction, adaptability, and high computation time. This work propose an adaptive segmentation method based on region growing and morphological operations. The proposed segmentation method is aiming at accurate ROI extraction with minimum computation time. Algorithm 1 shows a simple and accurate approach for adaptive ROI extraction from an enhanced chest X-ray image. The first step is to detect the edges by applying the canny edge detection to preserve the edge information. The segmentation starts with the edge detected image which is divided into N number of grids. For each grid, we apply the dynamic thresholding approach to perform the segmentation. Once all grids are segmented, these are replaced in the original image. Post-processing has been applied to deliver accurate and original intensity information in ROI. In postprocessing, we first perform the morphological operations erosion and closing. Morphological erosion discards small objects and islands, and keeps only substantive regions. The morphological closing is applied to fill the small holes in erosion output and preserves the size and shape of segmented regions. Segmented areas are filled with the original intensity values of the enhanced image data for further processing. The key aspect of this approach is adaptive threshold computation for each input image. Dynamic thresholding is an effective technique for accurate ROI extraction while reducing the background noise. To compute the dynamic threshold T of the image I 2 , we used the following algorithm:",

Among all the features normalization techniques, the robust feature normalization method improved accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score metrics, compared to raw features and min-max normalization techniques. The raw features without applying any feature normalization led to poor classification performance. It clearly highlights the importance of using feature normalization in machine learning applications. The detection accuracy (Fig. 5 and Table 6 ) shows that the min-max normalization improved the accuracy approximately by 4%, and robust normalization improved the accuracy approximately by 6% when compared to raw features. A similar trend has been observed for precision ( Fig. 6 and Table 7) , recall ( Fig. 7 and Table 8 ), specificity ( Fig. 8 and Table 9 ), and F1-score ( Fig. 9 and Table 10 ) for the C19RD dataset. We have shown the results for the soft computing methods using the C19RD dataset. Among all the soft computing methods, the proposed deep learning model F-RNN-LSTM showed enhanced lung disease classification performance. The performance of the KNN classifier is found to be poor than the all-other techniques using raw features, min-max normalization, and robust normalization. The ANN classifier has shown the second-best performance among all the soft computing techniques. Using the deep learning model RNN-LSTM, detection accuracy, and F1-score performance is increased by 4% approximately to the ANN. The proposed model F-RNN-LSTM using robust-normalization delivered the best classification performances with the highest accuracy and F1-score for the C19RD dataset. ",

The recent state-of-art methods have suffered from the high computation cost and has high detection time. In comparison to these, the proposed F-RNN-LSTM model reduces these computation efforts approximately by 50% and improves the detection accuracy by 2.5-3% approximately in comparison to the existing methods. The proposed model has reduced the computational efforts due to RNN with LSTM by using sequential learning that takes less time to compute the anticipation probabilities of each class during the training and disease detection process. Furthermore, detection accuracy has been improved for F-RNN-LSTM due to quality enhancement, accurate and robust ROI extraction, and lung-specific feature extraction. The existing techniques relied on pre-defined deep learning models for high dimensional feature extraction which limits the detection accuracy. Another purpose of extracting lung-specific features is to provide severity analysis for appropriate treatment purposes which is possible only with the proposed F-RNN-LSTM model. The outcome of the proposed model may be beneficial to the internet of things (IoT) enabled smart healthcare systems where disease detection and severity analysis is highly required (Patel et al. 2020; Mahajan et al. 2018; Mahajan and Badarla 2019; Mahajan et al. 2020) .

This model in quite different from the existing Covid-19 detection methods in the sense that it considers the lung specific features only by considering a proper image enhancement, followed by ROI based feature extraction and normalization. In order to enhance the classification performance with minimum computational efforts, we have proposed a deep learning model F-RNN-LSTM. The results have been shown for soft computing and machine learning techniques such as SVM, ANN and KNN as well as for F-RNN-LSTM using the publically available C19RD and CXIP datasets. Due to feature normalization and efficient feature vector representation, the proposed model F-RNN-LSTM shows the effective performance in term of detection accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and specificity. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evaluation of the proposed method has been performed with Chest Disease Detection using CNN (CDD-CNN)(Abiyev et al. 2018), Covid-19 Detection using Deep Learning (CDDL)(Pham 2021), COVIDe-tectioNet(Turkoglu 2021), CNN using ResNet23 (CNN-RN)(Butt et al. 2020), Se-ResNeXt-50(Hira et al. 2020), CNN using Ensemble approach (CNN-E)",
