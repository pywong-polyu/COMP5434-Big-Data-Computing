We recently showed that adults with severe covid-19 might experience symptoms for 3-6 months after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, mainly related to respiratory and circulatory conditions. 1 These findings are in accordance with a range of other reports showing increased risk of complications after serious covid-19 among adults, implying that severe disease has a considerable impact on long term use of healthcare. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Less is known about the potential long term sequelae after mild infection. 5 Except for the occurrence of the rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection 7 and a good prognosis in terms of disease severity and death, 8 9 far less is known about the impact of the disease on post-covid health and healthcare use among children. Existing studies are case reports and analyses of small populations (5-33 children) mostly with severe initial covid-19, with similar long term problems observed in children as in adults. 10 11 In a study of children with covid-19, more than half of 129 participants with mean age 11 years reported at least one persisting symptom 120 days after the initial infection. 11 This finding contrasts with that of two other studies, which reported persistent symptoms for at least three to four weeks after the initial infection in only 4% of 171 children of median age 3 years and 4% of 1734 children aged 5-17 years. 12 13 Neither of these studies are informative about the development and implementation of policies during the pandemic doi: 10 .1136/bmj-2021-066809 | BMJ 2022;376:e066809 | the bmj owing to their size, narrow selection criteria, or lack of a comparison group.",

Little is also known about whether healthcare use among children and adolescents is increased after initial disease, and how long the increase might persist for young compared with older children. A long term increase in specialist care visits after SARS-CoV-2 infection would imply that post-covid symptoms are severe for certain age groups, whereas a short term increase restricted to primary care would imply milder symptoms. Such knowledge could be used to upscale or downscale health services. We explored the short term (0-3 months) and long term (4-6 months) effects of potentially long lasting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the basis of healthcare use among children and adolescents aged 1-5, 6-15, and 16-19 years. Because covid-19 is usually less severe in young people, we hypothesised that healthcare use in children and adolescents would be less increased and shorter than observed among adults. 1 14 ",

BeredtC19 is an emergency preparedness register that aims to rapidly disseminate knowledge about the pandemic, including impacts of measures to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on health and use of healthcare services. 15 BeredtC19 compiles daily updated individual level data from several registers, including the Norwegian surveillance system for communicable diseases (all testing for SARS-CoV-2), the Norwegian Patient Register (electronic patient records from all hospitals in Norway), and the Norway Control and Payment of Health Reimbursement database (consultations with general practitioners and emergency primary healthcare) as well as the National Population Register (age, sex, country of birth, date of death). BeredtC19 therefore includes the dates of testing and results for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 reported by laboratories throughout Norway to the surveillance system for communicable diseases and electronic patient records from primary care as well as hospital based outpatient and inpatient specialist care. The establishment of an emergency preparedness register forms part of the legally mandated responsibilities of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health during epidemics.",

We also included untested children and randomly assigned to them a hypothetical test date. To account for temporal changes in testing intensity, the hypothetical test date was assigned so that the fraction of untested children with a test date in each calendar week was the same as the fraction of tested children with an actual test date in the same calendar week. Because testing intensity differed by age groups over time, this assignment was done separately for age group 1-5 years (preschool age), 6-15 years (primary and lower secondary school age), and 16-19 years (upper secondary school age). Because at the beginning of the pandemic (March-July 2020) children and adolescents were not included in test criteria, they were less frequently tested. We therefore restricted our study to the period 1 August 2020 to 1 February 2021, when PCR tests were widely available and the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection was at its beginning in Norway. Testing criteria during our study period indicated testing for everyone with acute respiratory tract infection or other symptoms of covid-19, close contacts of people with confirmed covid-19 (as a part of contact tracing), people arriving in Norway, people being admitted to certain healthcare institutions, and anyone who suspected they had covid-19. Specific advice for children and adolescents implied they should be tested in consultation with their parents and that those with a runny nose as the only symptom (without other signs of a newly arisen respiratory tract infection) were not in need of a test. Testing was free for residents, and test capacity was sufficient from August 2020.",

These analyses evaluate the effect of an event by comparing the change in the outcome for the affected group before and after the event with the change over the same time span in a group not affected by the event. [17] [18] [19] In this study we compared the rate of healthcare use in the months before and after the PCR test for participants who tested positive (first difference) with the difference in the rate of healthcare use in the months before and after the PCR test for participants with a negative test result for SARS-CoV-2 or untested controls (second difference). The difference-in-differences estimate is the difference between these two differences, estimated using linear probability models with robust standard errors and presented as the difference in percentage points. Statistically, an interaction term (between before and after PCR tests and covid-19 group category) is used to derive the difference-in-differences estimate. By including calendar month fixed effects, this approach accounts for background trends such as seasonal variations in healthcare use. 17 The differencein-differences estimate can be interpreted as the change in healthcare use that is related to covid-19, beyond any background calendar month trends. If no association is found between covid-19 and subsequent healthcare use, the difference-in-differences estimate would be zero.",

This is a standard way of allowing for time varying treatment effects, 18 19 which avoids having to impose a specific functional form on how time is modelled. This approach is implemented by including categorical variables for each of these extra periods and accompanying interaction terms. In this way, separate effects can be calculated for different post-test periods. In addition to the presentation of results as absolute differences in percentage points, we also present relative differences (in percentages) by dividing the absolute estimate (and corresponding lower and upper confidence interval bounds) for each of the post-test periods by the rate of healthcare use of the comparison group in the pre-test period (multiplied by 100).",

Difference-in-differences models are used in two data situations, one where different individuals are studied before and after the event, and another, which is the case in the current study, where the same individuals are followed from before to after the event. 18 Although adjusting for individual characteristics that are constant over time can be important in the first type of data situation to account for changes in composition, it is less likely to affect our differencein-differences estimates where the same individuals are followed over time (ie, an individual has the same sex in the pre-test period as in the post-test period). Composition might, however, also matter in our study as a result of censoring (ie, when a participant's healthcare use can no longer be observed). Adjusting might also improve precision. 18 We thus adjusted for several individual potential confounders: sex (male or female participants), number of comorbidities (0, 1, 2, or \u22653) based on risk conditions for severe covid-19 defined by an expert panel and as identified in data from the Norwegian Patient Register, 20 country of birth (Norway or elsewhere), and calendar month (12 categories, to account for seasonal variations in testing and healthcare use).",

The length of increased primary care use depended on age. Preschool aged participants (1-5 years) showed a longer increased use of primary healthcare services (~3-6 months) than 6-19 year olds (~1-3 months). By including all children and adolescents tested and not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway, our study provides a detailed picture of the post-covid healthcare use for the different age groups. Using routinely collected registry data and applying modern regression techniques, we found that the main effect of covid-19 on healthcare use in children and adolescents aged 1-19 years is likely limited to an increased use of primary care dependent on age. The findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection does not lead to severe long term health problems in children and adolescents, at least not problems that require follow-up by specialist care. These findings are important in the consideration of whether or not to vaccinate children and adolescents against SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether measures to control the virus are still required when adults have been vaccinated.",

More specifically, and when compared with children with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result, the relative increase in primary care use in the youngest age group (1-5 years) at 9-12 weeks after a positive test result was four times the relative increase in primary care use in the oldest age group (16-19 years) in the same period (table 3) . Also, 1-5 year olds represented the only age group with a long term (13-~24 weeks) increase in primary care use (table 3) . The trend towards younger children showing a longer impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection were confirmed in our analyses using an age interaction model and count outcomes or models (supplementary file parts B and C), however, was less evident in analyses using untested children as the comparison group (table 4, supplementary file parts B and C). Our findings therefore suggest that after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, 1-5 year olds have an increased use of primary care for 3-6 months, 6-15 year olds for three months, and 16-19 year olds for 1-3 months. For all age groups, the increase was mainly related to respiratory symptoms (fig 3, fig 4, supplementary S- Figure A2) . Because the youngest patients may experience more long lasting symptoms after other respiratory infections, 22 the prolonged increase in primary healthcare use due to respiratory conditions may be expected. However, considering previous reports that SARS-CoV-2 infection might lead to both short term and long term problems in a wide range of body systems (eg, digestive, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal) in adults, 1 14 23 the findings of limited impact on other systems than the respiratory system in children is important new knowledge, for example, for general practitioners, who will deal with most of the children with post-covid problems.",

Our supplementary study shows that such children do not access healthcare more than children with covid-19 who were not admitted to hospital (supplementary file part D). These findings should be interpreted with care, however, given that the number of participants admitted to hospital was low, and the appropriateness of the comparison group (children with a positive doi: 10.1136/bmj-2021-066809 | BMJ 2022;376:e066809 | the bmj SARS-CoV-2 test result not admitted to hospital can be questioned as the children might be recovered enough by discharge to not require further healthcare). Probably a more important research question in the future will be how health after covid-19 compares with that after influenza, particularly among children who are admitted to hospital. We were unable to estimate this in our study because of a zero prevalence of influenza-like illnesses in Norway during 2021. 24 Influenza viruses will, however, probably start to recirculate along the fewer public health measures taken and along the higher vaccination coverage in the adult population, enabling such a study design in the future. Finally, important topics for further study will be the post-covid health of infants (0-1 years, not included here because of excess healthcare use during birth and throughout the maternity period) as well as the identification of what characterises children who are in need of prolonged healthcare after covid-19 (eg, studying the joint effects of country of birth, socioeconomic status, and number and type of comorbidities using a prediction or classification model).",

Another strength is the use of routinely collected data from registers that are mandated by law and cover the entire population of Norway. Our methodological approach of studying healthcare use both before and after the week of testing for SARS-CoV-2 is also a major strength. This approach allowed us to form a detailed picture of what happens to children and adolescents after covid-19, independent of time invariant confounders. Because factors such as the underlying transmission in society, testing patterns over time, including the increased testing during our study period (see fig 1) and healthcare use, as well as public health measures will impact on all three study groups to the same extent, these factors will be adjusted for by design. Such important strengths ensure the representativeness of our study and that our findings might be used to inform actions to control SARS-CoV-2 in Norway and comparable countries. One limitation is that healthcare use cannot always be used as a proxy for a population's health or medical conditions. Rather, it may be used as a marker for healthcare seeking behaviour. Thus, symptoms could persist that are not dealt with in primary or specialist care.",

For example, parents might decide that their 2 year old child should be tested based only on non-verbal information, whereas teenagers to a larger extent might book a test using their own initiative. Although recommendations for testing have included all people with symptoms, parents might be more likely to test their children with pre-existing conditions and younger children, rather than their healthy and older children (a negative test result was a requirement for several healthcare activities including hospital visits). These issues could result in different selection criteria for age groups in those who tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. We used three measures to circumvent this selection issue of those participants at risk or in need of healthcare being tested more often. Firstly, to increase the representativeness of our study we randomly assigned the untested population-presumably a generally healthy groupto a hypothetical test date. Secondly, we excluded all children and adolescents who had an inpatient or outpatient hospital stay during the test week or the 1-2 weeks after the test week, since such people might be tested because of seeking medical treatment. Excluding these individuals ensures that the group who tested negative is more similar for pre-test and posttest healthcare use to the group who tested positive. Thirdly, we only studied children and adolescents who were tested after 1 August 2020, when testing was widely available for all population groups (not only healthcare workers and those deemed to be at risk).",

            "text": "The selection criteria could have led to an underestimation of the effect of covid-19 in the analyses that compared participants with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result versus those with a negative result, because young people who require a test are more likely to be tested owing to poor pre-existing health, such that the participants who tested negative might be less healthy than the optimal comparison group. However, we may have overestimated the effect of covid-19 in the analyses that compared participants positive for SARS-CoV-2 with untested controls, because untested children and adolescents might be healthier than the optimal comparison group. The true effect of SARS-CoV-2 on post-covid healthcare use may therefore be somewhere between the estimates from the two comparison groups. We therefore believe that the measures taken to combat selection for PCR testing, and the similar findings across two different comparison groups-one possibly healthier (untested) than the one with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and one similarly healthy (negative for SARS-CoV-2), as well as across different age groups-strengthen the validity and representativeness of our findings. In that regard, our findings can be generalisable to countries with equal and free access to healthcare and PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 for all the inhabitants. Our findings, however, will not be representative for countries that largely rely on home testing or antigen testing, as both these were almost not performed in Norway in our study period. Finally, we cannot be certain that the temporal pattern in healthcare use of children and adolescents without covid-19 or those who were untested are reasonable counterfactuals for the patterns in healthcare use of the children and adolescents with covid-19. However, the similar trends in healthcare use in the months before the test week ( fig 2) accord with the common trend assumption of the difference-in-differences method. 19 Conclusion Covid-19 among children and adolescents has a limited impact on healthcare services. Preschool aged children might take longer to recover (~3-6 months) than primary or secondary school students (~1-3 months), usually because of respiratory conditions. The limited impact of covid-19 on the health of young people is important information in the consideration of whether children and adolescents should be vaccinated to protect themselves and others.",
