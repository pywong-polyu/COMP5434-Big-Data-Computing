In addition to virology research, mathematical models and simulations can be a valuable contribution to the understanding of the dynamics of the pandemic and can give recommendations to both physicians and politicians. In this paper we give an overview about mathematical models to describe the pandemic by differential equations. As a matter of principle the historic origin of the epidemic growth models will be remembered. Moreover we discuss models for the actual pandemic of 2020/2021. This will be done based on actual data of people infected with COVID-19 from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), input parameters of mathematical models will be determined and applied. These parameters will be estimated for the UK, Italy, Spain, and Germany and used in a SIR-type model. As a basis for the model's calibration, the initial exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the named countries is used. Strategies for the commencing and ending of social and economic shutdown measures are discussed. To respect heterogeneity of the people density in the different federal states of Germany diffusion effects are considered.",

In Germany, it is possible to control or trace the history of people with COVID-19 by local health institutions K Modeling of COVID-19 propagation with compartment models if the seven-day incidence has a value less than 50. However, between the end of December 2020 and the beginning of January 2021, the averaged incidence was about 140 and, in some hotspot federal states, such as Saxony, it was greater than 300. At the end of March 2020 and at the beginning of April 2020, the incidences changed dramatically. However, in general, one considers a different pandemic development from one federal state to another and this situation needs to be respected with the consideration of diffusion phenomena. If the social and economical life should be sustained, there are several possibilities of transmitting the COVID-19 virus. Among others, the following ones to be mentioned are: commuters and employees on the way to their office or to their position of employment, especially medical and nursing staff; pupils and teachers in schools and on the way to school; people buying everyday necessities using shopping centers; postmen, suppliers and deliverers.",

Let us assume the velocity N v spanning 50 to 100 km/day, which is a gauge of mobility [1, 7] . Another suggesting heuristic is given with the assumption of D assumed to be proportional to the population. The first ansatz, based on Eq. (39) , was applied in the simulations with N v D 100 km/day. However, these approaches looks to be a coarse approximation of such diffusion processes. As soon as the population (areas and number of inhabitants) of the federal states of Germany are different, D is expected to be a location-dependent non-constant function. This means that the diffusion phenomenon is supposed to be of a different intensity in the different federal states of Germany. The data given in Table 3 define the function D.

It is known that people in Schleswig-Holstein are exemplary with respect to the recommendations to avoid infection with the COVID-19 virus which means q < 0. On the other hand, in certain regions of Germany, people did not follow the indicated protocols, which means q > 0 existed for a long time (the government of Saxony has since changed the policy leading to q < 0).

On the other hand, a small-scale process occurs with the direct virus transmission via epidemiological infection. This process can be described with a SIR model, for example. The change of s per day can be divided into a part coming from diffusion and another part coming from the local transmission of the virus. The second issue will be modeled with the SIR model. The local virus transmission means, in other words,Fig. 20 Comparison of real data [14] and simulation results",
