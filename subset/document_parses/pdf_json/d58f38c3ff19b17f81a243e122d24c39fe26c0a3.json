The availability of both therapeutic and prophylactic agents with proven efficacy are still urgently needed. IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) prevent viral attachment and entry into human cells by blocking attachment to the ACE2 receptor. However, since several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs), that emerged late 2020, have been associated with increased transmissibility or immune evasion, it is of particular importance to evaluate the effectiveness of mAb against these variants. In particular, substitutions E484K and K417N in S have been associated with immune escape, or increased binding to the ACE-2 receptor (e.g., N501Y) [1] .",

So far, studies have been conducted with artificial pseudoviruses indicating that B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma) and P.2 (Zeta) variants are expected to be resistant to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, these variants have been proposed to be partially resistant to neutralization by convalescent sera obtained from COVID-19 patient as well as by vaccine-elicted sera obtained from individuals after immunization with BNT2b2 or mRNA1273. However, since in real world settings additional substitutions that might determine replication efficiency define each VoC, there is still lacking evidence that these artificially performed studies can also be transferred to authentic viruses. Hence, in this study we analysed the ability of bamlanivimab, casirivimab, and imdevimab to neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.2 (Zeta) in infectious cell culture. Additionally, we analyzed vaccine-elicited sera after immunization with BNT162b2 and mRNA1273, and convalescent sera for their ability to neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

            "text": "To determine the neutralisation efficiency of convalescence and vaccine-elicited sera, SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were quantified (table 1) slightly lower compared to preceding viral isolates, however, the neutralisation sensitivity of variant B.1.351 was shown to be significantly reduced [8] . Our in vitro findings using authentic SARS-CoV-2 confirms that, in contrast to vaccine-elicited sera, bamlanivimab and casirivimab may not provide efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.351 (Beta) and P.2 (Zeta) both harboring the E484K substitution. Since imdevimab was able to efficiently neutralize both variants, therapeutical treatment with the REGN-COV-2 combination is unrestricted effective. In agreement, previous studies using artificial pseudoviruses described that LY-CoV555 and REGN10933 are ineffective against B.1.351 (Beta) but is still effective against B.1.1.7 (Alpha) [7, 9] . This and previous work revealed a lower neutralizing activity against E484K harboring variants B1.351 (Beta) and P.2 (Zeta), which may facilitate re-infection with emerging variants [8, 10, 11] . Amino acid substitutions hinders spike proteins to be bound by antibodies, resulting in reduced protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection [12]. Hence, a higher antibody titer is needed, which might be provided by a second vaccination dose inducing the formation of a critical amount of neutralizing antibodies [13, 14] . Even a single immunization already increased the neutralising titers of convalescents, although with reduced efficiency for B.1.351 (beta) [8] . Of note, immune response after vaccination also includes a broad T cell repertoire, which might be effective despite resistance to antibody A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 mediated immunity [15] . Hence, viral escape of T cell immunity is unlikely. However, whether this also applicable for tested and future SARS-CoV-2 variants has to be further investigated.",

Hence, a broader analysis with more isolates should be expanded in future studies. We tested convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera (mRNA1273 and BNT162b2) for their neutralisation efficiency, however, the number of sera was relatively small and most of these convalescence sera originate from individuals infected with non-VOCs. In future, it would be also interesting to study sera from individuals infected with VOCs and thus with corresponding antibodies. In addition, sera from individuals vaccinated with vector vaccines and heterologously vaccinated should be included.",

The mAb working solutions,convalescence sera, or sera from BNT162b2 and mRNA1273 vaccinated individuals were serially diluted 1:2 and incubated with 4000 TCID 50 / ml of each SARS-CoV-2 isolate, and subjected to cell based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. The corresponding sample dilution resulting in 50% virus neutralization titer (NT 50 ) was determined. After 3 days of incubation cells were evaluated for the presence of a cytopathic effect (CPE). All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed and approved by the Ethik-Kommission des Fachbereiches Medizin der Goethe Universitaet Frankfurt (250719). All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived. Results: The variant B.1.1.7 (Alpha), as well as B and B.1 isolates from early 2020 (FFM1 and FFM7), could be efficiently neutralized by bamlanivimab, casirivimab, and imdevinab (titer 1/1280, respectively) (figure 1a). However, using bamlanivimab, no neutralization effect could be detected against either B.1.351 (Beta) or P.2 (Zeta), both harboring the E484K substitution. Spike protein alignments confirmed that only E484K substitution occurs exclusively in the two strains that could not be neutralized by bamlanivimab (GeneBank accession numbers: MW822592 (B.1.351; FFM-ZAF1/2021) and MW822593 (P.2; FFM-BRA1/2021)). Imdevimab binding outside the ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD), was able to neutralize the virus without decline in efficiency. However, for casirivimab a severe drop in neutralization capacity was observed for B.1.351 (Beta) (titer 1/20), and a considerably reduction in the neutralization capacity against P.2 (Zeta) (titer 1/320) (figure 1a). These data shows that B.1.351 exerts a 1000-fold reduction of SARS-CoV-2",

Comparable to SARS-CoV-2 variants from early 2020 (B and B.1), convalescence (figure 1b, figure S1a) and BNT162b2 or mRNA1273 vaccine-elicited sera, respectively, (figure 1c, figure S1b) efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (Alpha). A moderate but significant decrease (average of all vaccine-elicited sera: 1.27-fold) in the neutralisation efficiency of sera from vaccinated individuals was observed for SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (Alpha) compared to SARS-CoV-2 B (p=0.021). Compared to B.1 (FFM7), a slightly higher neutralisation efficiency (0.54-fold) could be observed (p=0.025). All tested sera were significantly less efficient against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 (Beta) and P.2 (Zeta) (figure 1b-c, figure S1). Testing of convalescent sera revealed a 6.27-6.74-fold lower neutralizing activity against B1.351 (Beta) and a 5.09-fold lower activity against P.2 (Zeta) when compared the variants from early 2020 (figure 1a, figure S1a). Serum samples of vaccinated individuals were on average 4.35-fold and 2.67-fold (B and B.1, respectively) less effective against variant B.1.351 (Beta) and 2.84-fold and 2.86-fold (B and B.1, respectively) less effective against variant P.2 (Zeta). Considering the antibody titers the efficacy of both mRNA1273 and BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited sera was comparable in our study. In one serum obtained from an individual who was vaccinated after convalescence (#21) a loss of neutralisation efficiency was observed despite high antibody concentrations (table1).",
