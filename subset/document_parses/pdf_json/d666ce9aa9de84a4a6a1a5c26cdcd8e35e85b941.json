Inpatient psychiatric units face unique challenges, as patients cannot be isolated in their rooms and are at times unable to practice social distancing measures. Many institutions have experimented with providing some psychiatric services remotely to reduce the number of people physically present on the wards and decrease the risk of disease transmission. This case report presents 2 patient perspectives on receiving psychiatric care via videoconferencing while on the inpatient unit of a large academic tertiary care hospital. One patient identified some benefits to virtual treatment while the second found the experience impersonal; both were satisfied with the overall quality of care they received and were stable 2 weeks after discharge. These cases demonstrate that effective care can be provided remotely even to severely ill psychiatric patients who require hospitalization.",

Many institutions are now experimenting with new virtual mental health care delivery models (4) . However, there are far less data regarding implementation (5) or patient satisfaction (6) when telepsychiatry is utilized on inpatient units. The American Psychiatric Association has lamented the lack of broader adoption of telepsychiatry services for inpatient treatment (7); the coronavirus pandemic has made broader adoption of this method of mental health care delivery a safety necessity.",

She had recently been hospitalized at another psychiatric facility for 7 days, but within 24 hours of discharge her symptoms returned. At the urging of her family, she presented to our hospital for further treatment. Over the course of admission, she was treated with risperidone, which was increased to 4 mg nightly, and clonazepam 0.5 mg, which was stopped prior to discharge. With these medication changes, Ms D's sleep normalized and her paranoia and delusions resolved. Although her thought process became linear, she continued to have deficits in abstract thinking and had difficulty appreciating the nature of her illness. Her diagnosis was amended to schizoaffective disorder as she had experienced delusions for more than 2 weeks in the absence of a prominent mood episode. She was discharged home with plans to enroll in a virtual intensive outpatient program.",

Neither experienced setbacks during hospitalization, indicating that virtual follow-up did not adversely impact their treatment. Although these cases support the hypothesis that telepsychiatry can be safely utilized in this setting, our results should be interpreted with caution. Ms D's symptoms had markedly improved prior to the transition and we likely would not have attempted to use videoconferencing during her initial evaluation when she was more floridly psychotic. When patients were disorganized, agitated, and aggressive, psychiatric evaluations were still performed in person. Both patients found virtual visits acceptable in part because they continued to have positive face-to-face interactions with nurses who remained on the inpatient unit; without highquality in-person nursing care, the results may have been different. Finally, the data presented are from 2 patients; many more cases will need to be reported before drawing firm conclusions.",
