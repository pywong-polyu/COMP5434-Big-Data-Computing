Then within the SIR framework we study the susceptible-infecteddeceased (SID) correlations. All models reproduce well the number of infected cases and give similar predictions. What causes us deep concern is the large number of deaths projected by the SI and SID models. Our analysis shows that, irrespective of the possible uncertainty of our model prediction, the next few days can be critical for determining the future evolution of the death cases.",

We deem it is of special importance to study the COVID-19 spreading in Sweden where, unlike other countries, the government is taking a rather relaxed strategy with no massive testing on suspected individuals and no strict lockdown in her most affected regions.",
