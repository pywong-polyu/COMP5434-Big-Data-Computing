Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of NAFLD, is likely to become the leading cause of cirrhosis and etiology for liver transplantation in future decades in the Western World. Most patients with NAFLD have some components of metabolic syndrome, including obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. NAFLD encompasses a wide spectrum of liver damage, ranging from simple steatosis to NASH, that can progress to advanced liver disease, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma. Unfortunately, the options for the pharmacological treatment of NASH are still very limited. Nonetheless, several classes of therapies have shown promise, and are currently being evaluated in large phase 2b and phase 3 trials, creating some hope that selected agents will be approved in the coming years. As NASH is a heterogeneous disease, multiple mechanistic pathways are being targeted to achieve optimal treatment response. Combination therapy is also on the horizon, where 2 or more drugs targeting different mechanistic pathways are being used to boost the clinical response. In this review, we first present the current concept of the pathophysiology of NASH, focusing on the pathways currently targeted in clinical trials. We then present the pharmacological agents that are being evaluated in phase IIb of clinical development and beyond, using histological outcomes, and finally we present preliminary results from the combination trials that have already been initiated.",

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of NAFLD, is one of the top indications for liver transplantation in the United States [2]. On the other hand, the global obesity epidemic is also on the rise, as well as obesity-related complications (NAFLD, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea) [3] [4] [5] . Most patients with NAFLD have components of metabolic syndrome (MS), including obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Cardiovascular mortality is the most common cause of death among patients with NAFLD and NASH [1, 6, 7] . Furthermore, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at the greatest risk for NAFLD and NASH, with a global prevalence rate of 58% and 65%, respectively [3]. However, NAFLD and NASH can also occur in the absence of obesity in about 10-20% of Americans and Europeans. In Asian populations the prevalence of NAFLD in non-obese patients varies significantly across different countries and is estimated to range from 4-75% (4% in Taiwan, 22% in Japan, 21% in China, 30% in Korea and 75% in India) [8] .",

Currently, there is no approved drug for the treatment of NASH.

Several ongoing clinical trials are currently testing new molecules for NASH therapy [11] . Clinical research is likely to identify new targets for therapy and may further explore combination therapy to target synergistic pathways. Additionally, the drugs that have failed in phase III trials (for example elafibranor, cenicriviroc, and selonsertib) contribute to the trajectory of further research. The main challenges in the design of clinical trials on NASH include the complex pathophysiology of the disease, the heterogeneous population enrolled in the studies and the high degree of variability in assessing histological endpoints.",

Insulin resistance, another key pathogenic driver of NAFLD, is a shared characteristic of T2DM and obesity that may also contribute to the increased levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) and carbohydrates seen in patients with NASH [12] . Manipulation of fatty acid metabolism through different pathogenetic pathways may contribute to the inhibition of the natural course of NAFLD [13] . Finally, genetic susceptibility, alcohol consumption and dysbiosis may also play a role in NAFLD progression and NASH development [12] . The main mechanisms that contribute to the disease spectrum of NAFLD, along with the pharmacological agents that target them, are summarized in Fig. 1 and presented in more detail below.",

Multiple types of lipids are involved in the development of hepatic lipotoxicity. Lipids with increased levels in patients with NASH are FFAs, triglycerides (TGs), free cholesterol, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), bile acids, and ceramides. However, not all lipids are harmful.

Both genetic and epigenetic factors are thought to contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in NASH [17] . Once FFA flux is increased, the mitochondria become exhausted and FFAs are handled in other sites, including peroxisomes (\u03b2-oxidation) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (\u03c9-oxidation), leading to oxidative stress and cell death [18] . The ER is a major site for calcium storage, carbohydrate metabolism, protein synthesis and folding, and lipid and steroid synthesis [19] . Any imbalance in these processes or saturation of the ER membrane with lipids can lead to ER stress, apoptosis and cell death [20] .",

In addition, an open-label part has been now added in selected sites that are less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this part of the study, 150 subjects will be randomized into 3 groups according to the post-baseline (72 weeks) biopsy. The objective of the open-label part is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of b.i.d. administration of 300 mg of aramchol and to explore the kinetics of histological outcome measures and noninvasive tests associated with NASH and fibrosis for the treatment duration of at least 72 weeks and up to 120 weeks.",

The primary endpoint was a 2-point reduction in the activity part of the SAF score (combining inflammation and ballooning) without worsening of fibrosis; the key secondary endpoints were resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis and improvement of fibrosis without worsening of NASH [44] . The results showed that the primary endpoint was met with the 1200 mg dose (55% vs. 33%, P=0.007), but favored both doses (1200 and 800 mg) over placebo for resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis (49% and 39%, respectively, vs. 22%), improvement in fibrosis stage of at least 1 without worsening of NASH (48% and 34%, respectively, vs. 29%), and resolution of NASH plus improvement in fibrosis stage of at least 1 (35% and 25%, respectively, vs. 9%) [45] . The dropout rate for adverse events in this trial was less than 5% and was similar across the trial groups. However, diarrhea, nausea, peripheral edema, anemia, and weight gain occurred more frequently with lanifibranor than with placebo. The company has designed a phase III randomizedcontrolled study (the NATiV3 study; NCT04849728) that plans to recruit 2000 patients with NASH and fibrosis stage F2 or F3. Patients will be randomized to receive lanifibranor (800 mg/day), lanifibranor (1200 mg/day), or placebo, employing a 1:1:1 randomization scheme. Primary outcomes are the effects of lanifibranor compared to placebo on: i) NASH resolution and improvement of fibrosis assessed by liver histology at 72 weeks; and ii) delaying NASH disease progression measured by a composite endpoint that includes progression to cirrhosis, liverrelated clinical outcome events, or all-cause death.",

Galectin inhibitors are a new class of drugs that target galectins and disrupt their functions [68] . Chalassani et al performed a phase IIb randomized, double-blind study of the galectin-3 inhibitor belapectin in adults with cirrhosis and portal hypertension secondary to NASH [69] .

However, in subgroup analysis, patients without varices receiving 2 mg/kg belapectin (n=81) experienced a reduction in HVPG (-1.61 mmHg) compared with placebo (P=0.02). Adverse events were similar across all arms and there were no differences in complications of cirrhosis between groups. Based on the findings from the phase IIb trial, the drug is currently being evaluated in an adaptive, 2-stage phase II/III trial in patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices at baseline (the NAVIGATE trial; NCT04365868).

A significant percentage of patients (74%) had a >30% decrease in liver fat, as determined by MRI-PDFF, and serum ALT and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase were significantly improved.

In a total of 392 treated patients (56% had compensated cirrhosis), a \u22651-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH after 48 weeks of treatment was numerically higher in all combination groups. Furthermore, the combination of cilofexor plus firsocostat led to statistically significant decreases of \u22652 points in NAS score, serum ALT and serum-based noninvasive fibrosis markers, compared with placebo.
