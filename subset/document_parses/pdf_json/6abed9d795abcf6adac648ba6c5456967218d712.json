            "text": "The categorical integrated plastic surgery residency match is one of the most competitive specialties within the National Resident Matching Program. Applicants routinely have high USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK scores, numerous research experiences and publications, and membership in the Alpha Omega Alpha honor society. 1 A prior study evaluating the residency application process from the perspective of program directors (PDs) identified performance on away/subinternship rotations and interviews as the two most important factors in selecting residents. 2 To increase their chances of matching, many integrated applicants participate in multiple away rotations to both make a good impression and determine whether the program is a \"good fit.\" 3 Following the conversion to a pass/fail system on USMLE Step 1, a survey of integrated plastic surgery PDs showed that applicant familiarity was the most important factor for selecting an applicant to interview. 4 In the months leading up to the 2020-2021 residency application cycle, however, many institutions suspended sub-internship rotations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, hindering both applicants' and PDs' abilities to establish familiarity and determine \"fit.\" 5 Interviews took place via a virtual format in the 2020-2021 application cycle as a result of the Coronavirus Disease Benjamin A.

Janis, MD* Background: Interviews for the integrated plastic surgery residency match took place in a virtual format for the 2020-2021 application cycle. Current literature lacks the perspectives of program directors (PDs) on virtual interviews compared with traditional in-person interviews. Methods: Following institutional review board approval, an anonymous 17-question survey was distributed by email to 82 program directors of integrated plastic surgery residency programs in the United States. Participants were asked baseline program information, the number of positions and interview invites offered, and their perspectives on various aspects of the virtual interview process. Results: Sixty-two (75.6%) PDs completed the survey. Thirty-seven percent reported increasing the number of interview offers per available residency spot. On a five-point Likert scale (1, not well at all; 5, extremely well), PDs showed no significant differences in their ability judge an applicant's professionalism (3.1 \u00b1 1.1), interpersonal and communication skills (3.2 \u00b1 1.1), and \"fit\" with their program (2.9 \u00b1 0.9) during virtual interviews (P = 0.360). Sixty-eight percent reported being satisfied (15.3% extremely satisfied, 52.5% somewhat satisfied) with the virtual interview process, though 76.3% preferred in-person interviews. Conclusions: This study is the first to provide insight into PDs' impressions of virtual residency interviews. Although most reported being satisfied with the virtual interview process, the majority still preferred in-person interviews. Further longterm studies evaluating the pros and cons of each interview modality may provide more information on whether virtual interviews could become a sustainable alternative to the traditional in-person residency interview. 19) pandemic, which further changed the integrated plastic surgery residency landscape. 6, 7 Virtual or web-based interviews are not new to the 2020-2021 residency application cycle and have been studied previously, but definitive data on whether the virtual interview process is a suitable and equitable substitute for in-person interviews is lacking. [8] [9] [10] Prior studies have examined the advantages and disadvantages of each format as they relate to the plastic surgery residency process, but whether one or the other is superior remains undetermined. 11 Due to the widespread unfamiliarity of virtual interviews in the residency application process, current perspectives on this process, as it compares to in-person interviews in plastic surgery, are unknown. We sought to assess the perspectives of integrated plastic surgery PDs following the 2020-2021 application cycle to better characterize the potential role of this interview modality in future application cycles.",

In an openresponse text box at the end of our survey, PDs had the option to add any additional information they wished to share. Three PDs suggested a cap on the number of interviews each applicant can accept to help combat \"interview hoarding.\" Supporting this point, an analysis of the independent plastic surgery match suggests that many competitive applicants attended more interviews than needed. 19 However, no integrated plastic surgery program went unfilled in the 2021 match. 20 Further investigation is required, given the uncertainty of the effects of potential \"interview hoarding\" on match results from the applicant and PD standpoint.",

Though 75.6% of program directors responded, the anonymity of the survey responses and limited demographic information eliminated the opportunity to perform a nonresponder analysis. Additionally, the survey was deployed after the completion of the 2020-2021 application cycle. As a result, the amount of time each program director had between their respective interview day(s) and completing the survey varied and was not quantified. The survey referenced only integrated interviews and not independent interviews, which limits generalizability.",
