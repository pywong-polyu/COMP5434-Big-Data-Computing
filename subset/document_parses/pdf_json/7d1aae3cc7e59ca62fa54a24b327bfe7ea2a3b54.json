It is of utmost importance to assess the risks of contamination of susceptible people by infectious individuals and to evaluate the level of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses transmission in the community. Most countries have imposed non-pharmaceutical measures to contain SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including physical distancing and mask wearing. Here we evaluated the spreading of viruses in open air using harmless Escherichia coli bacteriophages as a surrogate. Phages were sprayed towards Petri dishes seeded with bacteria at different lengths and angles. Our results showed that the transmission rate decreased exponentially with distance. The highest recorded transmission rate was 9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 PFU/plate when phages were sprayed from a 1 m distance, suggesting that the probability of transmission of a single virus at a 1 m distance is 1:100,000.",

            "text": "The current COVID-19 pandemic has renewed the discussion about the mechanisms through which respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 spread and contaminate susceptible people. It is widely believed that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through droplets transmitted by infected people. These droplets, often released via coughing, sneezing or by regular breathing or talking (Riediker and Tsai 2020) , can be broadly classified into large ( > 5 \u03bcm in diameter) and small droplets ( \u2243 5 \u03bcm in diameter) ( Bar-On et al. 2020) . Large droplets fall rapidly to the ground or to the nearest flat surface, while small droplets can remain airborne for an extended period of time (Wang et al. 2020 ). SARS-CoV-2 diameter is about 100 nm, the diameter of a droplet nuclei produced by coughing is about ten times larger, but it should be noted that expelled respiratory viruses are usually contained in even larger droplets (Yang et al. 2007 ). The mean size of droplets produced by sneezing and regular speech varies substantially and it is in the range of ten to hundreds of micrometers (Han et al. 2013 ). Viral transmission can occur by touching the nose or mouth mucosae with hands that have got previously in contact with surfaces contaminated by large droplets. Indeed, influenza control policies were based on the premise that most respiratory infections are transmitted by large respiratory droplets (Fennelly 2020) . However, several studies have shown that humans produce infectious influenza droplets containing both aerosols (small particles) and larger droplets (Bischoff et al. 2013; Fabian et al. 2008; Lindsley et al. 2010 ). The situation with SARS-CoV-2 is less certain, but it seems that COVID-19 propagates both via airborne and droplet transmission (Domingo et al. 2020; Morawska and Cao 2020; Tang et al. 2020; Wilson et al. 2020) . While contamination by large droplets should be directly proportional to the proximity to the index subject (Brankston et al. 2007) , airborne transmission which occurs via small nuclei droplets in infectious aerosols has a much further reach. In confined spaces and particularly in superspreading events, such as choir rehearsals (Hamner 2020) and prisons (Wallace 2020) During the COVID-19 pandemic governments and health agencies have been recommending or imposing different measures aiming at reducing virus transmission. Among them the requirement of physical distancing and the use of face masks. These distancing measures varied from country to country, from a recommendation to maintain 1-2 m distance among each other to strict home confinement. The 1-2 m distancing recommendation (WHO 2020) was based on the idea that virus transmission occurs via large droplets, as proximity to the index case was mainly associated with higher transmission (Fennelly 2020) . Different countries adopted distinct approaches regarding face masks, while a few countries have not recommended mask wearing at all, others have made face masks mandatory in all public spaces, indoors and outdoors, and some only in confined spaces such as public transportation and shops. As of January 2021, only a handful of countries do not recommend the use of masks under any circumstance, while most required the use of masks at least in places where physical distancing is not possible (masks4all 2020). In the most extreme cases, mask wearing was required everywhere, even outdoors in sparsely crowded spaces, such as parks and beaches. In some countries, only certain states or provinces require the use of masks as is the case of Australia, Brazil and the United States. In the state of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, citizens older than 3-years old are required to wear masks in all public spaces, including in open air, under the threat of heavy fines (ALESP 2020). Currently, the WHO recommends the use of face masks in settings where it is not possible to maintain a distance of at least 1 m from others (WHO 2020).",

            "text": "In principle, mask wearing by infected individuals may prevent the spread of viruses via large droplets, but only well fit respirators may offer protection from inhalation of infectious aerosols (Gawn et al. 2008 ). Nevertheless, randomised controlled trials in community settings have shown moderate to null protective effect of surgical masks or respirators on the transmission of respiratory viruses (Aiello et al. 2010 (Aiello et al. , 2012 Bundgaard et al. 2020; Cowling et al. 2009; Larson et al. 2010; MacIntyre et al. 2009; Simmerman et al. 2011; Suess et al. 2012) . Interestingly, there are no studies that evaluated the benefits of mask wearing outdoors. Here we evaluated the spreading of viruses in open air using Escherichia coli bacteriophages as a surrogate for human respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza. and other bacterial phages are similar in size to SARS-CoV-2 and have been used extensively in many fields of biology research, including as models for the study of airborne and not airborne eukaryotic viruses (Black et al. 2010; Kormuth et al. 2018; Turgeon et al. 2014) . In addition, they are easy to manipulate and are entirely harmless to humans and to the environment, an important pre-condition to perform experiments outside the laboratory walls. A set of experiments were conducted to test the effect of distance and movement relative to the infectious source in open settings.",

Figure 1A -C illustrates the several experimental settings that were conducted, all performed in open air. With the exception of one experiment, in which the plates were positioned on the floor facing upwards (Fig. 1C) , in all experimental sets the plates were handled upright (mimicking the position and angle of a human face), roughly 160 cm above ground and kept opened for 60 s following the spraying of phages. In these experiments, \u223c 10 5 PFU were sprayed each time from a bottled containing a phage concentration of \u223c 5 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/ml. Overall, phage plaques were observed in 42 out of 258 plates. The PFU/plate concentration obtained in each experiment is depicted in Fig. 2A . The highest PFU count was observed in 3 plates that were placed at 1 m distance face up on the floor (299, 234 and 154 PFU), in one plate positioned at a 1 m distance 45\u00b0 to the left (236 PFU) and in one plate placed at 1 m in front of the phage sprayer (93 PFU). However, even at the shortest distance (1 m) the majority of plates (63 out of 86) displayed Fig. 1 Experimental settings of virus spreading. A trigger sprayer containing \u223c 1.5 \u22c5 10 5 PFU/ml of phages was used to spray top-agar plates freshly seeded with \u223c 5 \u22c5 10 8 susceptible E. coli bacteria. Each spray ( 0.7 ml) contained approximately 10 5 phages. A Phages were sprayed towards plates positioned at the same height but at different horizontal arrangements: Front, Back, 45\u00b0 to the left and 45\u00b0 to the right. In each situation, the plates were positioned at 1, 2 or 3 m away from the phage source (sprayer). Plates lids were removed and the plates were held vertically for 1 min following the spray shot. B immediately following the spraying event lidless plates held vertically at 1, 2 or 3 m from the phage source were circularly moved at walking pace either clockwise or anti-clockwise. C Phages were sprayed towards open plates at the floor at 1, 2 or 3 m away. D Approximatelly 2,500 PFU were sprayed each time towards open plates held vertically at 10-100 cm away from the phage source no plaques at all. Table S1 shows the PFU in each plate that did present plaques. Most plates that were placed in front of the sprayer at a 1 m distance (9 out of 12) developed at least one plaque, while 2 m distance, only one plate (out of 12) with a single plaque was observed. No plaques were found in plates distant 3 m from the sprayer. Under all other arrangements back, right, left, clockwise or anti-clockwise movement, only the minority of plates presented plaques and at low numbers. One exception was a plate placed at 45\u00b0 left at 1 m distance, which displayed 236 PFU. It is worth noticing that in some cases the droplets were carried by a wind gust of up to 21 Km/h blown at the precise time of spraying. The occurrence of these wind gusts might explain the high number of plaques in some plates and the presence of PFUs in plates placed at distances larger than 1 m. In the absence of wind (most plates placed more than 1 m away) recorded no plaques.",

The highest transmission rate -9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 was, as expected, observed in plates directly sprayed with phages from the short distance of 1 m. Under the other experimental conditions the transmission rate went from 0 to 5.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 /plate. In principle, the transmission rate should have been directly proportional to the distance from the phage source, but this was not always the case. For instance, spraying from a 1 m or 3 m distance in the opposite direction of the plates ('Back' in Table 1 ) resulted in a null transmission rate, but at a 2 m distance, the transmission rate was 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 .

In addition, in open air the extent of dilution is orders of magnitude higher than 10,000 times. Thus, unlike a non-ventilated confined space where small virus particles accumulate in the air for an indefinite amount of time or until reaching a flat surface, in the outdoors these airborne particles simply disperse or get diluted. In addition, emitted small droplets are normally warmer than the surrounding environment and tend to move upwards getting further diluted in the air. Accordingly, it has been shown that outdoor air in residential and urban areas was mostly devoid of SARS-CoV-2 particles in both northern and southern Italy during the peak of the pandemic in May 2020 (Chirizzi et al. 2020) .",

A typical virus emitter coughs 250 ml of 0.277 virus particles/cm 3 (Riediker and Tsai 2020), i.e., 69.25 copies of virus per cough. While a single cough releases \u223c3,000 droplets, sneezing might produce an estimate of 40,000 droplets (Cole and Cook 1998) . However, no reliable estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infectious particles released by sneezing could be found. Each phage spraying event emitted \u223c 0.7 ml, containing approximately 10 5 active phages. This number is thus about 1,444 times higher than the average number of SARS-CoV-2 particles released in a single cough by a typical emitter. The precise infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, but it is believed to be closer to that of SARS and lower than that for MERS -requiring something between 500 and 50,000 PFU (Ryan et al. 2021) . The phage dispersion experiments showed the maximal transmission rate of 9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , which indicates that only 1 in \u223c 100, 000 phage particles are able to reach the plate at a 1 m distance. At larger distances the transmission rate was even lower. In our setting a spray at a 1 m distance resembles a sneeze, cough or speech directed towards the face of a nearby individual. In that case, our results suggest that an infectious individual coughing or sneezing should shed 10 7 virus particles in order to infect a susceptible person at a 1 m distance with a minimal infectious dose of 100 virus particles, provided that the coughing/sneezing is an one-time event in open air or in an well-ventilated space.",

In terms of size, the circular SARS-CoV-2 has a diameter of 100 nm, while the phage has an icosahedral head with about 60 nm in diameter, and a non-contractile tail with about 150 nm in length (Furth et al. 1983; Hendrix and Casjens 2005) . Given their similar dimensions both types of particles should be contained in similar droplet sizes (small and large) and follow thus comparable spreading paths. The median diameter size of the droplets produced by our sprayer was 127 \u03bc m, which is compatible with sneeze and speech droplets size but larger than that of cough particles (Han et al. 2013) . A droplet diameter of 127 \u03bc m corresponds to a volume of 0.001 \u03bc l. Given that the phage concentration in the sprinkler was 150,000 phages/ml, each droplet should carry about 0.15 phages, i.e., roughly only 1 in every 6 droplets contained a phage particle.

Aerosols, in particular, consist of very small particles ( < 5 \u03bcm ) that can in the absence of air currents or ventilation remain airborne for extended periods of time (Fennelly 2020) . However, in open air, these small droplets tend to dilute immediately as already pointed out. The ones that may be the cause of concern in the open air are the high-velocity larger droplets produced by sneeze and those emitted by regular speech. Here we showed that this type of infectious droplets are able to infect an open Petri dish with a 9 cm diameter (area = 64 cm 2 ) at a 1 m distance at the low rate of 10 \u22125 . At a 2 m distance the transmission rate drops even further. It should be noticed that the exposed area in a Petri dish is considerably larger than the total mucosal area in a human face.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we presented here a simplified test for the dispersion of viruses in open air. For obvious reasons, such an experiment could not be performed with live human viruses outside the laboratory, but by using a bacterial virus that is completely innocuous to all living beings, except for a narrow range of E. coli strains, harmless to the environment and that resembles in size respiratory viruses it was possible to evaluate the pattern of outdoors transmission. Our results suggest that virus transmission at a 1 m distance, i.e. not very crowded open air settings, such as streets and parks or in well-ventilated sites has a very small likelihood. Therefore, the use of face masks or any other protective shield outdoors is not required as long as a minimal distance of 1 m is kept among each other, as already recommended by the WHO and adopted by many countries (WHO 2020; masks4all 2020). Fig. 2 A Distribution of PFU on plates sprayed with 10 5 phages. Plates freshly seeded with E. coli cells were sprayed with phages as described in Fig. 1A -C. Each time droplets containing approximately 10 5 phages were released through the nozzle of a trigger sprayer. The plates containing the bacteria were kept open for 60 s following the spray and incubated overnight. On the next day the phage plaques were counted. The legend at the right describes the position of the plates relative to the phage sprayer. A1, A2 and A3 represent plates positioned at 1 m, 2 m and 3 m in front of the sprayer, respectively; B1, B2 and B3 represent plates positioned at the rear of the sprayer (at a 180 \u2022 angle); C1, C2 and C3 represent plates positioned at the left with a 45 \u2022 angle from the sprayer nozzle; D1, D2 and D3 is as above except that the plates were positioned at the right; E1, E2 and E3 represent plates moving from one side of the sprayer to the other making a 180 \u2022 arch in a clockwise direction; F1, F2 and F3 is the same as above except that the plates were moved in an anticlockwise direction. Finally, G1, G2 and G3 represent plates placed on the floor face up. With the exception of the G1, G2 and G3 setting, in all other experiments the plates were kept open in an upright position. In all cases, 1, 2 and 3 respectively represent 1 m, 2 m and 3 m distance between the sprayer and the open plate. B. PFU number in plates exposed to phage spraying at a 40-100 cm range. phages were sprayed towards plates seeded with E. coli from a spray bottle containing an average of 3,575 PFU/ml.
