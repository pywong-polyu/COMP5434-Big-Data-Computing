During the course of a viral infection, host cells release exosomes and other extracellular vesicles carrying viral and host components that can modulate the immune response. The present study used a shotgun proteomic approach to map the host circulating exosomes' response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated how SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates exosome content, exosomes' involvement in disease progression, and the potential use of plasma exosomes as biomarkers of disease severity. A proteomic analysis of patient-derived exosomes identified several molecules involved in the immune response, inflammation, and activation of the coagulation and complement pathways, which are the main mechanisms of COVID-19-associated tissue damage and multiple organ dysfunctions. In addition, several potential biomarkers-such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, complement C1r subcomponent and serum amyloid P-component-were shown to have a diagnostic feature presenting an area under the curve (AUC) of almost 1. Proteins correlating with disease severity were also detected. Moreover, for the first time, we identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the exosomal cargo, which suggests that the virus might use the endocytosis route to spread infection. Our findings indicate circulating exosomes' significant contribution to several processes-such as inflammation, coagulation, and immunomodulation-during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study's data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD021144.",

The disease's clinical presentation following infection is challenging, ranging from asymptomatic patients or mild-to-moderate respiratory infections in individuals with atypical pneumonia. Peculiar features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) require admission to intensive care units and mechanical ventilation. Although respiratory failure is the most common clinical presentation of severe COVID-19 cases, dysfunctions of other organs-including the kidneys and heart-have also been reported . The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect multiple cell types, including lung epithelial cells, lymphocytes, and other types of leukocytes subsets (Bost et al., 2020) . Moreover, Varga et al., (2020) demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 could enter the endothelial cells of several organs; notably, endothelial infection is responsible for viral dissemination and triggering of the coagulation and complement cascades, which are key elements in the host's thromboinflammatory response and the development of multiple organ failures (Guglielmetti et al., 2020; Noris et al., 2020) . In our previous work we used a comprehensive untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic approach to capture the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing evidence that lipids and metabolic dysfunction are strongly involved in COVID-19 (Barberis et al.,2020) .",

In this scenario, extracellular vesicles (EVs) may represent an important tool for COVID-19 management. EVs are micro-particles released from different types of activated cells, and they play a key role in the mechanisms of intercellular crosstalk through the direct transfer to target cells of proteins, receptors, lipids, organelles, and genetic materials such as mRNA and microRNA. EVs are present in different body fluids-including plasma, urine, saliva, and liquor-increasingly offering an opportunity to apply OMIC technologies in order to study the host response to viral infections and for biomarker discovery. Proteomics technology has been widely used to characterize and study EVs (Bandu et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2020; Adamo et al., 2019; Bonafede et al., 2019) . EVs can be classified into three main families: 1) exosomes that originate from multivesicular bodies, ranging in size from 30 to 150 nm; 2) microvesicles or shedding vesicles released by cells through a membrane-sorting process promoted by enzymes such as flippase, floppase, and scramblase and characterized by a size larger than exosomes (150-1,000 nm); and 3) apoptotic bodies that are larger than exosomes and microvesicles and that are released by cells undergoing programmed cell death (Camussi et al., 2013) .",

A total of 157 proteins were modulated in exosomes from critical COVID-19 patients compared to healthy subjects, while 97 proteins were regulated in non-critical patients (p-value < 0.05, fold change > 1.3). Volcano plots ( Figure 5A and Figure 5B ) showed the most significant differences among proteins and the positive or negative fold-changes in exosomes from critical and non-critical COVID-19 patients compared to the healthy group. To summarize the univariate results, we used a heat map ( Figure 5C ) to display the fold changes of the top modulated proteins. This heat map allowed visualization of the three clusters of samples and different protein levels. The complete list of modulated proteins is reported in Supplementary Tables S1, S2. The top regulated proteins in both critical and non-critical patients, compared to healthy subjects, mainly included inflammatory, immune-response, and coagulation proteins. In critical patients, C-reactive protein (122-fold), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (38-fold), lysozyme C (13-fold), titin (12-fold), and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (12fold) were up-regulated while putative trypsin-6 (31-fold), coiled-coil domain-containing protein 34 (18-fold), C4bbinding protein alpha chain (18-fold), C4b-binding protein beta chain (15-fold), and pre-mRNA-processing factor 19 (14-fold) were down-regulated. Among non-critical COVID-19 patients, the top five up-regulated proteins were haptoglobin (41-fold), C-reactive protein (40-fold), trypsin-3 (14-fold), adenomatous polyposis coli protein (11-fold), and hyaluronan-binding protein 2 (10-fold) while immunoglobulin kappa variables 1-5 (10-fold), immunoglobulin heavy variables 3-64D (7-fold), fibrinogen gamma chain (5-fold), C4b-binding protein alpha chain (5fold), and C4b-binding protein beta chain (5-fold) were under-expressed.",

The canonical pathways involved in the host response mainly related to immune response, inflammation, and coagulation. The chord diagrams in Figure 6A ,B report the top 10 pathways and their relative proteins involved in critical (6A) and non-critical (6B) patients. The main pathways involved in non-critical and critical patients were the complement system pathway, acute-phase response signaling, the coagulation system, the LXR/RXR activation pathway, the extrinsic and intrinsic prothrombin activation pathway, the FXR/RXR activation pathway, IL-12 signaling and production in macrophages, the production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis signaling. As Figure 6C shows, some pathways were more altered in noncritical patients-specifically, acute phase response signaling, LXR/ RXR, and FXR/RXR activation. Meanwhile, other pathways-such as the complement system, the coagulation system, and the extrinsic and intrinsic prothrombin activation pathway-were more altered in critical patients.",

Participating patients were enrolled from a hospital located in Northern Italy, the first western epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. WBC, neutrophil, and eosinophil counts were increased in critical COVID-19 patients while the number of red blood cells, as well as lymphocytes, were significantly decreased (Terpos et al., 2020) . Exosomes and EVs play significant roles in various biological functions and, particularly, in both physiological and pathological processes (Zhang et al., 2019) . Indeed, they are associated with immune responses, viral pathogenicity, pregnancy, cardiovascular diseases, central nervous system-related diseases, and cancer progression (Kalluri and LeBleu, 2020) .Several examples of scientific evidence have shown that viruses might use EVs to enter uninfected cells (Urbanelli et al., 2019) . During the course of infections, EVs can convey pathogen molecules that serve as antigens or agonists of innate immune receptors to induce host defense and immunity or serve as regulators of host defense and mediators of immune evasion (Kadiu et al., 2012; Schorey and Harding, 2016) .Our data reports, for the first time, the presence of viral material in COVID-19 patients' host exosomal cargo. This finding suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may use the endocytosis route to spread infection throughout the host. We did not identify viral proteins via the purification of exosomes; thus, we can conclude that viral particles were not purified together with exosomes, suggesting that the RNA material was originally present in the cargo. A very recent study showed that exosomal microRNAs may drive thrombosis in COVID-19 patients (Gambardella et al., 2020) while Song and colleagues found that GM3-enriched exosomes positively correlated with disease severity, suggesting that they may participate in the pathological processes associated with COVID-19 progression (Song et al., 2020) . Moreover, exosome-based strategies were also proposed to treat COVID-19 (Hassanpour et al., 2020) or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection (Cocozza et al., 2020) .",

The complement pathway is a double-edged sword for our immune system: it may offer protection by favoring viral clearance, but unrestrained activation may also result in pathological acute and chronic inflammations, tissue injury, and activation of the coagulation pathway (Noris et al., 2020) . Complement activation has been linked to the pathophysiology of ARDS caused by various underlying diseases, and it has also been associated with COVID-19 (Risitano et al., 2020) . Chahar et al. demonstrated that exosomes derived from respiratory syncytial virus-infected cells were able to activate an innate immune response by inducing cytokine and chemokine release from human monocytes and airway epithelial cells (Chahar et al., 2018) . As Figure 6A ,B show, we found a dysregulation of 17 proteins (C1QB, C1QC, C1R, C1S, C2, C3, C4A/C4B, C4BPA, C4BPB, C5, C6, C8A, C8G, CFI, CR1, MBL2, SERPING1) in critical patients associated with the complement system pathway while, in non-critical patients, 11 proteins were modulated (C1R, C4A/C4B, C4BPA, C4BPB, C8A, C8G, C9, CFH, CFI, MBL2, and SERPING1). In addition, the complement system pathway appeared more altered in critical patients (-log (p-value) 27.6) than non-critical patients (-log (p-value) 17.7). Among complement-related proteins, CFH and C4BPA had already been identified as transcriptional markers associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection: these molecules play central roles in complement activation and innate immunity (Ramlall et al., 2020) . Moreover, we found an 2.5-fold increase of C9 in non-critical patients and a down-regulation of CFH; these findings suggest that, in critical COVID-19 patients, the C9 complement component might be impaired due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as has already been shown for the hepatitis C virus (Kim et al., 2013) . Interestingly, a global down-regulation of proteins coding for antibodies such as IGHV1-2, IGHV3-15, IGHV3-23, IGHV3-9, IGHV4-28, IGHV4-38-2, IGKV1-5, and IGKV4-1 was especially found in critical COVID-19 patients, suggesting the involvement of the humoral immune response, as Rolla et al. (2020) have already shown in reporting a significantly lower count of antibody-synthesizing lymphocyte among critical COVID-19 patients. Our results provide the first evidence of circulating exosomes' potential immunomodulatory contribution in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The acute-phase response is an innate body defense activated during acute illnesses, and it involves increased production of acute-phase proteins such as CRP and cytokines. In the case of an infection, the inflammatory response stimulates the liver to synthesize and release anti-inflammatory proteins that suppress inflammation and regulate immunity in the body (Gelain and Bonsembiante, 2019). As already reported, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients show high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung involvement; such inflammation has also been observed in SARS and MERS patients (Coperchini et al., 2020) .",

Moreover, serum changes in acute-phase response proteins were used as indicators to identify the degree and progression of COVID-19. A significant increase in CRP and SAA content and a decrease C3 and C4 content have been associated with the disease's severity (Li and Chen, 2020) . In our study, among acute-phase proteins, exosomal CRP resulted in 122-fold and 40-fold up-regulation in critical and non-critical patients, respectively. A preliminary analysis of hematological and inflammatory parameters was associated with elevated CRP, IL-6, and NLR values and with worse outcomes as well as a lack of response to treatment (Montesarchio et al., 2020; Khinda et al., 2020) . High C-reactive protein independently predicted the risk of mortality in a cohort of 183 COVID-19 patients (Rolla et al., 2020) . Another study identified increased CRP levels in a limited number (31.0%) of COVID-19 patients (Ren et al., 2020) . While high CRP levels were already reported during inflammation processes, our results indicate that CRP can be transported to other cells through EVs, thus driving the infection's inflammatory effect. Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein protein (AGP), which is one of the major acute-phase proteins in humans, was up-regulated in both critical and non-critical patients. During the acute-phase response, the serum concentration of AGP increases as a liver hepatocytes response to the cytokines that are released by monocytes and other cells in the early phase of inflammation or infection (van Dijk et al., 1991) . Alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (AACT_HUMAN) is another acute-phase protein that was found to be overexpressed in critical COVID-19 patients. IL-12 signaling and production in macrophages pathways were significantly altered in both critical and non-critical patients, although we did not identify IL-12 protein directly in exosome cargo. Experimental evidence has shown that IL-12 rapidly activates both innate and specific immune responses, promoting host cellular responses, the clearance of the virus, and host recovery from infection (Komastu et al., 1998) .",

Indeed, ACE2 physiologically binds and cleaves Lysdes-Arg9-Bradykinin and Des-Arg9 Bradykinin, which are potent ligands of Bradykynin Receptor 1 in the lungs (van de Veerdonk et al., 2020) . When the virus blocks ACE2, the degradation of bradykinin cannot be performed, causing the accumulation of bradykinin itself; consequently, bradykinin-a product of high-molecular-weight kininogen-binds to its receptor (bradikynin-1receptor), triggering acute inflammation in the lungs due to the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines such as the well-known IL-6 (Colarusso et al., 2020) . Moreover, the kallikrein/kinin and renin-angiotensin systems also play a thrombo-regulatory role (Fang and Schmaier, 2020) . Our data showed a two-fold up-regulation of Kininogen-1 in the exosomes of COVID-19 patients. Kininogen-1 itself has a relationship with the coagulation cascade, and it is considered an anti-thrombotic target. Indeed, its gene deletion has been associated with a reduced risk of induced thrombosis in mice (Fang and Schmaier, 2020) . Hemostatic and thrombotic manifestations are common in critical COVID-19 patients, and they are among the leading causes of death (Al-Samkari et al., 2020 52), while a high number of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events among severely ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia has been observed worldwide (Fontana et al., 2020) . Relying on the role of Kininogen-1 and our findings, we speculate that exosomes may serve as a reserve and carrier of Kininogen-1.",

            "text": "Bioinformatic analysis has also pointed out the IL-6 and TGF\u03b21 cytokines' involvement as upstream regulators of modulated protein. IL-6 is recognized as the main mediator of the inflammatory and immune response initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Grifoni et al., 2020) . As an upstream regulator of the exosomal proteins in COVID-19 patients, we speculate that IL-6 may also affect protein secretion from cells through EVs. TGF\u03b21 is a pleiotropic cytokine with regulatory capabilities, and it is involved in the resolution of the inflammatory response (Sanjabi et al., 2009) . The host response to infection could be regulated by TGF\u03b21 with the help of a cytokine storm and the presence of TNF, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 (Chen, 2020). Lung fibrosis is among the clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 infection; indeed it was identified as a leading cause of pulmonary damage, as reported by Polak et al., (2020) , who showed that 22% of patients presented a fibrotic pattern of lung injury characterized by interstitial fibrosis. Our data also suggest a correlation between TGF\u03b21, glucose, and exosomes. Interestingly, a correlation between a high concentration of glucose and worsening COVID-19 has been reported; for example, diabetic patients with uncontrolled glucose levels are evidently more prone to manifesting COVID-19 complications and consequent increased mortality-though the molecular mechanism currently remains undetermined (Zhu et al., 2020) . Prolonged and uncontrolled hyperglycemia was also described as a prognostic factor (Brufsky, 2020) . Most importantly, exosomes' key role was already reported in the pathogenesis of diabetes nephropathy: high glucose leads to increased excretion of exosomes from macrophages through the TGF-\u03b21 mRNA, which acts as a bridge between macrophages and mesangial cells (Zhu et al., 2019) . A similar connection might also be applied to COVID-19, between macrophages and lung cells, even if other research is needed to investigate this hypothesis. We also investigated exosomal proteins' potential role as diagnostic biomarkers for COVID-19 infection and disease severity. Several exosomal proteins such as CRP, A1AG1, A1AG2, CXCL7, SAMP, and ZA2G proteins directly correlated with the disease's severity, as their increase among critical patients showed, by suggesting a potential use of these proteins for monitoring the disease's outcome and, potentially, any response to therapies. In line with our hypothesis, the exosomal proteome was already investigated to monitor sepsis progression (Xu et al., 2018) and HIV patients subjected to antiretroviral therapy (Chettimada et al., 2018) . Huan et al. found that COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, suggesting that SAA could serve as a biomarker to monitor the respiratory diseases' progression (Huan et al., 2020) . CRP levels positively correlated with the diameter of lung lesions and severe presentation (Wang, 2020; Matsumoto et al., 2019) but also with an increased risk of organ failure and death (Pierrakos and Vincent, 2010) . Another interesting protein that we found to be up-regulated in critical patients is Fetuin-A. Exosomal Fetuin-A was already identified as a novel urinary biomarker for detecting acute kidney injury. We speculate that its up-regulation in critical COVID-19 patients can explain kidney injury, which is often reported in severe patients (Zhou et al., 2006) .",

Proteomic analysis of plasma exosomes identified several molecules involved in immune response, inflammation, and the activation of coagulation and complement pathways, suggesting a significant role for exosomes in the mechanisms associated with tissue damage and multiple organ dysfunctions typical of COVID-19. Another remarkable result emerging from these data is the presence of several potential biomarkers that are well correlated with the disease's severity. Although, to date, ours is the first study that characterizes the circulating exosomal proteins and pathways from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, future studies are needed to determine the number and size of EVs in COVID-19. Moreover, monitoring exosomal content during infection may contribute to a better understanding of whether exosomes support viral spreading or induce immunological protection.",

The liquid chromatography parameters were as follows: analytical column Acclaim PepMap C18 2 \u03bcm 75\u00b5m x 150 mm and injection volume 2 \u03bcl. The flow rate was 300 nl/min, phase A was 0.1% formic acid/water and phase B was 80% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid/20% water. A two hours gradient was used (3-45%). For identification purposes the mass spectrometer analysis was performed using a mass range of 100-1600 Da (TOF scan with an accumulation time of 0.25 s), followed by a MS/MS product ion scan from 400 to 1250 Da (accumulation time of 5.0 ms) with the abundance threshold set at 30 cps (40 candidate ions can be monitored during every cycle). The ion source parameters in electrospray positive mode were set as follows: curtain gas (N2) at 30 psig, nebulizer gas GAS1 at 25 psig, ionspray floating voltage (ISFV) at 2700 V, source temperature at 90\u00b0C and declustering potential at 85 V. For label-free quantification, samples were then subjected to cyclic data independent analysis (DIA) of the mass spectra, using a 25-Da window. A 50 ms survey scan (TOF-MS) was performed, followed by MS/MS experiments on all precursors. These MS/MS experiments were performed in a cyclic manner using an accumulation time of 40 ms per 25-Da swath (36 swaths in total) for a total cycle time of 1.5408 s. The ions were fragmented for each MS/MS experiment in the collision cell using the rolling collision energy. The MS data were acquired with Analyst TF 1.7 (SCIEX, Concord, Canada).",
