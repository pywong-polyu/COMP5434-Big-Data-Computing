Living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has been mostly suspended and deceased-donor living transplantation activity has been considerably reduced because of coronavirus disease 2019 . We modified our protocols and procedures in line with COVID-19 guidelines. Since the restructuring, we have performed 20 LDLTs. Our study reports the outcomes of these cases and demonstrates the feasibility of LDLT during this pandemic. Materials and Methods. The changes were influenced by experiences and communications from across the globe. A month-long self-imposed moratorium was spent in restructuring the program and implementing new protocols. Twenty LDLTs were performed between April 18 and September 15 using the new protocols. Our experience includes 2 simultaneous liverkidney transplants, 1 ABO-incompatible LDLT, and 1 pediatric case (age 11 months). Results. Nineteen patients recovered and 1 patient died. We maintained our postoperative immunosuppression protocol without many changes. Major complications were observed in 30% of recipients but none of the donors. One recipient was infected with COVID-19 during the postoperative period. A donor-recipient couple contracted COVID-19 after discharge from the hospital. All patients recovered from COVID-19 and liver enzymes were unaffected. Conclusion. This study represents a microcosm of experience in LDLT during the COVID-19 era. Outcomes of LDLT are not affected by COVID-19 per se, provided that we make necessary changes.",

An overwhelmed system is not an ideal situation for LDLT and, understandable, LDLTs were suspended across the globe [1e6]. Patients with advanced or decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are at high risk and can became unsalvageable if deferred too long. Deceased-donor liver transplantation has always been minimal in India even before the pandemic, because of unavailability of donors. LDLTs cannot be deferred for too long given the high short-term mortality. At what point does a recipient's mortality risk weighing the risk to the donor (double equipoise). South Korea reported a case of a living donor testing positive after a liver donation [3] . There is no published series reporting on outcomes of LDLT during the COVID-19 crisis. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (2015) episodes, immunosuppression in the posttransplant period was not associated with mortality [7, 8] . However, it would be prudent to consider immunosuppressed patients at high risk from COVID-19 [9] . Posttransplant patients with COVID-19 on immunosuppression may harbour the virus and transmit to others for a longer period.",

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [11] recommends suspending LDLT during the pandemic, except for pediatric patients with acute liver failure. They have provided recommendations on various aspects of liver transplantation such as immunosuppression, intensive care unit (ICU) protocols, transplant rounds, referrals among others. The Liver Transplant Society of India [12] called for a moratorium on nonurgent transplants but did not elaborate on what constitutes an urgent case other than acute liver failure and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization [13, 14] , the apex organization for organ transplant in India, issued specific guidelines for nationwide transplant activity.",

The center has experienced a steady increase in the number of referrals from northern regions of India and from other countries. Before the pandemic, we performed a mean of 8 LDLTs per month. Since the announcement of a lockdown from March 25 to April 18, no liver transplants have been performed. Our hospital is a private institution that operates on third-party payers such as government agencies and out-of-pocket expenditure. Insurance coverage is minimal across India and, even if available, covers only a fraction of the cost of LDLT. The bulk of COVID-19 cases in New Delhi were handled by large tertiary public hospitals and a few private institutions (our center was excluded) designated as COVID-19 centers. The remaining health care institutions were directed to carry on services per COVID-19 guidelines so that non-COVID-19 patients did not suffer for lack of services. As new cases of COVID-19 increased in Delhi, private institutions like ours were entrusted to make available up to 25% of bed capacity for the care of patients with COVID-19 beginning at the end of June (the area designated for patients with COVID-19 was strictly separated from areas for non-COVID patients, and there was no crossover of personnel in these areas). However, both the government organization (National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization) and professional bodies (Liver Transplant Society of India) recommended proceeding with urgent transplantation after careful evaluation on a case-by-case basis.",

We decided to limit our LDLTs to cases of acute liver failure/ACLF; with a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, Child C, HCC >2 cm; pediatric cases; and cases with recurrent, frequent decompensation with high expected mortality within next 3 months. The decision to proceed with transplant evaluation was taken after discussion among transplant hepatologist, transplant surgeons, and critical care teams on a case-by-case basis. A COVID-19 screening questionnaire similar to the one proposed by Kumar et al [17] concerning COVID-19 infection, exposure/travel history, and symptoms was administered. Any case suspected of COVID-19 was directed toward the \"suspected COVID\" pathway and transplant-related evaluation was deferred until the patient recovered or COVID-19 was ruled out. Donor and recipient nasopharyngeal samples underwent nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) twice before LDLT. Turnaround time for NAT tests is 6 to 12 hours depending on the daily case load at our institution. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected first thing in the morning and reporting was expedited so that we had the report by evening. The first testing was done at the initial visit in the OPD and the second was done 24 hours prior to LDLT. If the initial test was found to be positive, the patient was directed toward the COVID-19 pathway and no further transplant-related evaluation was done. The second test was done 24 hours prior to the transplant as per institutional protocol. If a patient tested positive for COVID-19 at any time, the transplant was deferred because COVID-19 positivity has poor postoperative outcomes [18] . Between the 2 tests, the patients were kept in home isolation as much as possible. Upon admission for LDLT, they were kept in isolated rooms and moved to the ICU once their NAT test was negative. Computed tomography of the chest was included while imaging the abdomen to ensure a low sensitivity for pulmonary complications. Person-to-person interaction was minimized, as was the time spent inside the hospital premises. The rest of transplant evaluation protocol was similar to that pre-COVID, with added preventive measures applicable to the COVID-19 crisis [19] . The entire transplant team including surgeons, anesthetists, critical care personnel, nursing staff, and technicians underwent NAT testing once during the lockdown period. Subsequently, liver transplant personnel were isolated and tested with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction if they had symptoms of COVID-19 or had close contact with a COVID-19positive patient. The experiences and communications from transplant centers across the globe helped us to formulate our own path and navigate this pandemic. In this study we chronicle the changes in our LDLT protocol and share our experience of 20 successful LDLTs under the new paradigm.",

The pandemic may take time to abate and may become much worse before it shows any trend toward improvement. Our own approach to LDLT has been a culmination of small adjustments and changes made along the way to navigate the pandemic. For a few weeks, no work was possible because we gauged the enormity of the situation and prepared for the impact. Soon, however, it became clear that the pandemic was not going to be of short duration. Hence, we worked to find ways to continue our work during the pandemic and during the post-COVID era. We assimilated experiences and approaches from across the globe and resumed LDLT.",

There was no impact on mean length of hospital stay or our ability to start immunosuppression. We disregarded length of ICU stay as a parameter because all of our patients (donors and recipients) were managed from admission to discharge in the ICU (because of the COVID-19 pandemic). We usually start tacrolimus toward the evening of first postoperative day, when a reasonable amount of stability is seen in the clinical condition. Nevertheless, we start with a low initial dose and a low threshold to withdraw the tacrolimus depending on the clinical condition. We were able to maintain our pre-COVID immunosuppression schedule of triple immunosuppression (calcineurin inhibitor \u00fe mycophenolate mofetil \u00fe steroids) in most of the patients. We did not modify our immunosuppression (including tacrolimus trough levels) or antibiotic policy from the pre-COVID-19 era. During the postoperative course, we did not perform universal COVID-19 testing but were guided by patient symptoms. Even those at high risk of COVID-19-related mortality (older patients with diabetes) had an uneventful recovery.",

This article presents the outcomes of 20 transplants performed during this period. In our experience, the COVID-19 pandemic itself does not have a bearing on the outcome of an uninfected LDLT recipient or donor, provided that necessary procedural and protocol modifications have been made. As the only reported series of LDLTs in COVID-19 across the globe, this study may bolster other programs to restart LDLTs. However, in regions where health care systems have been overwhelmed, it may be prudent to suspend LDLT activities.",
