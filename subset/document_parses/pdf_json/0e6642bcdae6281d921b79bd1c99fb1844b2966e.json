ClC-3 chloride channel/antiporter, encoded by the Clcn3, is critical for some basic cellular functions. Our previous work has shown significant alleviation of type 2 diabetes in Clcn3 knockout (Clcn3 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice. In the present study we investigated the role of Clcn3 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and ATM inflammation. To establish the mouse obesity model, both Clcn3 \u2212/\u2212 mice and wild-type mice were fed a HFD for 4 or 16 weeks. The metabolic parameters were assessed and the abdominal total adipose tissue was scanned using computed tomography. Their epididymal fat pad tissue and adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells were isolated for analyses. We found that the HFD-fed Clcn3 \u2212/\u2212 mice displayed a significant decrease in obesity-induced body weight gain and abdominal visceral fat accumulation as well as an improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism as compared with HFD-fed wild-type mice. Furthermore, the Clcn3 deficiency significantly attenuated HFD-induced ATM accumulation, HFD-increased F4/80 + CD11c + CD206 \u2212 SVF cells as well as HFD-activated TLR-4/NF-\u03baB signaling in epididymal fat tissue. In cultured human THP-1 macrophages, adenovirus-mediated transfer of Clcn3 specific shRNA inhibited, whereas adenovirus-mediated cDNA overexpression of Clcn3 enhanced lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and TLR-4. These results demonstrate a novel role for Clcn3 in HFD-induced obesity and ATM inflammation.",

            "text": "Obesity is mainly characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy (increase in fat cell size) and the accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) in humans and rodents, which induce chronic, low-grade inflammation, and insulin resistance (IR) [1] . In obese adipose tissue, ATMs undergo polarization from the M2 (anti-inflammatory) to M1 (pro-inflammatory) phenotype, which is considered a biomarker of macrophage-driven adipose tissue inflammation in IR, with elevated F4/80 + and CD11c + M1-like macrophages [2] . Hypertrophied adipocytes and immune cells, such as M1-like macrophages, shift the secretion of cytokines and adipokines toward the inflammatory profile (e.g., MCP-1 and IL-6) [3] , leading to the impairment of insulin sensitivity through activation of pro-inflammatory signaling, such as activation of TLR-4 and NF-\u03baB [4] . Furthermore, the depletion of CD11c + M1-like macrophages causes a marked reduction in pro-inflammatory macrophages in obese adipose tissue, which protects against obesity-associated IR [5] . However, the molecular details that underlie ATM-driven inflammatory responses within obese adipose tissue remain uncertain.",

As shown in Fig. 1a , b, the Clcn3 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased in eWAT from obese mice after the 4-week-HFD compared with those of the age-matched NC-fed groups (P < 0.05).

There was no difference in body weight between WT and KO mice fed the NC; moreover, there was no difference in the total calorie intake among all groups during the feeding period (Fig. 1c, d) . These results might exclude the influence from global Clcn3 knockout on eating behavior that may be due to the degeneration of hippocampal neurons where adipocyte derived leptin has binding sites [17] . Body weight in WT mice progressively increased from 4 weeks of administration of the HFD onwards, which was significantly decreased by Clcn3 deficiency from 6 weeks of administration of the HFD onwards (Fig. 1d) .

When ITT and PGTT were performed, KO-HFD mice had a smaller area under the curve (AUC) than their corresponding WT-HFD littermates, indicating that Clcn3 deficiency could improve glucose metabolism disorders and impair insulin sensitivity during HFD-induced obesity (Fig. 2c, d) .

As shown in Fig. 2e , the Western blotting data indicated that Clcn3 deficiency markedly increased the downregulation of phospho-IRS-1 (Ser307) in eWAT induced by the HFD, suggesting that Clcn3 may play a crucial role in regulating impaired insulin signaling during obesity. In addition, the loss of Clcn3 markedly decreased the HFD-induced elevation in the serum TG and FFA levels; however, there was no significant change in the HFD-induced total TC level (Table 1) . Taken together, these findings indicated that Clcn3 deficiency improved insulin sensitivity, glucose, and lipid metabolism in diet-induced obese mice.",

The transcript levels of the examined systemic cytokines and adipose tissue cytokines (or adipokines) were not significantly different between the WT-NC and KO-NC groups, indicating that Clcn3 deficiency had no influence on the basal production of these cytokines and chemokines in the absence of a dietary challenge (Fig. 5) . The serum of HFD-fed WT mice showed an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating the induction and progression of lowgrade adipose tissue inflammation. These changes were largely prevented in Clcn3 \u2212/\u2212 mice after the 16-week-HFD (Fig. 5a) . qRT-PCR analysis showed that Clcn3 deficiency significantly decreased the HFD-induced increase in mRNA expression of MCP-1, TLR-4, and IL-6 in eWAT (Fig. 5b-d) . Interestingly, Clcn3 deficiency significantly attenuated the HFD-induced increase in MCP-1 and TLR-4 as early as 4 weeks after HFD feeding, while it had no significant effects on the HFD-induced change in TNF-\u03b1 and adiponectin (Fig. 5e, f) . Tamoxifen at 10 \u00b5M has commonly been used to inhibit ClC-3-dependent Cl \u2212 currents and volumesensitive Cl \u2212 movement in many cell types, including RAW macrophages [20] . The qRT-PCR data demonstrated that tamoxifen causes a significant decrease in Clcn3 and inhibits the LPSinduced increase in MCP-1, TLR-4, and IL-6 in F4/80 + SVF cells isolated from mouse eWAT (Fig. S4) . These results support that the Clcn3-dependent Cl \u2212 currents may be involved in regulating ATM inflammation. Collectively, these findings indicated that the production of pro-inflammatory mediators induced by a HFD is lower locally and systemically in KO mice than in the corresponding WT mice, suggesting a decrease in the levels of adipose inflammation in KO mice during obesity.",

Notably, the 4week-HFD was shown to increase the mRNA and protein expressions of Clcn3 in adipose tissue, as well as several proinflammatory cytokines (such as MCP-1 and TLR-4) characteristic of adipose tissue inflammation, which could be significantly reduced in KO mice. These findings suggest that Clcn3 may be an early contributor to the development of obesity and obesity-related adipose tissue inflammation. Macrophage-related chronic inflammation has been implicated as a major pathogenic mechanism of adipose tissue dysfunction and consequent IR. Clcn3 deficiency has recently been reported to prevent atherosclerotic lesion development via suppressing the uptake of ox-LDL in macrophages [21] , directly linking Clcn3 to atherosclerotic lesion formation through the regulation of macrophage functions. Increased ATMs contribute to systemic IR by creating a pro-inflammatory environment. A HFD induces an increase in F4/80 + macrophage accumulation from both the recruitment of macrophages from the blood stream and the proliferation of itself, and it promotes the pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization within abdominal visceral fat and the secretion of pro-inflammatory adipokines. Accumulating evidence in obese mouse models has documented that the inhibition of M1 macrophage polarization is an effective strategy for attenuating adipose tissue inflammation and IR [5, 22] . Consistent with these reports, our present study provides direct evidence showing that Clcn3 may play an important role in obesity-associated chronic ATM inflammation because the loss of Clcn3 significantly reduced the HFD-induced increase in the cell numbers of ATMs and F4/ 80 + CD11c + CD206 \u2212 ATMs during obesity.",

In this study, we observed that the transcript levels of several key inflammatory cytokines (e.g., MCP-1 and IL-6) in eWAT were increased following HFD feeding in combination with a high serum CRP, thus confirming that adipose tissue serves as a primary source of inflammatory responses during obesity. The presented results demonstrated that upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 or downregulation of adiponectin induced by a HFD were not affected by Clcn3 deficiency. The result in Fig. S2 demonstrates that global Clcn3 deficiency did not affect HFD-induced injury to the mouse liver, suggesting that the influence of Clcn3 deficiency on obesity may be restricted to adipose tissue. Thus, it is likely that the effect of Clcn3 on the local transcript levels of different types of inflammatory cytokines is also limited. In addition, Clcn3 deficiency tended to increase the adiponectin mRNA expression after the 16week-HFD; however, there is no significant difference between the WT-HFD and KO-HFD groups. It has been found that there is an association between adipose tissue hypertrophy, a lower adiponectin level and aging [23] . Therefore, further investigation is required to examine the time-dependent influences of Clcn3 on age-related adipokine levels during obesity or type 2 diabetes. In addition, the expression of IL-6 was used to define adipose tissue inflammation. However, recent studies have demonstrated that a significant proportion of obese patients did not express typical inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [24] . Moreover, oncostatin M (OSM), a member of the IL-6 family, has been found to change the phenotypes of adipose tissue macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory M2 type. OSM may thus serve as a novel target for obesity and obesity-induced metabolic syndrome [25, 26] . Due to the increased complexity of obesity-related inflammatory cytokines indicated in adipose tissue, further investigation is required to evaluate the effects of Clcn3 deficiency on the inflammatory cytokine profile during obesity.",

Of note, Clcn3 deficiency significantly suppressed the HFD-induced increase in the TLR-4 mRNA and protein levels in eWAT at the early stage of obesity (after 4 weeks of the HFD), suggesting that Clcn3 may be a novel mechanism that underlies obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation through TLR-4 signaling. LPS is an important endogenous inflammatory mediator that underlies adipose tissue dysfunction during diet-induced obesity [28] . A HFD induces an increase in the level of LPS that could cause abdominal ATM-driven inflammation, thus contributing to the impaired glucose metabolism during obesity [29] . Consistent with these findings, we observed a significant increase in the serum CRP level accompanied by altered lipid metabolism in obese mice following feeding a HFD, which could be abolished by Clcn3 deficiency. LPS has been reported to promote the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines through the activation of TLR-4 and its downstream NF-\u03baB signaling in adipose tissue inflammation [30] . Recently, the knockdown of Clcn3 has been demonstrated to inhibit LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells by blocking the activation of TLR-4/NF-\u03baB signaling [31] . In agreement with these findings, we further demonstrated that Clcn3 deficiency remarkably suppressed the activation of TLR-4/NF-\u03baB in eWAT from obese mice following a HFD.

The data from our lab are in agreement with these previous reports and support that the Clcn3 gene may be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion [12] . With the exception of the rest insulin levels, our results indicated there were no abnormalities in the fasting glucose level, FFA and TG levels, glucose tolerance (PGTT), and insulin sensitivity (ITT and HOMA-IR) in global Clcn3 \u2212/\u2212 mice. These findings are consistent with a previous report that hyperglycemia or rebound hypoglycemia were not present following a glucose load in Clcn3 \u2212/\u2212 mice [34] . Apart from the pancreas, global Clcn3 \u2212/\u2212 mice show a degeneration of hippocampal neurons and an increase in the systemic leptin level [17] , which raise another concern regarding the neuronal influences on the eating behaviors of global Clcn3 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Our results demonstrated that there is no significant difference in the body weight between WT and KO mice fed the NC; moreover, there was no significant difference in the total calorie intake among all groups during the feeding period. These findings suggested that the improvement in HFD-induced glucose and lipid disorders in KO mice may not be due to the Clcn3 deficiency on pancreatic insulin secretion and eating behaviors, and there must be another mechanism involved in this process. Furthermore, our present data showed that Clcn3 deficiency significantly increased the down-regulation of the serine 307 Fig. 6 Clcn3 regulates LPS-induced activation of TLR-4/ NF-\u03baB in THP-1 macrophages. The effects of adenoviral Clcn3-shRNA knockdown (a) and Clcn3 overexpression (b) on protein expression of TLR-4 and phospho-NF-\u03baB p65/total NF-\u03baB p65 were detected by Western blotting. The respective control shRNA (Neg) and the adenoviral vector (Vector) without Clcn3 expression were employed. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, n = 6 independent experiments phosphorylation of IRS-1 induced by the HFD in eWAT, indicating that Clcn3 deficiency may recover the impaired insulin signaling. Similar beneficial effects of Clcn3 deficiency on disrupted glucose and lipid metabolism have been found in a high sucrose/fat, lowdose STZ induced T2DM mouse model [12] . Together, these findings raised the interesting possibility that Clcn3 might play a more general role in glucose and lipid metabolism disorders during the development of T2DM. Because the global Clcn3 knockout produces complex compensatory changes, further investigation in Clcn3 conditional knockout mouse models will be helpful to elucidate the role of Clcn3 in obesity and obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation and metabolic changes.",

            "text": "Volume-sensitive Cl \u2212 channels/currents have been reported to be crucial for adipocyte hypertrophy, \u03b2 cell excitability and inflammatory responses driven by immune cells and may thus be associated with adipose dysfunction [35, 36] . Clcn3 has been reported to encode the Cl \u2212 channel or regulate the volume-regulated Cl \u2212 movement or Cl \u2212 current in many cell types. The presented results from Clcn3 \u2212/\u2212 mice support the relation between an abnormal Cl \u2212 signal and adipose tissue dysfunction during obesity and T2DM. The inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on the LPS-induced increase in the transcript levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., MCP-1, TLR-4, and IL-6) in F4/80 + SVF cells isolated from mouse eWAT suggested a novel role of an abnormal Cl \u2212 signal in ATM inflammation. However, SWELL 1 (leucinerich repeats containing 8A, LRRC8A) has recently been reported to be an essential component of volume-regulated ion channels (VRACs) in adipocytes and \u03b2 cells, and may serve as an endogenous regulator of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis [35, [37] [38] [39] . In addition, bestrophin 1 is indispensable for volume regulation in human retinal pigment epithelium cells [40] . Therefore, the molecular identity for volume-sensitive Cl \u2212 channels remains controversial. The discrepancy regarding the Cl \u2212 channel molecular component in different cell types and distinct cell components within adipose tissue (e.g., adipocytes, preadipocytes, immune cells, and endothelial cells) suggests that the molecular components of volume-sensitive Cl \u2212 channels in adipose tissue should be complicated. Caution should be employed in investigating the relation between Clcn3 and Cl \u2212 signaling, particularly under pathological conditions. There may be limitations to the classification scheme of macrophages using CD11c because CD11c has also recently been found on adipose tissue dendritic cells (ATDCs) [41] . It has been reported that ATDCs may play a role in obesity-associated adipose inflammation [42, 43] . Therefore, our presented results could not exclude the influence of Clcn3 deficiency on ATDCs. Further investigation with specific macrophage markers, such as CD64, will be helpful to differentiate ATMs from ATDCs.",
