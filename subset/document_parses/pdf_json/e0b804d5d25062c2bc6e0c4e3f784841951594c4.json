Randomized clinical trials have shown mRNA-based vaccines to be 92-95% effective to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in persons 16 years of age or older [1, 2] . However, these trials were conducted under highly controlled conditions and included limited numbers of elderly subjects. Real-world studies are crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in the elderly population, which has been shown to be the population most vulnerable to COVID-19 and which may present a suboptimal immune response to vaccination due to the weakened immune system.",

To date, other studies reported estimation of high effectiveness (87-98%) of mRNA-based vaccines on severe-COVID-19 in fully vaccinated elderly people in the 1-6 months following vaccination [5] [6] [7] [8] , reporting the results with different age limits.
