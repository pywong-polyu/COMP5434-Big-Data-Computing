Complications from covid-19 range from mild to severe, with some people remaining relatively asymptomatic and others requiring hospital admission, intubation, and critical care. Although several successful treatments have been identified for patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, including dexamethasone, 1 heparin, 2 and tocilizumab, 3 treatment options for outpatients have lagged. Although combination monoclonal antibody therapy seems to decrease rates of medically attended visits in higher risk patients, 4 it is costly, not universally available, and, unlike oral and inhaled treatments, is complex to administer. Hence, the standard of outpatient care for most healthy adults remains supportive measures and quarantine. Nonetheless, infected patients can have a substantial symptom burden from cough and dyspnoea, and a subset might go on to require hospital admission. A safe, inexpensive treatment that can be administered at home and that reduces symptom burden and hospital admission is still urgently needed.",

In addition to its intrinsic antiinflammatory function, ciclesonide showed a potent antiviral effect when specifically screened for activity against SARS-CoV-2. 6 On the basis of in vitro data and the known anti-inflammatory effect of ciclesonide, we hypothesised that ciclesonide administered early in the course of covid-19 could decrease symptom burden in adults presenting with prominent respiratory symptoms.",

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either inhaled and intranasal ciclesonide or inhaled and intranasal placebo. Investigators, participants, and statisticians were blinded to treatment allocation. In the province of Quebec, recruitment occurred primarily through social media and by telephone contact of people who had tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 at the McGill University Health Centre. In Ontario, participants were recruited from a virtual covid-19 telehealth clinic at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. In British Columbia, one health authority provided access to its regional list of people who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and they were contacted and recruited by telephone. Participants were recruited province-wide from across Quebec, from the catchment area serviced by Sunnybrook Health Science Centre in Ontario and from the Vancouver Coastal Health region in British Columbia.",

A meeting with the data safety and monitoring board was held with 215 participants enrolled (203 in the modified intentionto-treat population) and without unblinding, as we noted that overall symptom resolution at day 7 was about 37% compared with the projected 65%. This was thought to be related to enrichment of participants with respiratory symptoms at enrolment. It was also noted that the STOIC trial (Inhaled Budesonide in the Treatment of Early COVID-19) had been reported and that budesonide was beginning to appear in provincial outpatient guidelines. Based on the drop off in newly diagnosed patients as we reached the summer months, and with the projected further increase in vaccination rates, we determined that we would be unable to recruit the intended sample size or to recruit to a larger sample size required to meet the intended effect size.

In a modified intention-to-treat analysis (n=139), the primary outcome occurred in 11 (15%) participants in the usual care group and two (3%) in the budesonide group (difference in proportions 0.12, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.21; P=0.009). Clinical recovery was also one day shorter in the budesonide group than usual care group (median 7 days (95% confidence interval 6 to 9 days) v 8 days (7 to 11 days); log rank test P=0.007). The lack of placebo and the lack of blinding of study nurses, however, might have led to bias in care seeking behaviour in the usual care arm.

Moreover, participants were enrolled early in the course of their disease (within an average of three days), which is probably similar to what is achievable in a real world setting when factoring in delays to seeking medical attention. Despite these strengths, our study has some limitations. We were unable to recruit the intended sample size given a rapid decline in cases of covid-19 in Canada following increases in vaccination. However, we recruited more participants than the STOIC trial, which found a difference in effect. In addition, we did not enrich the study population for older high risk people and cannot exclude a possible benefit in earlier symptom resolution and prevention of clinical deterioration in this group. That said, the overall rate of hospital admissions in our study was similar to those of other outpatient trials, 11 including one that enriched for higher risk participants. 16 We elected to examine the primary outcome at seven days after enrolment based on previous data that suggested up to 65% resolution over this timeframe. 11 Although the overall resolution of symptoms by day 7 after enrolment was lower than expected, no appreciable difference was found in the secondary outcome at day 14. It is important to mention that vaccinated participants were excluded from this trial. It was assumed vaccination would decrease the burden and duration of symptoms and risk of severe complications, which were our primary and secondary outcomes. It remains to be determined whether inhaled corticosteroids can reduce symptoms in vaccinated populations, but we expect that any observed effect would be smaller than in unvaccinated people.",
