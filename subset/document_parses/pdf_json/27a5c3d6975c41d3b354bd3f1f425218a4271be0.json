This is exemplified by international campaigns, such as Choosing Wisely and Do not Do prompts, which were launched to reduce unnecessary care in several medical services, resulting in less risks for the patients, saving costs and increasing value for care. 1 2 A parallel campaign initiative titled 'To Do or Not to Do?' was introduced to deimplement unnecessary care in the Netherlands. 3 Antimicrobial resistance, as a result of antibiotic overconsumption, is a global threat to public health, and there is global consensus about reducing the use of antibiotics. 4 Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common categories of infections for which antimicrobials are prescribed. 5 However, not all antimicrobial prescriptions are necessary. This is especially true for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), which is the presence of bacteria in the urine of a patient who does not have symptoms of a UTI. ASB is a common finding, especially among women, elderly and patients with urinary catheters. The prevalence of ASB Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba We will use a stepped-wedge cluster randomised design, ultimately resulting in implementation of our intervention in all participating hospitals. \u25ba Our strategy is well suited for broad-scale deimplementation in emergency departments. \u25ba A possible limitation of this study is that we are not able to evaluate the impact of an individual intervention since we are using a multifaceted deimplementation strategy. \u25ba Another possible limitation is that we are limited by documentation in the patient files, and therefore, we might overestimate the number of patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2017 showed a pooled prevalence of 45% among 4129 ASB cases (95% CI 39 to 50) who received inappropriate antimicrobial treatment. 8 The prevalence was even higher in a recent retrospective evaluation of 25 hospitals in the USA, in which 64% of the 2225 positive urine cultures were classified as ASB, and 72% of 961 patients with ASB were treated with antimicrobials. 9 The exact use of antimicrobials for ASB in hospitals in the Netherlands is unknown. However, in 2015, a prospective study performed in 10 nursing homes in the Netherlands showed that 115 (32%) of 356 residents with a possible UTI were treated inappropriately, and treatment of ASB was the most common reason. 10 These results indicate that reducing the treatment of ASB is an appropriate target of antimicrobial stewardship strategies.",

In 2005, a cluster randomised trial in 12 nursing homes in Canada and the USA showed a reduction in antimicrobial use after the multifaceted implementation of a diagnostic and treatment algorithm (1.17 vs 1.59 courses of antimicrobials/1000 resident days). 11 For catheterised patients in the USA, a controlled before-after study in 2015 showed a decrease of urine culture ordering from 41.2 to 23.3 per 1000 bed-days. 12 Furthermore, short educational sessions combined with feedback in two academic tertiary acute care hospitals in Canada, performed in 2015, resulted in a reduction of overtreatment for ASB of 8% (2 of 24 patients) in the intervention group compared with 52% (14 of 29 patients) in the control group (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.49). 13 In 2018, these findings resulted in the development of an implementation guide to reduce overtreatment of ASB. 14 However, effectiveness studies after the launch of this implementation guide have not yet been performed in emergency departments (EDs). The results of earlier studies suggest that improving ASB management in the ED is necessary. In 2017, a prospective observational study performed in the ED of a tertiary care centre in the USA showed that 27 of 71 (38%) older adults were not correctly diagnosed with a UTI. 15 Furthermore, overtreatment of a suspected (but unconfirmed) UTI was very common in a retrospective study performed in the ED of another tertiary care centre in the USA in 2013, where 63 of 66 (95%) patients were treated while they had a negative urine culture. 16 In this study, our aim was to reduce overtreatment of ASB by 50% by using a multifaceted deimplementation strategy based on the implementation guide described previously.",
