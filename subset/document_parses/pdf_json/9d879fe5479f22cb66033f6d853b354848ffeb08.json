This method generates large horizontal extensions, of complex ventilation in which diesel equipment is the most common. The method implies the installation of auxiliary fans in the faces, although it is still frequent to direct the air with line brattices. It shows two variants: the bidirectional or in W and the unidirectional or in U (McPherson 1993, p. 106) .

One of the main disadvantages of the U-system is that the air is loaded with toxic gases as it sweeps the faces, thereby decreasing its ability to renew the air. The W system, on the other hand, requires more line brattices to be executed and the pressure losses are greater. Another pillar-supported method is the sublevel stoping. In this method, the ventilation is achieved by injecting air through the production level 9 where the gases from the Load Haul Dump (LHD) diesel chargers accumulate (Fig. 5.10 As far as artificially supported methods are concerned, cut and fill and shrinkage stoping 10 are some of the most characteristic.",

Under this system, the air enters through the entry route to the face, sweeps it, and travels back through the return path to the general circulation (Fig. 5.14) . In addition, there is usually a purge system with its own fan which separates CH 4 from the previous circuit. A particularly up-to-date review of ventilation techniques in coal mining can be found in Gillies and Wu (2013) . From the point of view of ventilation, coal mines can be divided into sections or ventilating districts. These are independent ventilation units into which the mine is divided to avoid enrichment in noxious gases and dust, but above all, in firedamp. Their main function is to prevent ventilation air enrichment in the above-mentioned gases as a consequence of it crossing the stopes successively. Districts are considered as being independent when they have only the main inlet and outlet airways in common (e.g. MIE 1985) . By main airways, we refer to those galleries or shafts in which circulating air has not already passed through an active stope (Fig. 5.15 ). ",
