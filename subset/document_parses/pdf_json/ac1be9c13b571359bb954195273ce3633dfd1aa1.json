Younger children appear to be at greater risk than adults, yet helmet use is low despite this risk and legislation and ordinances requiring helmet use among younger riders. We sought to determine whether bicycle helmets are associated with the incidence and severity of head injury among pediatric bicyclists involved in a bicycle crash involving a motor vehicle. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients age \u2264 18 years hospitalized at a level I pediatric trauma center between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018. Data were abstracted from the institutional trauma registry and electronic medical record. International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th editions and external causes of injury codes were used to identify MV related bicycle crashes and determine the abbreviated injury severity (AIS) for head injury severity. Injury narratives were reviewed to determine helmet use. We calculated the incidence of head injury from bicycle vs. MV crashes utilizing descriptive statistics. We analyzed the risk and severity of injury utilizing univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Overall, 226 bicyclists were treated for injuries from being struck by a MV. The median age was 11 (interquartile range (IQR): 8 to 13) years. Helmeted bicyclists (n = 26, 27%) were younger (9.4 years versus 10.8 years, p = 0.04), and were less likely (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.49) to be diagnosed with a head injury compared to unhelmeted bicyclists (n = 199). Of those with a head injury, helmeted bicyclists were less likely (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.11-2.82) to sustain severe or higher injury using AIS. When adjusting for demographics (age, sex, race) and injury severity, helmet use predicted a reduction in head injury (OR 6.02, 95% CI 2.4-15.2). Conclusions: Bicycle helmet use was associated with reduced odds of head injury and severity of injury..

Of all childhood injuries, unintentional injuries have been reported as the leading cause of premature mortality (Rezendes 2006) . When looking at injuries associated with consumer products, bicycle-related injuries rank second as a cause of injury, behind only motor vehicles (MV) (United States Consumer Product Safety Commission n.d.). Bicycling continues to be a popular recreational activity and a mode of transportation for many children, which can carry considerable risk for injury based on those exposures. Riding in environments deemed unsafe has previously been shown to increase the risk of serious injury, particularly in motor vehicle collisions (MVC) (Rivara et al. 1997) . Further research claimed roughly 75% of all bicycle-related mortality is secondary to head injuries, and that 85% of those injuries could have been prevented by simply by wearing a bicycle helmet (Brainline: All about brain injury and PTSD n.d.). Younger children appear to be at greater risk of head injuries than adults, yet despite legislation and ordinances requiring helmet use among younger riders, helmet use has reportedly remained low (Schroeder and Wilbur 2013) . In theory, helmets would be inherently protective against head injury, and establishing the real-world effectiveness of helmets involved in MVC resulting in pediatric traumatic injuries is important. Previous reports found bicycle helmets more effective in single bicycle crashes than in collisions with motor vehicles (H\u00f8ye 2018) A Cochrane review of controlled studies evaluating the effect of bicycle helmets on injuries found helmets provide up to a 63-88% reduction in the risk of head, brain, and severe brain injury for cyclists of all ages (Thompson et al. 1999) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 168, "text": "(Butchart et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 284, "end": 299, "text": "(Rezendes 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 837, "end": 857, "text": "(Rivara et al. 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1304, "end": 1331, "text": "(Schroeder and Wilbur 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1882, "end": 1904, "text": "(Thompson et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "As those studies looked at all bicycle-related crashes, often involving a single bicyclist or a fall from a bicycle, as well as adult riders, it is difficult to determine how effective bicycle helmets are at reducing head injuries among children when involved in an MVC.

Wearing a helmet when riding a bike has been reported as the single most important safety device for decreasing a lower likelihood of head injury (Mehan et al. 2009 ). Despite helmet laws in 22 states and over 200 additional local laws, many of these injuries still occur while riding a bicycle but have the potential to be preventable through appropriate helmet use (Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute n.d.). Earlier evaluations summarized the protective effects of bicycle helmets on preventing injuries (providing up to a 63 to 88% reduction in the risk of head, brain, and severe brain injury), for bicyclists of all ages and all types of crashes (Thompson et al. 1999) . Our study sought to specifically select pediatric bicycle-related crashes with motor vehicles, theoretically representing the most energy transfer, or high impact collisions resulting in traumatic injury. We found similar benefits of helmet use when looking specifically at children involved in collision with motor vehicles. The results of our study support the use of strategies to increase the uptake of bicycle helmets as part of a comprehensive youth bicycling injury prevention program.
