The success rate of oxygen therapy is high, and the risk of developing complications is low. Fever, dyspnea, chest distress, respiratory rate, and albumin and globulin levels at admission are independent factors associated with the requirement of oxygen therapy. Our study showed that approximately 63% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients under 65 years old need oxygen therapy; however, the failure rate of oxygen therapy is below 10%, and the mortality rate is only 2.9% among oxygen therapy patients. Additionally, the length of hospitalization was longer in the oxygen therapy group. This finding is reasonable since those that required oxygen were much more severe. However, the difference in the length of hospitalization was only approximately 1.5 days. Thus, it is indicated that once oxygen therapy is administered in time, most young patients have a good clinical outcome. Thus, triaging patients who need oxygen therapy and administering oxygen therapy in time to avoid oxygen debt is very important to improve the clinical outcome. Moreover, the risk for COVID-19 patients under 65 years old to develop complications was very low. The most common complication in our study was liver impairment. Among our included patients, more than 90% received antivirals, more than half were administered antibiotics, and approximately 20% were treated with corticosteroids. All of these medicines cause liver impairment [15] . Furthermore, the hyperinflammation induced by COVID-19 could also damage liver function [16] . Dyspnea, chest distress and respiratory rate are independent factors associated with the requirement of oxygen therapy. All these symptoms were early signs of respiratory failure. Our study found that more patients had respiratory rates of more than 20 times/minute at admission in the oxygen therapy group (30.7% vs. 19.5%, p<0.001). Thus, respiratory rate and respiratory signs should be closely monitored. Moreover, low albumin and globulin levels were also independent risk factors. A similar result was also found in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) patients [17] . It is believed that albumin reflects the baseline nutritional status of patients and is linked to poor clinical outcome for hospitalized patients [18] . Good nutrition could support the body with immunity to clear the virus and promote disease recovery [19] . Moreover, serum globulin is generated by the immune system and liver. It plays a vital role in host protection against infection. In MERS patients, the levels of IgG and neutralizing antibodies were weakly and inversely correlated with lower respiratory tract viral loads [20] . A previous study found that the antibody titer was independently associated with the severity of COVID-19 [21] . Moreover, after receiving convalescent plasma therapy, the antibody level in COVID-19 patients increased significantly, and the viral load decreased [22] . This finding indicated that globulin also plays a vital role in clearing SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Moreover, our study found that fever is an independent factor associated with the requirement of oxygen therapy. However, the difference between the average body temperature in the two groups was actually very small. As mentioned in a previous study, fever might indicate a high risk of pulmonary function damage [23] . Additionally, fever was related to the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, which might contribute to cytokine storms [24] . In contrast, upregulation of the inflammatory reaction helps viral clearance [25] . Thus, it is difficult to judge whether fever is beneficial to patients. Studies have shown that the duration of fever is related to ICU admission [26] . We suppose that both the level of body temperature change and duration of fever should be taken into consideration. Significant differences were found in the levels of white blood cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils and the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes. However, after adjustment, none of them was an independent risk factor. It has been reported that the levels of white blood cells and lymphocytes do not remain constantly higher or lower than normal values; it is a dynamic process [27] . The levels would be normal at first, followed by decreasing to a nadir after approximately a week, then increasing to a peak in the second week, and then decreasing again. Lymphocyte levels also decrease first and then increase. Moreover, the whole process could be divided into a defense-based protective phase and a second inflammation-driven damaging phase [28] . Both phases could cause severe infection and hospitalization, although most people would experience only the first phase. However, we could not determine which phase patients were in when they were admitted to the hospital according to the blood test results at one time point. Thus, we believe that white blood cells, lymphocytes or other inflammation-related biomarkers tested at one time point have difficulty reflecting the inflammation status and predicting the clinical outcome. Dynamic monitoring of the inflammation process might be better in predicting the prognosis. Moreover, the results of our study were different from those of previous studies [1, 29] . One reason was that there were some missing data in the laboratory results. Another reason was that our patients were under 65 years old, which was different from the situation in previous studies in which the included patients were much older.",

The rates of comorbidity and of more than 1 comorbidity were lower than those in a previous report [11] . It is possible that our sample is too small to show statistical significance. On the other hand, we could not exclude the possibility that clinicians would suppose that young patients with combined coexisting conditions might have worse outcomes than those who did not, thus giving more attention to those patients. Studies have shown that mortality in critically ill patients is influenced by the patient-to-staff ratio [35] . However, no comorbidity was a risk factor for oxygen therapy, which does not mean that patients with coexisting conditions are safe.

This fact would influence the results and application of our study. Second, symptoms and coexisting conditions at admission were self-reported. Thus, there might be some inaccuracy. Last, the reason for oxygen therapy was difficult to define, although clinical practice guidelines were strictly followed by clinicians in all centers. Additionally, in the guidelines, the need for oxygen therapy is not indicated by arterial blood gas, perhaps due to the inconvenience of this special infectious disease. Thus, we could not determine whether every patient who received oxygen therapy had hypoxemia.",
