Access to safe, effective, and high-quality medicines for all people is one of the targets of the sustainable development goals. However, it is estimated that nearly two billion people have no access to basic medicines [2] . In 2019, roughly 5.2 million children under five years (2.4 million newborns) died because of reasons which can be prevented or treated through simple and affordable interventions such as adequate nutrition, immunization, and appropriate treatment of common childhood illnesses [3, 4] . Low availability, high medicine prices, and low affordability are several major barriers hindering access to EMs [2, 5] .",

In 2020, the national income per capita was approximately 183US$ (241US$ and 150US$ for people living in urban and rural areas, respectively) [10] . In general, the healthcare system of Vietnam can be divided into two sectors (public and private) with four administrative levels (central, provincial, district, and commune) [11] . About 77% of health professionals are working in public health facilities. The countrywide number of patient beds, doctors, and pharmacists was about 330.8 thousand beds (28.5 beds per 10,000 inhabitants), 96.2 thousand doctors (8.8 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants), and 27.5 thousand pharmacists (2.92 pharmacists per 10,000 inhabitants), respectively [12, 13] . In 2018, Vietnam possessed roughly 13,319 public health facilities, including 1,192 hospitals and 11,810 health stations. In addition, there were about 61,867 private medicine outlets stocking and trading pharmaceuticals and medical supplies all over Vietnam [13] . As per the Vietnam Ministry of Health (VMOH), in 2020, nearly 91% of the population have been covered by social health insurance. For different population groups, there are three levels of co-payment rates applied (including 0%, 5%, and 20%). For instance, the 0% rate is for people living below the breadline and children under six years of age. In other words, these people can be diagnosed and treated for diseases free of charge in the hospitals named in their health insurance cards [12] .",

In the past, these pharmaceuticals were selected based on the recommendations of healthcare professionals. In recent years, the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) has been commenced being used to generate evidence involving cost-effectiveness, thereby guaranteeing that medicines covered by health insurance were selected based on four following important criteria: clinical effectiveness, safety, budget impact, and cost-effectiveness [12] . The majority of medicines covered by health insurance are EMs. In 1985, the first NEML was published by the VMOH. The newest version is the 7 th NEML released in 2018, including 510 modern medicines and 737 herbal and traditional medicines [15] . There are several studies on medicine prices, availability, and affordability conducted in Vietnam before the year 2018 [16, 17] . From the year releasing the 7 th NEML to now, in Vietnam, there has been no study conducted to survey the availability, prices, and affordability of two types of EMs: originator brands (OBs) and lowest-priced generics (LPGs). Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct studies on EMs in Vietnam. This research was carried out to measure EMs' prices, availability, and affordability in the Hanam province of Vietnam.",

Verbal consent was obtained from all of the interviewees. The identity of interviewees and health facilities was kept confidential. The ethics committee did not require the research team to gain written consent from interviewees because in this study, we did not do clinical trials, did not take blood samples, and did not do any activities which could harm interviewees in any form. We only asked pharmacists about the availability and prices of medicines and therefore, it seems that the data-collection process did not have any detrimental effects on interviewees.

Five other areas include Thanhliem (including one town and 19 communes), Binhluc (including one town and 20 communes), Duytien (including two towns and 19 communes), Lynhan (including one town and 22 communes), and Kimbang (including one town and 18 communes) [19] . Most of the areas in this province are rural areas. The number of doctors working in health facilities was about 547 [10] . For the public sector, Hanam has roughly 137 public health facilities (with 3,350 patient beds), including 14 hospitals, 116 commune health stations, and 7 other facilities [20] . For the private sector, there are 20 pharmaceutical companies and 603 medicine outlets all over Hanam [21] . In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, this province was selected for investigation by reason of the following rationales. The first reason was the paucity of funds and human resources. Due to the travel restrictions, the process of data collection was much easier due to the adjacency between Hanam province and the Hanoi capital.

For the public sector, six following hospitals (including Phuly Provincial General Hospital, Duytien District General Hospital, Lynhan District General Hospital, Kimbang District General Hospital, Binhluc District General Hospital, and Thanhliem District General Hospital) were selected for six surveyed areas (they are main public hospitals). In addition, in each area, four other health facilities (other hospitals, healthcare centers, or health stations) were randomly selected for the public sector. A licensed private medicine outlet in the proximity of each of the selected public health facilities was selected for the private sector. All surveyed facilities were within three hours' travel of the main public hospitals and featured on the list of health facilities and licensed medicine outlets provided by the Hanam Department of Health. Because fewer than 50% of medicines were available at five private medicine outlets, five backup facilities were visited to collect additional data.

In addition, the mean availability of LPGs in Hanam was fairly high in the public sector (63.2%) but still low in the private sector (47.9%). These results were lower than findings from Iran (2014): 75.5% and 83.3% [30] , Malaysia (2017): 74.8% and 49.1% [31] ; higher than results of Lahore Division, Pakistan (2016-2017): 35.3% and 20.3% [26] , and Zhejiang, China (2018): 35.1% and 40.3% [27] , respectively for the public sector and the private sector. In general, the Hanam healthcare system can adequately supply EMs to meet inhabitants' needs. By virtue of low costs and national policies, generic medicines were usually prioritized in use in the public sector. Accordingly, the availability of OBs was low and patients were mainly treated with LPGs. In the private sector, the availability of morphine and diazepam was far lower than that in the public sector. These medicines are restricted in use and only a few private medicine outlets with special permission are eligible to sell them [32] . Regarding medicines used to treat diabetes (metformin and insulin) and cardiovascular diseases including hypertension (bisoprolol, captopril, enalapril, furosemide) and hypercholesterolemia (simvastatin, atorvastatin), their availability in the public sector was far higher than that in the private sector since these medicines were covered by health insurance. In public health facilities, patients with a health insurance card can nearly get these medicines free of charge. For albendazole and mebendazole, in Vietnam, the government annually conducts deworming campaigns for children. This can be a reason explaining the low availability of these anthelmintics in public facilities. In the private sector, the high prices of OBs, the low demands, and the low incomes of inhabitants can be several reasons explaining why the mean availability of OBs was low. In addition, thanks to the development of transportation and logistics systems, pharmacists said that although numerous medicines were unavailable in their medicine outlets, patients/customers could order various kinds of medicines they need and get them in the next several days. This can be the important rationale behind the low availability of many medicines in private medicine outlets, especially those covered by health insurance (for example simvastatin and bisoprolol). Although the costs of Ventolin (salbutamol), Diamicron (gliclazide), and Glucophage (metformin) were quite high, the availability of these OBs was far higher than that of LPGs. Three aforementioned OBs were popularly used in Vietnam because of their outstanding quality and efficiency.",

The mean availability of EMs in the rural areas was significantly lower than that in the urban areas. This can be a matter of concern because the countryside constitutes a majority of areas in many provinces of Vietnam. In addition, in rural areas, many people (especially senior citizens) are living below the poverty line. The low availability and high prices can be barriers hindering their access to EMs. As per WHO, the availability of EMs should be at least 80% [33, 34] . However, in this study, the availability of 11 EMs was lower than this benchmark. The government should have useful plans to expand access to EMs in the Vietnamese population, especially impoverished people living in the countryside.",

High cost is one reason (MPR = 5.04). In northern Ethiopia (2016), this medicine was even sold at 19.4 times and 26.2 times higher than its IPR, respectively for the public and private sectors [38] . There are several child-friendly formulations of paracetamol ubiquitously used in Vietnam (for example powder packet 150 mg and 250 mg). Unfortunately, their IRPs cannot be found in the 2015 International Medical Products Price Guide of MSH [23] . As a consequence, they cannot be surveyed in this study. Similar to paracetamol, the availability of co-trimoxazole suspension 40+8 mg/ml and albendazole 200 mg was low while their MPRs were high. The low availability and high prices of pediatric medicines were also reported in studies from Mongolia (2016) [39] , Jiangsu, China (2017) [40] , and Ethiopia (2018-2019) [41] . These three medicines are all in Quadrant II (low availability and high MPRs) in the comprehensive analyses of EMs' availability and prices. Children in Hanam may have difficulties in access to formulations that are suitable for them (such as suspensions and chewable tablets).",

As a result, it seems that unaffordability issues regarding OBs were insubstantial. Generally, the availability of generic medicines was fairly high and their prices were affordable. In recent years, the Vietnamese government has implemented many national policies to increase the availability of generic medicines and reduce medicine prices [49, 50] . Wholesale and retail prices of medicines were posted up at transaction or medicine-selling places. The maximum retail surplus for medicines sold at medicine retails within medical examination and treatment establishments was set. The declared wholesale and retail prices of medicines (at medicine trading establishments) and winning-bid prices of medicines used in public health facilities were published on the Ministry's e-portal [49] . In public facilities, a majority of medicines covered by health insurance are EMs. Furthermore, in 2019, the Vietnam Ministry of Health promulgated a list of 640 medicines that domestic pharmaceutical companies would have the capacity for manufacturing and supplying. This list mainly involves medicinetendering activities in public health facilities. For these 640 medicines, imported medicines having the same active ingredients, dosage forms, and doses are restricted in the bidding process and public health facilities mainly use low-priced medicines locally manufactured. In private medicine outlets, regarding medicine prices, the government only requires that all medicines stocking in any medicine outlet must be labeled with prices on the medicine containers (boxes). In order to monitor and control the quality of medicines, the Department of Health in each province periodically inspects and surveys private medicine outlets. Many samples of medicines are randomly selected and tested to assess their quality.",

By reason of the COVID-19 outbreak, the travel restrictions, and the paucity of funding and human resources, we are only able to conduct this research in one province devoid of COVID-19 patients, not for the whole country. This study had some limitations. Firstly, data on EMs were collected on the day of data collection, not reflect the average availability over time. Only 30 surveyed EMs cannot reflect the whole EMs on the market. As per WHO's instructions, medicines' availability was reported as mean and standard deviation although data was not normally distributed. Some medicines (such as paracetamol, gliclazide, metformin) were found in different strengths, so the low availability of these medications may not be meaningful. In addition, only medicines with an MSH IRP could be included in this survey. The data was collected in 2020 but the latest IRPs are for the year 2015. Last but not least, affordability was computed based on the government's lowest daily wage. However, many inhabitants could earn less than that value, especially farmers in rural areas.",

LPGs in both sectors were sold to patients at reasonable prices compared to IRPs.
