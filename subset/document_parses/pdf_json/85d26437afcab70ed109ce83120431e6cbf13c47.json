We also compared the ACE2 receptor blocking antibody levels with baseline antibodies of those who were found to be infected, and in another cohort of 36 individuals who had varying severity of natural infection 17 .

The first dose of Gam-COVID-19 vaccine was shown to induce an overall seroconversion rate of 88.7%, with significantly lower seroconversion rates (81.8%) and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels in individuals over 60 years of age. It induced ACE2-receptor blocking antibodies in 82.6% of individuals and the levels were significantly lower than levels seen following a single dose of AZD1222 and those following natural infection. Therefore, the overall antibody responses following a single dose of Gam-COVID-Vac appear to be significantly lower than those following a single dose of AZD1222, especially in older individuals in a Sri Lankan population 13 . Older individuals are known to have impaired innate and adaptive immune responses to new antigens due to multiple factors such as compromised antigen presentation, T cell exhaustion and a limited B cell receptor repertoire in memory B cells leading to development of antibodies with poor affinity and avidity 20 . Therefore, due to the reduced immunogenicity of Gam-COVID-Vac, and due to the rapid decline in immune responses to some COVID-19 vaccines 21 , different dosing schedules and booster dosing schedules may have to be implemented in older individuals.",

However, the proportion of individuals who developed antibodies were less than those reported in the phase 1/2 study, in which 100% of the study participants developed antibodies to the RBD by 21 days 6 . These differences could be due to the differences in the assays used, ages of the individuals included (we had included individuals > 60 years of age), sample size (n = 18 in the published study compared to n = 69 in this study) and possible pre-existing antibodies to Ad26 reducing vaccine immunogenicity in Sri Lanka 27 . The lower RBD antibodies to the WT and ACE2 receptor blocking antibodies in our cohort of patients, especially in those who were > 60 years of age, in comparison to the published data, could be due to the differences in the seropositivity rates for adenovirus 26 in different age groups in different populations 12 . It was previously shown that individuals who were seropositive for adenovirus 5, had a higher risk of acquiring HIV following immunization with an HIV vaccine with adenovirus 5 28 . This increased risk of acquiring HIV was thought to be due to reduced HIV specific CD4+ T cell responses and a reduced breadth of CD8+ T cell responses, in vaccine recipients who were seropositive for adenovirus 5 29 . As pre-existing anti-vector immunity is likely to dampen the immune responses to vaccines, it would be important to study the seroprevalence of antibodies to the adenovirus vector used in such vaccines, in order to further understand the effect of a vaccine when rolling it out in a population.",

ACE2 receptor blocking antibody responses were seen in 82.6% of individuals, with levels significantly lower than after a single dose of AZD1222 and following natural infection. While the antibody responses to the RBD by HAT were similar to AZD1222, the ex vivo IFN\u03b3 ELISpot responses were significantly lower. The findings suggest that the two Gam-COVID-19 doses using heterologous adenoviruses may be of particular importance in certain populations. This data further highlights the importance of studying the prevalence of different adenoviruses and how pre-existing immunity affects the immune responses to different adenovirus vector vaccines. This information is viral in order to determine timing and targeting additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines.",

The RBD-specific antibody titre for the serum sample was defined by the last well in which the complete absence of \"teardrop\" formation was observed. The HAT titration was performed using 7 doubling dilutions of serum from 1:20 to 1:1280, to determine presence of RBD-specific antibodies. A titre of 1:20 was considered as a positive response, as previously determined by us 19 . The IH4-RBD reagents for each VOC were standardized by titration with the monoclonal antibody EY-6A 18,34 that binds to a conserved epitope common to all variants. A 20 \u03bcg/ml solution of EY-6A titrated equally with a standard (2 \u03bcg/ml) solution of each of the new IH4-RBD reagents.

Intracellular cytokine staining was carried out in freshly isolated PBMCs.PBMCs were incubated with CD107a FITC (Biolegend, USA) for 30 min in RPMI 1640 and 10% heat inactivated human serum (Sigma Andrich). Cells were stimulated with overlapping peptides pool of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for 2 h at 1 mM concertation before adding monensin (Biolegend, USA). The PBMC were incubated for a further 14 h before staining with with anti-CD3 APC Cy7 (clone OKT3), anti-CD8 BV650 (clone SK1) and anti-CD4 PB (clone OKT4). Then the cells were fixed with fixation buffer and permeabilized with perm wash buffer (Biolegend, USA) and stained for IFN-\u03b3 APC (clone 4S. B3). Live/Dead fixable aqua dead cell stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol to exclude dead cells. Cells were acquired on a BD FACSAria III Cell Sorter using DIVA v8 software (BD Biosciences, USA). For each donor, unstimulated cells were included as a negative control. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo v.10.7.1 software (FlowJo). Fluoresces Minus One (FMO) controls were used to draw the gates for both CD107a and IFN-\u03b3 (Supplementary",
