Moreover, the prognostic utility of TLC, d-dimmer, urea, and CRP was done using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve); the area under the curve AUC above 0.6 is considered acceptable for test capability.

This finding is attributed to severe virus infection that developed into sepsis and induced coagulation dysfunction. Also, the increase of d-dimer may be an indirect manifestation of inflammatory reaction, as inflammatory cytokines could cause the imbalance of coagulation and fibrinolysis in the alveoli, which may activate the fibrinolysis system and then increase the level of d-dimer [8] .",
