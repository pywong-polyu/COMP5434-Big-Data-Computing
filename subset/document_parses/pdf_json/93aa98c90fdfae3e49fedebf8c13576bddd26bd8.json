Due to the high mutation rates of the RNA virus, several SARS-CoV-2 variants are circulating throughout the world which include alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron. To date, there are many vaccines authorized for emergency use, e.g., mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, AZD1222, JNJ-78436735, and CoronaVac. However, they are all designed using the wild-type strain. The advent of SARS-CoV-2 mutations raises concerns regarding the long-term efficacy of existing vaccines. The possibility of vaccination escape, in which vaccine-generated immunity is insufficient to give disease protection, is a concern. The existence of convalescent or vaccine-mediated immunity, together with high viral transmission, may accelerate the emergence of escape mutants. Although in vitro findings demonstrate a decrease in neutralizing antibody titers, the efficacy of available spike-based vaccines against the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of concern (VOC) does not appear to be jeopardized (Emary et al., 2021; Hall et al., 2021) . So, to be able to catch up with the viral mutations in vaccine development is extremely difficult because the research, development, and clinical trial are time-consuming and expensive. Thus, the alternative strategy is to systematically evaluate the protective Abbreviations: CoVariant, SARS-CoV-2 variant; ACE2, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. efficacy of the current vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

AZD1222, which is developed at Oxford University and comprises the SARS-CoV-2 structural surface glycoprotein antigen, spike protein gene in a replicationdeficient chimp adenoviral vector ChAdOx1.

The protein microarray platform is highly suited because it can immobilize multiple antigens and profile humoral immunity (Syu et al., 2020) . Our group and others have developed different types of protein microarrays to profile the serum antibodies in COVID-19 patients (de Assis et al., 2021; Du et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2020) and after vaccination with BBIBP-CorV (Ma et al., 2021) . In addition to serum antibodies, neutralizing antibodies is the most important component for blocking viral entry. Until now, there is no existing platform that has multiple variant antigens nor measuring the neutralizing antibody against multiple variants. In this study, we developed a multiplexed SARS-CoV-2 Variant (CoVariant) protein array by immobilizing wild-type and eight spike variants on a slide. By incubating with anti-spike and ACE2, the CoVariant can simultaneously detect the quantity of antibody and surrogate neutralizing activity on each spike protein variant in a single assay. In addition, sera from cohorts of patients who received one or two doses of the mRNA 1273 (Moderna) or AZD1222 (AstraZeneca) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants were used to assess the surrogate neutralization and antibody profiles after vaccination.",

Wild-type and variant spike proteins along with some control proteins were printed in triplicates on the aldehyde-coated slides and formed the most comprehensive CoVariant protein microarray. The CoVariant protein arrays were quality checked for protein immobilization, reproducibility, and protein functions. The protein immobilization was confirmed by bright signals of anti-His and anti-S staining (Fig. 1b,  d, 1e ). The reproducibility was evaluated by two independent anti-His stainings and showed a 0.999 r square value (Fig. 1f) .

In AZD1222, the IgG level was increased after one dose and remained at a high level after the second dose. Only after two doses of AZD1222 were able to induce the IgA level. As a result, the surrogate neutralizing activity was higher in two doses than one dose of AZD1222. In mRNA-1273, the IgG level was elevated after one dose and further evoked after the second dose. The IgM level was also evoked after the second dose of mRNA-1273. Moreover, the IgM level played a key role in the ability of the convalescent plasma to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (Gasser et al., 2021) . As a result, the two doses of mRNA-1273 showed better surrogate neutralizing activity than the two doses of AZD1222.

We found the abundant elevation of IgG isotypes against the spike and its variants after partially and fully vaccination may indicate long-term protection. Our findings were consistent with others that showed dominant IgG isotypes in either vector or mRNA vaccines (Ewer Fig. 5 .

Sera from partial, fully, or unvaccinated subjects were collected and analyzed for their IgA bindings by using CoVariant protein arrays. a IgA bindings against wildtype SARS-CoV-2 in partial, fully, and unvaccinated subjects. c-i IgA bindings against eight common SARS-CoV-2 variants. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc tests, p < 0.05 between different letters. Jalkanen et al., 2021) . Among humoral responses, the surrogate neutralizing activities were the most valuable parameters for mimicking the infection. Several studies have shown a link between the level of neutralization and the risk of infection for SARS-CoV-2 (Addetia et al., 2020; Khoury et al., 2021a) . As a result, the quantity of the humoral response after immunization, which coincides with neutralizing antibody titers (Khoury et al., 2021b) , may be clinically significant.",

The cell membrane was prepared by harvesting 5 \u00d7 10 6 cells, washed, and extracted by a membrane isolation kit (ThermoFisher, #89842). The slides were precoated with aldehyde and stored at 4 \u2022 C as previously described (Du et al., 2021) . Each sample was printed in triplicate in each block (9 \u00d7 10 format) and 14 identical blocks per slide using a contact printer (CapitalBio, #SmartArrayer 136). After printing, the CoVariant protein microarrays were immobilized overnight, vacuum-sealed, and stored at 4 \u2022 C for a short term (<6 months) or at \u2212 80 \u2022 C for a long term (6 months to a few years). The immobilization and functionality of the proteins on the microarrays were assessed by anti-His, anti-spike, and ACE2.",
