            "text": "Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many medical schools are forced to switch courses of the mandatory curriculum to online teaching formats. However, little information about feasibility and effectiveness is available yet about distance teaching in anatomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a histology course previously taught in a classroom setting into an online-only format based on video conference software. Methods: Our course design included theoretical introductions, an online-adaptation of virtual microscopy used previously in the classroom, and active learning elements such as collaborative learning in breakout rooms, annotation assignments and multiple-choice questions. Two preclinical semester cohorts of around 400 second and third semester students were taught in histology in parallel courses, using the Zoom software platform. We analyzed data about student attendance during the course, summative quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the students and results of a written test required to pass the course. Results: We observed that student attendance was high and stable during the 19 course days for both second and third semester, and only few students reported technical problems. There were no significant differences in examination results of second semester compared to the third semester, an unexpected result as the third semester already participated in the dissection course before. Similarly, no significant gender-related effects on the examination performance could be noted in both semesters. However, the age of students was negatively correlated with test scores in the second and third semester. Importantly, the overall evaluation of the digital version of the histology course was at least as positive as the in-person version over the past years. Conclusion: Together, we experienced that the implementation of a curricular histology course in an online-format is technically realizable, effective and well accepted among students. We also observed that availability and prior experience with digitized specimen in virtual microscopy facilitates transition into an online-only setting. Thus, our study supports the positive potential of distance learning for teaching anatomy during and after COVID-19 pandemic but also emphasizes the need for a synchronous learning environment with partially personnel-intensive small group settings to overcome passivity and inequality aspects, and to foster active learning elements.",

Even though the infection curve has flattened and increased again in most European countries, it seems that our society needs to cope with the virus and the regularities 2016; Langfield et al., 2018) , digital self-learning tools (Appaji et al., 2010; Rinaldi et al., 2017) , radiology tools (O'Rourke et al., 2020; Royer, 2016) , VR-technology (Birbara et al., 2020; Bork et al., 2020; Chytas et al., 2020) , video feedback (Donkin et al., 2019) , 3D-printed anatomical models (Smith et al., 2018) and social media elements (Maske et al., 2018) , have already been proposed, yet there is only little experience with online-only anatomy teaching. Considering the special requirements of anatomical teaching with regard to practical application of knowledge (Schoeman and Chandratilake, 2012) , the implementation of general recommendations derived from those studies turn out to be difficult and subject-specific solutions are necessitated. As a result, quite different formats could be observed in medical schools in response to COVID-19 pandemic regarding the use of resources, assessment strategies and performance of anatomy teaching (Longhurst et al., 2020; Pather et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Histology and microscopic anatomy, core disciplines of anatomy, traditionally involve the practical utilization of optical microscopes in order to identify cellular and subcellular structures with the goal to understand the structure-function relationship of cell types and tissues. Histology and gross anatomy are taught separately at most universities but the order of teaching these subjects is handled differently. Simultaneously with the technological progress (Aeffner et al., 2018; Zarella et al., 2019) , more and more digital tools for histology teaching have been developed over the last two decades: the use of virtual instead of optical microscopy (Helle et al., 2013; Kuo and Leo, 2019; Mione et al., 2013; Paulsen et al., 2010) , interactive e-learning platforms (Khalil et al., 2013; Sander and Golas, 2013) , technology-supported interactive response systems (Rinaldi et al., 2017) , flipped-classroom approaches (Cheng et al., 2017) and others (Black and Smith, 2004; Kotz\u00e9 and Mole, 2015; Zilverschoon et al., 2019) . Some of these elements have already been integrated successfully in the curriculum within a blended-learning format (Merk et al., 2010) , but only few attempts to teach a histology course in a completely digital format have been reported yet (Barbeau et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "When implementing education from face-to-face into online settings it is important to monitor that all students make the transition to the new education environment equally well and that no subgroup is \"left behind\". This is particularly important, since recent observations have shown an emergency of learning inequalities in remote teaching (Czerniewicz et al., 2020) . Therefore, we paid attention to particular groups of students when implementing our online-only digital histology class during the Corona pandemic: One important variable is the gender-related use of information and communication technology (ICT). When the technologies were introduced first, male students were engaged more in ICT than female students (Lockheed, 1985) . The gender-moderated differences in computer literacy, however, decreased over time with a tendency to even favoring female students over the past years (Fraillon et al., 2014) . The tendency is in line with the observation that female students seem to be better at communicating online and are more self-disciplined in the use of online resources (McSporran and Young, 2001) . Another relevant aspect are agerelated effects in an online learning environment. Students born after 1980 grew up with ICT and are referred to as \"digital natives\", suggesting that most of the younger students are familiar with online environments. Medicine students in Germany show considerable variance concerning age at most universities because the selection procedure facilitates a certain percentage of more mature students to study medicine. Mature students are students, who are older than the average age, often set to a cut-off point of 25 years (Tones et al., 2009) . In general, mature students have had a longer time since graduating from high-school and might have acquired additional responsibilities (e. g. family, financial support etc.) compared to younger students (Imlach et al., 2017; Ngo-Ye, 2014) .",

The system requirements include a stable wired or wireless (>3G) broadband internet connection, as well as speakers, microphone and a webcam. Multiple operating systems (macOS 10.9 or later, Windows 7 or later, several Linuxbased systems) and browsers (IE, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari) are supported.

Potential critical functions of Zoom, for example login via a Facebook account, were deactivated in our version of the software. To join sessions, students had to register with their university ID and password. After successful registration students received an email with a hyperlink and a password to the conference session. In order to control for authorization, we matched the registered students with the official list of participants for the course before we enabled the participation. Students used the software with a desktop client, which can be downloaded for free and without a license. To host sessions lasting longer than 40 min with many participants, the lectures used commercial licenses acquired by the University of M\u00fcnster.

Influencing aspects of student attendance can be divided in personal factors, course-related factors and in unavoidable factors such as illness or family commitments (Lang et al., 2008) . In order to successfully pass, regular participation in the histology course is mandatory at our university with an obligatory attendance rate of over 85%. However, we could observe in the past that the absenteeism rate is increasing on Fridays or on a day between a weekend and a statutory holiday, where students tend to use the \"gap day\" for private activities. Further, when an exam in another subject is approaching, students tend to skip histology course days. We therefore monitored attendance of students on each digital histology course day using meta-data provided by Zoom (Fig. 2a) . Because of technical issues such as instable internet connections, the attendance rate fluctuated slightly, mostly at the beginning and end of breakout room settings (not shown).",

Even though many universities around the world have been using blended-learning formats in histology for many years, the conceptualization and implementation of online-only courses into the curriculum have not been systematically evaluated yet. It is crucial in the educational process to determine the outcomes of teaching and guidance. It is particularly important because the current discussion clearly emphasizes learning inequality during the COVID-19 pandemic (Czerniewicz et al., 2020) . Therefore, a closer look at the digital transformation and its nuances helps us not just to give feedback to the faculty, but to understand where exactly putative problems and challenges of our students are in order to develop more effective and fair curricula. As many others organizations, our institute introduced virtual microscopy back in the years 2008/2009 to support undergraduate teaching of histology. Experiences gained during these years and development of our software \"Virtuelle Mikroskopie\" facilitated the transition into an online.only format. Positive experiences with video conferencing tools during the pandemic have been recently reported (Srinivasan, 2020) , as well as positive results of newly developed e-learning tools in histological education (Drees et al., 2020) .",

Their results revealed that the online students outperformed the on-site students in a pre-post-test, and furthermore showed more frequent interactions amongst students and between students and instructors. The limitation of this study derives from the number of participants, which was quite low with only n = 11 students attending the online-course. Several years later, in 2013, Barbeau et al. investigated the effects of an online-only digital histology course in a virtual classroom with synchronous and asynchronous lectures, which they offered during the summer term 2011 (Barbeau et al., 2013) . No significant differences between the students' performance and course ratings in online class was found when compared to face-to-face classes and mixed classes, teaching face-to-face and online simultaneously. However, the validity of this study is limited due to the low evaluation rate of only 36% in the online class and 6.3% in the mixed group.",

Struggling with technical issues can reduce student's engagement, increase drop-out rates and significantly influence the learning experience. Our experience shows that even though the technical preparation of the teaching platform was accurate, unpredicted complications such as compatibility problems or software updates can occur and interrupt the learning session. This is likely to happen in larger semester cohorts in particular. Based on our experience, we recommend to have at least one coworker with digital proficiencies available during the course, who is just monitoring the proceedings, the chat function and the waiting room for students with technical issues, always ready to intervene in the background without disturbing or interrupting the course itself. This coworker should be introduced to the students in the first lecture as a contact person for technical issues. Yet we recommend to prepare a plan-b, especially when using digital learning methods such as breakout rooms.",

            "text": "While recent observations of online teaching have shown that digital learning is realizable (Cuschieri and Calleja Agius, 2020; Srinivasan, 2020) , we wanted to know if it is also accepted by our students. The digital transformation of a standard histology course described above was well accepted among our students of two different semesters. Satisfaction with e-learning environments is a significant aspect in the evaluation of general learning environments (Virtanen et al., 2016) . This is reflected by high and stable attendance rates in synchronous learning sessions (Fig. 2a) and the positive course evaluations (Fig. 4a) . It should be noted that though the course was mandatory, the students could miss up to 4 days without failing regular attendance. Interestingly, fluctuations in the students' attendance, which we regularly observe in face-to-face courses, where students tend to be more absent towards the end of the course, did not occur. One reason may be higher comfort and time-saving aspects of the remote access opportunity. However, since most of the students switched off their webcams during the classes, it is not verified, whether they were actually participating actively in the class or if they were just present or logged in during the teaching period. Regarding the decreasing rates of webcam activity during the course (Fig. 2b) , we conclude that it is uncomfortable for the students to switch on their webcams during the whole session, as they may feel observed by others or do not want others \"invade\" their privacy. Although the reasons to prefer anonymity were not entirely clear, limited equipment or inferior WiFi connections were frequently cited. Another explanation might be that the students have the tendency to \"lay back\" in online settings or were confronted with cognitive overload (Ambrose, 2020) . Since more webcams were switched on during the breakout sessions, in which more attendance with a video signal could be observed (not quantitated), the technical issues are surely not the only reason for the observed reluctance to share the video signal. However, the strong tendency to hide behind a black screen led our faculty to the decision to make attendance with active video signal generally mandatory in the current winter term 2020/2021. Nevertheless, based on the written evaluations, examination results and our experiences in the breakout rooms, we had the impression that most students actively participated in the course.",

This result is indicating the student's preference of more active learning elements, which has repeatedly been shown to improve examination performance when compared to passive learning in medical education (Graffam, 2007; Kooloos et al., 2020) . The finding is also in line with the acceptance and effectiveness of virtual microscopy (Aeffner et al., 2018; Barbeau et al., 2013; Gatumu et al., 2014; Hamilton et al., 2012; Kuo and Leo, 2019; Lee et al., 2018; Paulsen et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2011) , which can be adopted excellently into distance learning of histology. Moreover, students' request for more \"mini quizzes\" seems omnipresent (Srinivasan, 2020) . In contrast, the use of breakout rooms was somehow controversial among students (Fig. 4b) . Our data suggest that the breakout room sessions were not rejected per se, but the framework should be changed: The students mostly prefer smaller breakout rooms with up to four students each and with shorter durations of less than 20 min. However, many students evaluated breakout room sessions as a good opportunity to ask questions and overcome the anonymity of digital learning environments. Evidence from the research about computer-supported cooperative learning can be embedded to further improve collaboration quality in breakout sessions in the future (Radkowitsch et al., 2020) .",

This is a surprising result; however, the failure rate was 10% lower in this group. We predicted that an extensive engagement with gross anatomy had spillover effects on histology performance based on greater familiarity with anatomical terminology, understanding function of organs and transfer of knowledge. It could also be a manifestation of the phenomenon that students \"learn only as much as is necessary to pass\", which could explain the same overall performance, but lower failure rate in the third semester. This result has limitations: An important confounder for this observation is that the students in the third semester had a different schedule parallel to our course, including seminars in biochemistry and physiology. This schedule likely represents a higher work-load, and thus, the third semester might not have had the same amount of time to prepare for the exam. Another important limitation of this study is that about one third of students in both semesters attended the course but did not participate in the exam. This phenomenon of procrastination increased over the last years but was, similarly observed in faceto-face settings, too. The reasons for the drop-outs are not clear, however there might be different reasons: Some students may have decided to skip the course right away in order to repeat it in the next semester with better preparation. Others could have been overloaded with the material or may have had private issues or that they struggled with the online environment. These results should be considered when restructuring the curriculum in the future.",

To identify the so called \"at-risk\" students, some universities started to develop predictive models based on machine learning methods and student activity data (Wolff et al., 2013) . An association between gender, ethnicity and majors with repeating anatomy examination have been proposed in face-to-face environments (Schutte, 2016) . Students who participate less active in face-to-face settings seem to participate less in online environments as well (Holland et al., 2016) . Along this line, online courses have been suggested to be less effective for weaker students (Jaggars and Bailey, 2010) . Reduced attendance and interaction were suggested to be one important reason for this phenomenon (Stuckey-Mickell and Stuckey-Danner, 2007) . Furthermore, when offered both face-to-face lectures and online resources, it has been shown that repeating students tend to overlook the online material (Holland et al., 2016) .",

There is evidence that female and male students differ in their interaction with technology (e.g. caused by increased use of interactive elements) (Cuadrado-Garc\u00eda et al., 2010) and that female students perform better in e-learning environments (Fraillon et al., 2014) . Psychological constructs, such as test anxiety has been shown to be crucial for female students' performance in online environments, whereas self-efficacy for learning and performance was more important for male students (Yukselturk and Bulut, 2009 ). Even though the literature is favoring female students as more successful in online academic achievement, our data do not suggest gender-related effects on performance for undergraduate medical students (Fig. 3d) . This observation can be explained by a cohort-specific effect. Notwithstanding the conceptualization of the course with numerous collaborative elements with random assignments of the students into the breakout rooms may have additionally contributed to it. Auxiliary of human-human or human-machine interactions through guidance in online learning environments could be further achieved by predefined collaboration scripts (Fischer et al., 2013) , a reasonable opportunity especially for undergraduate students. However, relevant endpoints -other than examination performance -were not measured in this study and cannot be ruled out.",

            "text": "Concerning age and exam performance, a significantly negative correlation has been found in both semesters (Fig. 3c) . Since the oldest student in this study is around 40 years old, it seems unlikely that this effect is caused by a lack of computer literacy or access to ICT. So, do age have a direct effect on academic output? Considering numerous factors, it has been shown that age itself not be associated with academic performance (Imlach et al., 2017) . Many other variables, such as intrinsic factors (e. g. motivation, personality)and extrinsic factors (e. g. learning environment) were shown to be better predictors of academic success (Laidra et al., 2007) . The question remains, why mature students of both semester cohorts in our study performed worse than younger students. An explanation could be that mature students traditionally exhibit different characteristics concerning socio-economic status, motivation and other social and psychological variables (Schuetze and Slowey, 2000) . Often, the double burden of having a job outside of university leads to less learning time. Mature students in Germany mostly completed an apprenticeship in the medical field, which helped them entering into medical school and where they continue working during medical school. Yet in our experience, they appear more courageous in the interactions, contributing tremendous amount of input into the collaboration groups and younger students often benefit from the clinical-practical knowledge of mature students. The question remains, whether the worse academic performance of mature students in online histology might be explained by effects other than the digital learning environment itself or is apparent in the same way also in face-to-face environments.",

Although it is not entirely clear whether these students may learn the content to the same extent as in face-to-face settings, it remains questionable that they are able to actively apply their knowledge to new questions which is one of the main educational objectives of histology lab courses. We highly recommend synchronous lectures and interactive elements such as breakout-sessions in order to give individual feedback and instructions. Teachers should be aware of this passivity-problem in distance learning and actively counteract not only during the lectures but also with offerings inside and outside the virtual classroom. This however requires huge personnel resources and is at least as much cost-intensive as on-site teaching. One should definitely not come to the misconception, that technology is replacing the lecturers or the effort that is necessary for the preparation of a good lecture. The usage of technology strongly depends on the specific context of medical education, the individuals and circumstances and is subject to continuous development and change.",

Showing less online activity, less interactions and subsequent physical and social isolation, the pandemic might hit weaker students and repeating students even more severely. From a constructivist perspective the lack of social-interactions and the opportunity to attend co-constructional processes may pose a hindrance, which is especially plausible for asynchronous learning environments with video lectures only (Langfield et al., 2018) . We experienced that frequent and instructed group work in breakout sessions have the potential to increase online interactions and -at least partiallyovercome this issue in a short-term. Mandatory attendance and enforced webcam activity might further integrate all students into the learning environment. In addition, remedial programs in medical education, which have been proposed to support study skills (e. g. time management and self-regulation skills etc.) of at-risk students (Kalet et al., 2017; McGinn et al., 2020) need to be relocated into an online format to provide further support.",

Another limitation derives from the fact that around one third of the students who participated in the online histology lectures did not register for the examination due to procrastination, indicating a survivorship bias of the data.
