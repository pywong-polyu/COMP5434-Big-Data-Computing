However, in the last three decades, increasing access to this knowledge through growing bodies of literature, research studies, first-hand narratives of sex workers, and social media has been contributing to the expanding academic discourse about the commercial sex industry. Overall, the consensual sex work market is divided into two main categories: indoor providers and outdoor providers (Flowers 2011) . Each consists of multiple subgroups, which are influenced by the practitioner's race, age, perceived physical attractiveness, geographical location, and professional experience.",

            "text": "Outdoor providers comprise the bulk of the US-based sex worker demographic. The literature describes them as predominantly young cisgender women of color who originate from low-income urban communities. Yet, these statistics are somewhat inflated because Black cisgender female sex workers are arrested at higher rates than their white counterparts and have more contact with the legal system (Flowers 2011). The arrest records of the women, particularly when there is high recidivism, are conflated with estimations of the actual number of black cisgender women among outdoor providers. According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics (2011) and the National Center for Victims of Crime (2013) , in metropolitan areas, Black female sex workers comprise 40% of the street-level sex work demographic, and the proportion is probably lower in suburbs and nonurban communities. In fact, the largest outdoor US-based sex worker demographic is that of white adolescent cisgender women (Flowers 2011). Most are either runaways or \"throwaways,\" referring to a minor who was forced to leave home. This statistic is supported by numerous studies that reflect the perspective of white female sex workers. In contrast to indoor providers, personal safety is not built into the outdoor provider's professional experience; and these women operate in unsafe working environments and are significantly more vulnerable to high-risk clients who are psychologically unstable and physically unhealthy (Blair 2010; Ditmore 2011 Ditmore , 2006 Flowers 2011; Krusi et al. 2012 ).",

In the late 1990s, the personal advertising sections of printed media moved online and free listing sites, such as Craigslist, rapidly became a new and safer means to negotiate with clients replacing transactions that theretofore had been taking place on the streets.",

One such organization is Hacking/Hustling, a collective of sex workers, researchers, and computer technologists.

COVID-19 mitigation by mandatory social distancing hit female providers the hardest across all demographics (Wenham et al. 2020; Walter and McGregor 2020) . It follows that lower-income Black cisgender female providers may become more amenable to engaging in high-risk behavior to survive (Blair 2010; Gentile 2020; Tharoor 2020) . Webcam, phone sex, and interactive porn offer opportunities for safer and paid contact, but Black street sex workers may not be able to take full advantage of these opportunities unless it had been a component of their work pre-COVID-19 (Naftulin 2020) . Sex workers report that it is sometimes inconceivable to stop working, and the decision to stop is based on a host of external factors that influence daily behaviors, such as whether or not to travel to a reliable \"big money\" client or to an unsafe location chosen by a violent pimp (Gentile 2020; Holmes 2013) . It is not surprising that Black cisgender female sex workers are among the most vulnerable groups during the pandemic. Anti-Black sentiment and the lack of access to crucial resources, including health care, support groups, and alternative financial opportunities, threaten the sex worker's ability to survive the global crisis.",

Our primary concerns were confidentiality and privacy. In-person sessions were emotionally intense. After 5 years of working together, we had crafted our own language. We were both US-born, first generation children of Black Panamanian working-class immigrants. Nonverbal communication was a crucial component of the treatment because she was a sex worker of color. The use of our bodies, specific facial expressions, and eye movements to convey delicate information is part of our cultural heritage. Implicitly, we both understood that certain things just cannot be said out loud, even when no one else was listening. The videoconference modality threatened that connection. Neither of us felt safe with the new platform. The popular Zoom videoconference computer program represented an oppressive entity, as we were forced to stop inperson sessions, at least temporarily. Dana was preoccupied about the duration of the online sessions. She foresaw that her resistance to attend remote sessions could have a negative impact on our new online relationship. I, on the other hand, was secretly pleased. I was facing the final presentation of my doctoral program, and she knew about it; but she did not know the urge I felt to cancel our sessions until I had completed my degree.",

But on March 25, she had a flat affect and minimal body language and responded to my inquiries vaguely. The interaction felt as if we were slightly hostile acquaintances. Throughout the session she continued to sit quietly, looking down at what seemed to be the floor, occasionally glancing up at the camera, but her gaze never directly met mine. I thought \"I could be using this time for my project.\" I resented this awkward exchange and ended the session prematurely, advising that it would be more productive if we spoke at a time that was better for her. In retrospect, I must have sounded condescending and patronizing. I justified my response, reasoning that social distancing significantly impacted her ability to work, affecting her mood. We concluded the session confirming that we would continue meeting but, at her suggestion, reducing the frequency to once a week until she felt more comfortable with the new format. I was not curious, nor did I inquire about her request. I was ecstatic. On April 1, Dana was 15 minutes late to our second online session.

I was thinking to myself: you should have gone to school, invested in yourself. Look at me: you could have done something different. It is your fault. I was also terrified about her choice to continue to work with clients who she did not know. Absolutely terrified about her health and safety. I was also preoccupied about liability that I may have in this situation. We discussed safety precautions; however, our conversations did not feel as if they were enough. So many people were dying daily. I am not sure that I did my best here and judged myself harshly for it. I had hopes of working with Dana on a transition plan and assisting her with creating a new identity; when I was sure that those hopes were no longer a priority to Dana, I became even more resentful. I felt immense shame for thinking this way, but the thoughts flooded me, and I did not have the control or perspective to stop them.] Dana: It is true. Look at everything that is happening now with the police. I am scared in a very different way than I have ever been. My life is at stake in a very different way. I sometimes feel a lack of inherent self-worth. I try, I really do, to feel good, to care for myself, and then I figure what is the point? When there is a loud voice telling you are nothing, you hear it; even when you try to tune it out, you hear it, and you believe it.",

I feel a sort of slippage though like I am going to wake up, be alive, but not exist. Cannot really explain it. This fuels my increased anxiety, panic, drinking, and hair-pulling. I do not have suicidal thoughts, but I sometimes think about the fine line between existing as a body and not as a person, remaining in a dissociative state so I can be just numb.",

I was a black woman who had somehow lost touch with her and the sense of empathy that had previously provided Dana with a feeling of strength and empowerment, at a time she needed me the most. Moreover, how was I going to process these feelings with a white supervisor who, I knew, held implicit bias towards me and towards the patient despite our connection. My supervisor and I had also been working together for 5 years, and we got along very well, but she was an older white woman who grew up in the forties in Middle America where racist ideology was, and is, a part of her cultural perspective.

            "text": "As the current societal discourse has unfolded, the Black experience in the United States can only be fully appreciated by fellow Blacks. For that reason, Black therapists are expected to have better outcomes with their Black patients. While it can be assumed that Dana and I share several collective traumas in common, namely, the COVID-19 crisis and the ongoing pandemic of racism, our reactions reflect our respective positions in society -me as a newly minted doctoral graduate and Dana as a sex worker trapped by her history and present circumstances due to COVID-19. Although we have demographics and potential exposure to COVID-19 in common, shared trauma does not imply that we \"share\" the same experience. Rather, the term acknowledges that I, as Dana's therapist, have reactions to her trauma history and discussion of COVID-19, while also contending with my own independent reactions to the convergence of the two pandemics. As a Black woman who has been chronically exposed to racism and now to the coronavirus pandemic, I have my own trauma narrative to tell. Paradoxically, our differences in background, family situations, professions, and societal positions need to be respected to more fully appreciate the trauma we share. To conclude, the complex empathy and rejection reactions experienced by a therapist who has endured similar lifelong societal abuse as their patient (as outlined here) need further exploration in the professional literature. This chapter is but a modest beginning step towards that end, as it is a nascent but essential step for Dana to enter the societal discourse on racism in America.",

Was I going to be able to write the articles, teach the classes, reform structural injustice in existing institutions, or create my own? Was I going to live up to the expectations of my family, friends, and professors who believed in me and dedicated their time to get me through this arduous journey?

I was ashamed that I had worked so hard in my doctoral program to flee the common stereotypes, but that someone could still mistake me for a sex worker, a criminal instead of a doctor. I was angry at her for not being \"a credit to her race\"; I continued to listen as my stomach slowly churned.] Therapist: Tell me more about the \"new\" threats on your life. Dana: I have always been under siege, in a sense. My father raped me. My first pimp/boyfriend raped me too and beat me. I am an intimate partner violence survivor, always have been. I experience very subtle forms of racism, so I am trying to put my finger on it. It is hard to identify; it kind of feels like I am slowly being erased. It is hard to describe.

We both need mutual confirmation that our collective and individual contributions to life do matter. To assist my endeavor, I concluded supervision sessions and now seek the guidance of a Black woman to work through these issues. I cannot afford to let Dana down. I may look the part, but I do not have the stereotypical proletariat Black experience. My dual identity creates a multifaceted complexity to our interactions. On the one hand, my skin color, accent, and implicit cultural understanding deepen the bond between us. Dana often shares that our bond allows her to feel and articulate the most vulnerable parts of herself. She is a therapist's dream. Yet, the other identity, the one about which I am still not entirely certain, creates a divide between us and complicates the treatment.
