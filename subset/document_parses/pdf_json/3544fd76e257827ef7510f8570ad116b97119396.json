The control group was fed with basal diet, and the treatment group was fed with basal diet containing Bacillus cereus PAS38 1\u00d710 6 CFU/g. Thymus and bursa of fabricius were taken from two groups of broilers at the age of 42 days, total RNA was extracted, differential gene library was constructed by SSH technology, and immune-related differential genes were screened. Then, we used siRNA to interfere with the expression of some differential genes in the original generation lymphocytes of broiler blood to detect the change of cytokines mRNA expression level. A total of 42 immune-related differentially expressed genes were screened, including 22 up-regulated genes and 20 down-regulated genes. When 7 differentially up-regulated genes associated with enhanced immune function were interfered with in lymphocytes, some immune-promoting cytokines were down-regulated. These results showed that Bacillus cereus PAS38 might upregulate the expression of JCHAIN, PRDX1, CD3E, CDK6 and other genes in immune organs of broilers, thereby affecting the development of immune organs, the expression of various cytokines and the transduction of immune signals, improving the immune capacity of broilers. et al.

Among them, JCHAIN, PRDX1 and CDK6 were significantly upregulated in both organs, while IPO7 and RPS3 were significantly down-regulated. In our previous study, JCHAIN was also significantly up-regulated in the spleen [16] . JCHAIN protein (Joining chain of multimeric IgA and IgM) is a glycoprotein that can initiate polymerization by linking to homocysteine in the tail of IgM and IgA and bind to poly IgM and IgA stably by isulfide bonds, and JCHAIN plays an important role in the secretion and transport of immunoglobulin, and the activation of complement [17, 18] . JCHAIN protein has highly conserved structural characteristics in various vertebrates and invertebrates. It has been found that the amino acid composition of JCHAIN protein in chicken and human is highly similar [19] . Some scholars have studied the expression level of JCHAIN in adult chicken brain, intestine, thymus, spleen, bursa of fabricius and other tissues and organs, and found that the expression level in spleen and rectum was higher, while the expression level in thymus is lower [20] . In addition, some studies have shown that Lactobacillus bulgaricus can activate lymphocytes, synthesize IgA dimer through JCHAIN, and significantly increase the level of sIgA in breast milk and feces of lactating women [21] . In this experiment, the expression of JCHAIN in the immune organs of broilers increased significantly after feeding Bacillus cereus, which may be a positive signal for the immunity of broilers. catalytic oxidation-reduction. Therefore, PRDX1 may be a good regulator of \"H 2 O 2 \" signal [22] . Matulova et al. [23] found that PRDX1 was up-regulated in the spleen of broilers infected with Salmonella enteritidis. Lavri\u010d et al. [24] also found that the expression of PRDX1 increased after macrophages of chicken were exposed to Mycoplasma synovium or Escherichia coli. In addition, some studies have shown that the expression of PRDX1 protein in kidney of broilers decreased after infectious bronchitis coronavirus infection [25] . These two different results suggest that chickens may have different defense mechanisms in response to bacterial and viral infection, and PRDX1 may play a role in chicken resistance to bacterial infection. In this study, PRDX1 gene was up-regulated in thymus and bursa of fabricius of broiler chickens fed with probiotics. Thymus and bursa of fabricius are important places for the body to produce lymphocytes. It suggests that Bacillus cereus PAS38 may promote lymphocytes production of PRDX1 in immune organs, so as to improve the ability of organism to deal with bacterial infection. CDK6 (Cyclin-dependent kinases 6) is a cell cycle regulator, and the activity of CDK6 protein depends on its binding to Cyclins. It can combine with Cyclin D to form a complex, thus transform the cell cycle from G1 to S [26, 27] . Uras et al. [28] found that the lack of CDK6 would make red blood cells more sensitive to mechanical stress in vitro and lead to a shorter life span, which would lead to anemia in mice. Grison et al. [29] found that CDK6 deficiency could slow the proliferation of basal progenitor cells in the dorsal and ventral forebrain of mice. These studies indicate that CDK6 plays an important role in the development of organism. Meanwhile, Henrique et al. [30] found that the high expression of CDK6 in the cytoplasm of CD8 memory cells was conducive to the rapid cell division, which showed that CDK6 also played a role in the immune process. In this experiment, the expression of CDK6 in thymus and bursa of fabricius increased after broilers were fed with Bacillus cereus. Combined with previous studies, Bacillus cereus can promote the development of immune organs and increase the number of lymphocyte [6, 11] , indicating that Bacillus cereus PAS38 may achieve these effects by up regulating CDK6 gene.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 334, "end": 338, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 676, "end": 680, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 681, "end": 684, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 899, "end": 903, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1183, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1405, "end": 1409, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1699, "end": 1703, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1722, "end": 1726, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1839, "end": 1843, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2136, "end": 2140, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2950, "end": 2954, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2955, "end": 2958, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2973, "end": 2977, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3161, "end": 3165, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3409, "end": 3413, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3860, "end": 3863, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3864, "end": 3867, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gene Forward sequence (5'-3') Reverse sequence (5'-3')"}, {"text": "IPO7 (Importin-7), as a member of the nuclear adaptor protein importin-\u03b2 superfamily, is a cell transporter, which can mediate proteins, hormones and nucleic acids into the nucleus [31] .
