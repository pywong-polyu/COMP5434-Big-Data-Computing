The problem of motivation to change in the specific context of recovery from alcohol addiction was addressed by Rowicka. In this study, two measurement tools were also adapted to assess the quality of motivation to change. Designing (Poraj-Weder et al.) and validating (Poraj-Weder et al., Rowicka) research tools does not only allow a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of implementing health changes, but also a better selection of interventions.

The authors engaged in finding the predictors of the problematic viewing of TV series by young adults. The results indicate a significant relationship between anxiety-depressive syndrome and the motivation to watch TV series and problematic series viewing. Several other articles (Burnos and Skrobowski; Mierzy\u0144ska et al.) focus on intrapersonal factors that facilitate change maintenance in a group of chronically somatically ill patients and in adolescent functioning (Zawadzka et al.) . Patient engagement and adherence to medical recommendations is currently an important issue that has been addressed in many publications (Gu et al., 2021; Newman et al., 2021) . Committing to health behaviors after heart transplantation is a crucial task in view of maintaining good health and the need to follow medical advice. Mierzy\u0144ska et al. concentrate on intrapersonal factors affecting health, such as personality traits, health behaviors, self-efficacy, and a health locus of control. Among the examined resources, the best predictors of caring about health were a health locus of control and the level of conscientiousness, according to Big Five concept. Among the various forms of health-relevant habits, maintaining a healthy diet proved to be the most difficult for heart transplant patients. In turn, in the group of patients with metabolic disorders (Burnos and Skrobowski), the moderating role of personality and temperamental traits was confirmed with regard to changes in health behavior and quality of life after the application of a motivational intervention. Higher Sensory Sensitivity, lower Perseveration, and higher Agreeableness enhanced positive change in health behaviors.",

According to Dobrenko, it is advisable to choose new habits based on the needs that are currently inadequately met, including affiliation, stimulation, activity, and rhythm. These newly developed healthy habits can work to our long-term advantage once they become automatic, which requires finding a cue that will trigger a habit, developing a routine that can be habitually followed, and defining the reward).",

The distinction between health promotion and disease prevention (Tengland, 2010) seems artificial in the context of contemporary challenges and emerging disease outbreaks (Laverack, 2017) , including COVID-19. Because implementing sustainable change is difficult, research must identify the determinants of effective intervention (Conner and Norman, 2017) . There is also a need for methods to identify the motivational status of the person who undertakes change so that it can be effective and, above all, sustainable (Poraj-Weder et al., 2021) . Carrying out research in a mixed-method approach seems very promising in this context.",
