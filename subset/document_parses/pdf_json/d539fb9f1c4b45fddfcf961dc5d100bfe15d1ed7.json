Vaccine acceptance reflects the overall perception of disease risk, vaccine attitudes and demand within the general population, which is critical for the success of immunization programs to attain high vaccination coverage rates, especially for newly emerging infectious diseases [7] [8] [9] . Reports on the acceptance and uptake of pandemic vaccines, such as for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, have shown unsatisfying results, as the willingness to receive the 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine among the general public ranged from 17% to 67% across studies from Australia, America, Greece, the UK and France [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Previous studies on vaccine acceptance and theories of health behavior, such as the health belief model or protection motivation theory, have identified many factors that influence the acceptance or uptake of a pandemic vaccine, including the risk perception of the disease, perception of vaccine safety and efficacy, general vaccination attitude, past vaccination history, recommendations from doctors, price, vaccination convenience and socio-demographic characteristics [7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

            "text": "In addition to the problem of unsatisfactory acceptance, the real uptake rate of pandemic vaccines could be much lower than the acceptance after the introduction of the vaccine and promotion of mass immunization programs [12, 15, 23, 24] . For example, only 10% of the population received a vaccination at the end of the domestic H1N1 outbreak in France compared to the vaccination intention of 17% or 27.4% [12, 15, 24] . Even in high-risk populations such as healthcare workers, only 25% received the pandemic H1N1 vaccination when it was provided for free in Beijing, China [23] . The hesitancy or delay regarding vaccination was the primary reason for this discrepancy, even among those who had intended to get a vaccination [9, 10, 25, 26] . Recent articles have found that some impact factors on vaccination acceptance helped to explain vaccination hesitancy or vaccination delay behavior, and the cultural, social or political differences across countries should also be considered in the vaccination decision-making process [9, 18, 27, 28] . For novel vaccines against new emerging pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, public concern about vaccine safety was frequently identified as a serious barrier to vaccine acceptance [7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 25] , while attitudes and past history regarding vaccination-especially influenza vaccination history-were the major predictors of pandemic vaccine uptake [7, [10] [11] [12] 15, 17, 18] . As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown higher severity in terms of transmissibility and mortality compared with past pandemics of influenza, countries around the world-including China-are facing great pressure to control the current pandemic and prevent a possible recurrence of damaging waves or epidemics in the future. In this case, understanding the influencing factors of the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination and identifying common barriers and facilitators for vaccination decisions are important aspects in the design of effective strategies to improve the vaccine coverage rate among the general population [9, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .",

The Wen Juan Xing sample database covers over 2.6 million respondents, whose personal information was confirmed, allowing for an authentic, diverse and representative sample. The target population in the present study was Chinese adults living in Mainland China; thus, a random sample procedure stratified by age and location was adopted to match Chinese adults in the Wen Juan Xing sample database. Chinese respondents aged 18 years and above residing in Mainland China on the Wen Juan Xing sample database were eligible to participate in the survey. In general, 2100 respondents were randomly selected, and the final sample consisted of 2058 respondents after quality control and manual check procedures to exclude incomplete and invalid questionnaires.

The acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in China was higher than that of the H1N1 vaccine, not only in other countries and regions, which ranged from 17% to 67% [7, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , but also in China, which was estimated to have a roughly 37.3% H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccination rate [23] . This reflects the difference in public perception about the two pandemics in terms of the disease severity, infection risk, vaccine importance or attitude, as well as some macro-level factors such as social or cultural factors across countries [9, 18] . As reported in this study, the pandemic has had a profound impact on the work, income or daily life of Chinese residents. To address these challenges, China has taken drastic measures and public health interventions to control the transmission of COVID-19 since the outbreak of the disease, and these actions have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19 [32, 33, 36] . Therefore, although 74.7% of respondents reported having confirmed or suspected cases in the county in which they lived, only a small portion (12.2%) perceived a high or very high risk of the disease. In comparison, we found that Chinese residents held strong beliefs about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination, as 89.5% thought that vaccination is an effective way to prevent and control COVID-19, even though the vaccine is still under development. This positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination and the large perceived pandemic impact may explain the high acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among Chinese adults, as they perceive strong benefits from vaccination compared with the risk according to the health belief model [15, 18, 20, 21, 37, 38] . Moreover, our survey collected respondents' preferences for immunization schedules and vaccine production and found that they either preferred a routine immunization schedule (49.4%) or accepted both schedules (41.6%) and accepted both domestic and imported vaccines (64.2%). All these findings represented a good start in the process of achieving the coverage rate required to ensure herd immunity among the Chinese population, and the acceleration of COVID-19 vaccine development and listing for application for the public is therefore urged in response to the COVID-19 pandemic at this stage [4, 39] .",

            "text": "Although a high acceptance rate has been observed, there are still some barriers in the process of moving from the vaccination intention to real uptake behavior. Around half of respondents (47.8%) with vaccination intention would delay vaccination until the safety of the vaccine is confirmed, and concerns or uncertainty about vaccine safety led to their vaccine hesitation. Public concern about vaccine safety has frequently been reported as the major obstacle to vaccination decision-making, especially for newly introduced vaccines which have not been fully tested in the real world [7] [8] [9] [12] [13] [14] [17] [18] [19] 25, 27, 28] . For example, 13% of Australian people stated that they would wait to see if there were any adverse events before agreeing to get vaccinated, while their acceptance rate was as high as 67% [10] . Two reasons may explain the vaccine delay observed in this study: firstly, the vaccine against COVID-19 was still under development during the survey period, and there was no information about vaccine safety for reference; secondly, concerns about using new vaccines during a pandemic were reported to differ from those of established products in a non-crisis situation, as the uncertainties about new vaccines, new emerging infectious diseases and concerns about the pharmaceuticals would lower the vaccine confidence of the public [25] . However, the hesitancy that our study reported may be reduced later, when a vaccine becomes available, as a quantitative study in Dutch reported that, once the safety of newly-introduced vaccines becomes comparable to that of vaccines which are already on the market, the importance of this factor on vaccination decision-making becomes less than other attributes such as vaccine effectiveness or cost [22] . This also requires an increased focus on vaccine safety in the research and development of new vaccines and better performance in terms of many other vaccine attributes such as price and convenience to increase vaccine uptake, especially for those who accept vaccination but with hesitation.",

            "text": "As the majority (91.3%) of respondents had the intention of getting vaccinated, it is meaningful to identify other barriers or facilitators to their vaccination decision on whether to accept vaccination as soon as possible. The risk perception of respondents was an important predictor for vaccination acceptance, as those who perceived a high or very high risk of infection were more likely to get vaccinated as soon as possible instead of delaying it. Our study also confirmed the positive role of influenza vaccination history and belief in vaccine effectiveness in accepting immediate vaccination, which was consistent with previous studies [7, [10] [11] [12] 15, 17, 18] . Furthermore, we found that those who valued doctor's recommendations tended to get vaccinated immediately, while those who valued vaccination convenience or vaccine price in decision-making tended to choose delayed vaccination. Inconsistent results were shown in previous studies from the UK, France or Australia concerning the impact of socio-demographic characteristics on the acceptance of a pandemic vaccine [7, 12, 16, 17] , and we found that, among the Chinese population, male or married respondents were more likely to accept immediate vaccination against the pandemic, while respondents' education or income may not influence their intention. Our findings are useful for designing effective vaccination strategies and immunization programs for those with vaccine hesitancy. Firstly, the vaccine price should be affordable for the public, and it is promising that China has stated that it aims to make its COVID-19 vaccine a global public good when it is ready for application [22, 26, 40] . Secondly, measures should be taken to increase vaccine convenience and accessibility in terms of vaccine manufacture, distribution, supply, immunization service, etc. [9, 22, 27] . Last but not least, monitoring information about vaccine safety should be made public on a regular basis after the application of the vaccine, and timely health education and communication conducted by authoritative sources such as healthcare professionals will be critical to alleviate public concerns about vaccine safety [9, 27] . In response to future possible pandemics, health departments and other sectors should consider regular vaccination and education programs for established vaccines for non-pandemic infectious diseases such as influenza to improve overall vaccine confidence and the compliance of the public [9, 26, 28] . This is the first study to investigate the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among a large population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which provided baseline information for the ongoing monitoring of the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination by public. By considering the vaccine hesitancy and dividing respondents based on acceptance levels (refused, immediate or delayed acceptance), our study contributed to the comparison within countries about the influencing factors of pandemic vaccination acceptance, such as some socio-demographic characteristics. The exploration of barriers and facilitators of vaccination was useful for identifying priority groups that need special attention in the vaccination campaign and helped to design effective immunization strategies to increase the vaccine uptake in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study has several limitations. First of all, as the use of an offline survey was not feasible during the pandemic period, the online survey may limit the representativeness of the present study's sample. To address this problem, we enrolled a large sample size and used a random sampling method stratified by demographic characteristics to increase the sample diversity and representativeness. Secondly, given the hypothetical nature, the study results may differ from real practice, and some self-reported answers may lead to information bias. Further studies are needed to investigate the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in different periods of the pandemic and to take vaccine efficiency and safety into consideration after the vaccine is made available to the public.",

Concerns about vaccine safety by the public may hinder the promotion of vaccine uptake in the future. To expand vaccine uptake in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, immunization programs should be designed to remove barriers in vaccine price and vaccination convenience. In addition, health education and communication from authoritative sources will be important to alleviate public concerns about vaccine safety.",
