These characteristics are consistent with the multi-step model of disease. We applied this model to Covid-19 case fatality rates (CFRs) from China, South Korea, Italy, Spain and Japan. In all countries we found that a plot of log(CFR) against log(age) was approximately linear with a slope of about 5. We also conducted similar analyses for selected other respiratory diseases. SARS showed a similar log-log age-pattern to that of Covid-19, albeit with a lower slope, whereas seasonal and pandemic influenza showed quite different age-patterns. Thus, death from Covid-19 and SARS appears to follow a distinct age-pattern, consistent with a multi-step model of disease that in the case of Covid-19 is probably defined by comorbidities and age producing immunerelated susceptibility.",

This is in contrast with other respiratory pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus [14] and seasonal influenza [15, 16] which cause substantial numbers of deaths in children and have a J-shaped pattern with age. In contrast, pandemic influenza viruses often cause severe disease in middle-aged adults [17] [18] [19] , even without pre-existing co-morbidities [20] , suggesting different pathogenesis from that for seasonal influenza. One exception was mortality from pandemic influenza in 2009, which had a different age-distribution to other influenza pandemics [15] ; severe disease was relatively high in young adults aged 20 to 40 years, with comparatively few cases among those > 65 years of age, and appeared to be driven by a nonprotective anamnestic response to the new virus by previously acquired antibodies. Thus, there are some notable features of Covid-19 death which suggest that it has a different relationship with age than most other severe respiratory pathogens.",

Having an underlying condition such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, severe chronic respiratory disease and cancer increases the risk. However, a strong predictor of mortality after adjusting for major comorbidities is increasing age itself [9] . Furthermore, the extreme rarity of fatal outcomes in children suggests that one must have gone through a number of changes, either as a result of unknown aspects of aging, or as a result of chronic disease (effectively speeding up the aging process), which increase susceptibility, leading to severe disease and death. These characteristics of Covid-19 death are consistent with the multi-step model of disease [22] , a model which has primarily been used for cancer [23, 24] , and more recently for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [25] . If one assumes that a disease (or an outcome such as Covid-19 death) is caused in a single step process, then the incidence in a particular year will be proportional to the risk of having undergone that specific step in that year; this will depend on the level of exposure to the relevant causal factor. If it requires more than one step, then the chance of undergoing the first step by a particular age will be proportional to that age (e.g., a 60 year old is twice as likely to have gone through a particular step as a 30 year old); if there are n steps involved, then the probability that the first n \u2212 1 steps have occurred by a particular age will be proportional to age to the power of n \u2212 1: i = u 1 u 2 u 3 \u2026 u n\u22121 u n t n\u22121 where i = incidence, t = age, n = number of steps, and the u i are a series of constants.

One might question whether such a model, which assesses risk across all ages, would apply to Covid-19 death, since Covid-19 is a new disease. However, evidence to date suggests that usually a person will die from Covid-19 because they have been infected and they have one or more chronic conditions. Thus, one can conceive of the process involving the acquisition of these chronic conditions and infection with SARS-CoV-2. Briefly, if someone has already accumulated a number of the necessary steps, then they are 'primed' to have severe Covid-19 if infection occurs. If they are not 'primed', then infection can occur, but disease is usually mild. This is most obvious in children, who are unlikely to have accumulated the necessary steps, and in whom infection is almost always mild. Thus, it is plausible that the multi-step model could apply to death from Covid-19, with the early steps occurring through life-course and 'priming' an individual to have severe disease if and when they experience the final step, i.e. SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since males have a higher death rate in each age-group than females [9, 26] , we also aimed to compared the findings between sexes.",

We therefore included all ages (0-99 years) in the descriptive analyses, but restricted the multi-step analyses to ages 30 years and over (an approach that has been used in some other analyses of Covid-19 mortality [36] ). We analysed age-specific (and where available, sex-specific) death rates (i.e. CFRs and IFRs) in ten-year age-groups (for publications which reported five-year age-groups we amalgamated these into ten-year groups in order to standardize the analysis). We used the mid-point of each age-group and regressed the natural log of the CFR or IFR against the natural log of age, using standard linear least-squares regression. As in similar previous analyses [25] , we used unweighted regression so that the estimated slope was not biased towards the older age-groups where there were many more deaths. The multi-step model predicts a slight flattening of the curve in the youngest and oldest age-groups-this occurs because deaths in young age-groups often involve people who have inherited at least one step, and therefore have a high risk but a lower slope-in the oldest age-groups many people will already have accumulated 1-2 steps, so once again the risk is higher but the slope is lower [24] . For the multi-step model, we are interested in the overall slope with equal weight on all of the age-groups (essentially it is the middle age-groups which are predicted to provide the slope which is one less than the number of steps). We did the regressions for each country, by sex (data available for Spain and Italy), and we also did combined analyses adjusting for country; these were weighted by the total number of cases in each country's dataset.",

Although seasonal influenza generally showed an exponential increase with age, there were also high death rates in the 0-4 age-group (i.e. the overall pattern is J-shaped). Data on mortality in hospitalised influenza cases in England from January 2000 to August 2007 [16] , i.e. during non-pandemic years, did not clearly show a log-log pattern, and the fitted slope is only 1.4 ( Figure S8 ). Pandemic influenza (H1N1) showed a very different age-pattern, with peak mortality in adulthood. Modelling data from England [37] on mortality due to 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic shows a J-shaped pattern of mortality in the youngest age-group, with no linear log-log pattern, and the fitted slope is close to zero (Figure S9 ). SARS showed a roughly linear log-log relationship ( Figure S10 ), but with a lower slope (3.6) than was observed for Covid-19 (Fig. 2) . Thus, SARS showed a similar log-log age-pattern to that of Covid-19, albeit with a lower slope; in contrast, seasonal and pandemic influenza showed quite different age-patterns, with little evidence of a log-log relationship, and with substantially lower slopes. The log-log plot of total mortality in the Northwest Italy for the first six months of both 2019 and 2020 shown in Figure S11 indicates that Covid-19 mortality and all-cause mortality both increase markedly with age, but that there are differences in age-patterns (the pattern for total mortality appears to be non-linear-slightly J-shaped-whereas the pattern for Covid-19 mortality is linear with a slight S-shape which is predicted by the model), and in the slope of the log-log trend (total mortality has a slope of about 7, rather than the value of about 5 for Covid-19 mortality).",

            "text": "As hypothesized, we found a linear log-log relationship between the Covid-19 CFR and age, with a small flattening of the curve in the youngest and oldest age-groups (as predicted by the multi-step model [24] ). All five countries gave similar values for the overall slope (Table 1) , i.e. about 5, indicating a multi-step process of about 6 steps. As with other applications of the multi-step model (e.g. cancer), this is a population average, and it may well be that some pathways to the outcome may involve a different number of steps [24] . We have also shown a similar log-log age-pattern for SARS, albeit with a lower slope (indicating a smaller number of steps); in contrast, seasonal and pandemic influenza showed markedly different age-patterns. Thus, death from Covid-19 and SARS appears to follow a distinct age-pattern, consistent with a multi-step model of disease. A number of limitations of the data should be recognized. Firstly, the appropriate denominator depends on what the hypothesis is. For cancer, where the multi-step model has been most commonly used, the hypothesis is that there are steps involved in developing cancer, so the outcome/numerator is incidence and the denominator is total population; most risk factors for cancer that follow the multi-step model (e.g. a genetic mutation) affect incidence and usually not survival [24] . In the current context, the outcome is Covid-19 death, and the hypothesis relates to mortality in those who become infected. However, in most cases, only case fatality rates (CFRs) were available, and the denominator was diagnosed cases rather than all infections. A related problem is selective case identification-most cases are identified by testing symptomatic people, and non-symptomatic cases are largely missed, and even in those tested there will be false positive and false negative results (this is also a problem with other respiratory diseases such as pandemic influenza [30] ). Given these uncertainties, the available data that we have used for these analyses is likely to be subject to inaccuracy and misclassification (of outcome, denominator, or both). However, these uncertainties will not bias the analysis unless they operate with different strengths at different agegroups. For example, if the problem is just that the CRF is double the IFR at each age-group greater than 30 years (because at each age-group, only one-half of the infections are tested and diagnosed), this will affect the absolute value of the CFR but will not affect the slope of the log-log linear trend. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that we have obtained very similar findings for the CFR in several different populations and contexts, with differing methods for ascertaining cases.",

Clearly, this does not apply to Covid-19. Rather, we think of individuals in a population and the different 'steps' that make them more susceptible for a severe course of Covid-19 (much like the 'promotor' steps in the cancer model). In the cancer model, there are some steps which apply to all cells, e.g. when one is born with a genetic mutation. The same may apply to Covid-19, i.e. the steps involved are likely to be systemic for an individual and can be genetic. It is also possible that comorbidities, or other changes associated with the aging, may lead to increased systemic inflammation, and an exaggerated immune response. Once again, these would be systemic changes in an individual rather than changes in a single cell.",

            "text": "If we can assume that the findings presented here are valid, given all the uncertainties of the data, what do they mean? The multi-step model has been used for cancer since 1954, but with a few exceptions, the relevant stages have not yet been identified. Those that have been identified typically involve mutations in DNA or other cellular changes which lead to cell proliferation. The model has produced a number of testable hypotheses, e.g. relating to the stage (step) at which various carcinogens act [38] , the dose-response relationships for factors such as smoking, and the changes in the age-incidence patterns after smoking cessation [24] . The application of the multi-step model to ALS [25] is beginning to yield similar benefits, including clarifying the role of genetic susceptibility which increases the disease rate at each age-group but produces a lower slope compared with persons without such susceptibility [39] . Thus, recognizing diseases that show a multi-step pattern provides the foundations for identifying the steps and being able to intervene across the life-course; this includes not only attempting to prevent specific steps from happening, but also taking early therapeutic action pointed at an existing step in those who are infected. Importantly, for Covid-19, it illustrates that identification of the final steps in (elderly) patients could prevent severe disease and death. Given that SARS-Cov-2 is a newly discovered virus, it is not surprising that the stages involved in Covid-19 mortality are not currently readily identifiable. Given the rapidity of Covid-19 death following infection, it is likely that SARS-Cov-2 itself acts at a late stage of the multi-step process, with the previous stages having occurred before infection, throughout the life-course. Although it is not yet clear what these steps may be, they clearly involve changes associated with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, severe chronic respiratory disease and cancer. They also involve other cumulative changes associated with aging (e.g. one change may be the nasal expression of ACE-2 receptors with aging [40] ), since age itself is a risk factor for Covid-19 death. Collectively, these comorbidities, and age itself, appear to be markers of immune-related susceptibility, which makes the difference between experiencing a mild illness, or a severe illness possibly resulting in death. However, we and others would argue that age is not a process in and by itself, but rather that age is a surrogate variable for the accumulation of several 'steps' that leave permanent damage. What is involved in the specific steps in the model, and how they effectively 'speed up' the aging process, remains unclear. For example, why does a 60-yearold with diabetes have a similar Covid-19 mortality risk (if infected) as a 63 year old without diabetes [41]? Perhaps having obesity involves 'insults' such as systemic inflammation, and may prime someone to be more susceptible to the systemic inflammation and cytokine storms that can occur with Covid-19. If one is old enough, then this same 'insult' may occur for other 'unknown' reasons, which is why such risks increase with age.",

            "text": "In multi-step model terminology, this would mean that males were born with one step already in place, analogous to being born with a particular genetic mutation which accounts for one step of a multi-step cancer process. In this scenario, males would have higher death rates at each age-group, but their overall age slope would be one lower, since one step had already been acquired at birth. We found that the male CFR was higher than that in females at each age-group, but that the slope of the regression was 0.7 lower in males. This is close to the difference of 1.0, which was the a priori hypothesis. We propose that this step may be related to a relative deficiency in innate immune responses to viruses in males compared to females. Recent analysis in a populationbased birth cohort has shown that interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03b3 responses to three common respiratory viruses and two viral mimics are deficient in males compared to females, indicating that the excess Covid-19 mortality in males is likely at least in part explained by impaired innate anti-viral immune responses in males compared to females (Prof S Johnston, personal communication). Endosomal-expressed Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7/8/9 are engaged by positive strand RNA viruses such SARS-CoV-2, which require endosomal processing as part of viral entry into cells [43] . Their activation results in production of type I IFNs, which is an important step for the induction of antiviral immunity. TLRs 7 and 8 are encoded by loci on X chromosome locus, and biallelic expression of X-linked genes could enhance TLR7-8 expression in female immune cells [44] , thereby providing a mechanistic explanation for our observation. We propose that the notion that biallelic expression of X-linked TLR7-8 is unlikely to be strictly binary, and will not occur in every female, could explain the 0.7 (rather than 1.0) difference.",

These findings are consistent with a multistep model of disease involving a six-step process that in the case of SARS-COV-2 is probably defined by comorbidities and age producing immune-related susceptibility. It is also striking that we see a similar pattern with SARS (another Coronavirus), perhaps indicating a similar mechanism for mortality, whereas we see different age-patterns for other severe respiratory infections, perhaps indicating that different mechanisms are operating. The clear log-log patterns of the CFR rate with age that we have identified indicate that there is a potential to identify population subgroups which are 'primed' for severe disease if they experience a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
