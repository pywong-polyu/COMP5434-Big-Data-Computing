The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 and the American Heart Association recommend delaying the introduction of added sugar until age 2. The aims of this study were to identify the timing of added sugar initiation; factors associated with added sugar initiation; and the top five added sugar foods and beverages consumed by infants and children at three age ranges (<7 months, 8-13 months, and 14-24 months). Data were from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study-2, a longitudinal, national population of WIC participants enrolled in WIC eligible clinics (n = 3835). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the factors associated with introducing added sugar. About 25% of children were given added sugar at or before 7 months. Contributing factors were caregivers' race/ethnicity, education, employment, weight status, parity, child sex, and premature birth (all p < 0.05). The top added sugar foods consumed between 1-24 months were cereal, crackers, apple sauce, dessert, yogurt, sweetened beverages, syrup and preserves, and cookies. Further research to examine the impact of early initiation of added sugar on health outcomes and taste preferences is warranted.",

            "text": "Research on this topic is sparse. Thus, it is not known how much added sugar children aged 2 years and younger consume and when added sugar was introduced. To our knowledge, there have only been three studies in this area. Herrick and colleagues conducted a cross-sectional study among 1211 children from birth to 23 months old in the US. The researchers found that those aged 12 to 23 months consumed more added sugar per day compared to infants aged birth to <12 months (5.8 vs. 0.9 teaspoons); about 84% of infants and toddlers consumed added sugar on a given day [10] . Au et al. (2018) conducted an observational study to estimate the diet quality among 5955 Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) participant children aged 7 to 24 months. Using the Healthy Eating Index, the authors found that added sugar intake increased as children increased in age from 13 to 24 months [12] . Wang et al. (2018) conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the intake and sources of added sugar, saturated fats, and sodium among non-breastfeeding children aged 5 years and younger in the US. The researchers found that added sugar consumption increased rapidly among infants, from birth to 12 months old, and then more gradually up to the age of 2 years, with the lowest consumption among infants and toddlers born to women with higher income [13] . There is also a lack of research documenting the sources of added sugar foods that children under the age of 2 years consume. Herrick and colleagues (2020) found that the common sources of added sugar intake were yogurt, baby food snacks, and sweet bakery products for infants and fruit drinks and sweet bakery products for toddlers [8] ; Wang et al. (2018) identified that the common sources of added sugar among children 5 years and younger were cakes/cookies/pastries/pies, sweets, and fruit juice drinks or fruit-flavored drinks [13] .",

To determine the variables to keep in the adjusted model, we conducted a bivariate analysis. We kept those that were significant in the bivariate analysis in the adjusted model. We also compared hazard ratios and confidence intervals for the unadjusted and adjusted regression models to assess any meaning changes that could arise due to associations among the independent variables. There were no major statistically significant changes in the hazard ratios, indicating there was no evidence of any meaningful changes.

Herrick et al. conducted a cross-sectional analysis among infants and toddlers using data from the nationally representative US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

The professional nutrition and health community, specifically the American Heart Association and The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, recommends that added sugar should not be included in the diet until the age of 2 years; limiting added sugar intake to less than 10%of calories per day starting at the age of 2 years is recommended to reduce the risk of related morbidities [24] .

Our study results suggest that women with lower-income and less education may be more likely to initiate added sugar into the diets of infants and toddlers. Healthcare professionals and WIC nutritionists can be useful resources to communicate information about the adverse effects of added sugar initiation at an early age. Moreover, intervention is needed to educate the caregivers about the negative health outcomes associated with added sugar consumption at an early age.

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recognize the importance of evidence-based research and strategies to reduce added sugar intake at a young age. Therefore, evidence-based and theory-based intervention is needed to understand strategies to reduce added sugar intake. Moreover, there remains a lack of research in this area. First, further research is needed to understand the association between added sugar intake during infancy and the preference for added sugar among young children, and if the association has long-term health consequences later in life. Second, qualitative research is needed to understand caregivers' behaviors associated with introducing added sugar to infants and young children, to understand the degree to which caregivers are aware of the food items that contain added sugar, and to understand if caregivers are aware of the adverse effects of added sugar consumption at young ages. Third, it is important to understand the patterns of added sugar consumption, specifically the variations in volume and frequency of added sugar intake and to examine whether different added sugar intake patterns influence growth and health outcomes. Fourth, future research to better understand why women in some sub-groups initiate early added sugar more than others would be useful. Fifth, it would be useful for future research to examine if the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with changes in added sugar consumption among children. Lastly, it is noteworthy to mention that when the WIC ITFPS-2 interviews began in July 2013, there were no formal recommendations about added sugar intake for infants and children from birth to 2 years old. The American Heart Association provided its recommendations in 2017 [2] and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans provided its recommendations in December 2020 [4] . Thus, it would be useful to extend this research in the future to understand the timing of added sugar initiation after these recommendations were made [25, 26] .",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the initiation of added sugar intake and to identify the factors associated with the initiation of added sugar intake among a national population of WIC participants. The study findings are generalizable to low-income populations in the US enrolled in WIC. Our study is also the first to examine three age ranges of infants and toddlers. We also explored several other factors that have not been considered in the existing related research that were found as potential risk factors for the initiation of added sugar at an early age.",

While this method is widely used to identify food, energy, and nutrient intake it also has limitations. The 24-h recall method depends on participants' memory; participants may not accurately recall food consumption. Moreover, since the information about added sugar initiation is self-reported, response bias is possible. Finally, the study was conducted among the WIC population. Thus, the study findings are not generalizable to the US population of children.",

The contributing factors associated with added sugar intake at three age ranges among infants and young children include race/ethnicity, income, education, parity, and child sex. Considering the adverse effect of added sugar, it would be useful to better understand the added sugar intake behavior and added sugar feeding behavior among children and caregivers and how this behavior may influence children's diet quality and their development of eating behavior later in life. The study results indicate a need for health care advocacy programs and intervention to educate caregivers to stop or limit added sugar consumption among infants and children aged 2 or younger.",
