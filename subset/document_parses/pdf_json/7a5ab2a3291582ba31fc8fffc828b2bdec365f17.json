The HFGCs slowly adopted governance strategies in the times of COVID 19 pandemics because were unprepared.

The benefits of governance can be achieved through having effective, accountable and more inclusive governance institutions. Lower and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) have applied various policies to strengthen governance at PHC. The common policy that is being applied in LMICs is decentralization through various types such as fiscal, administrative and political decentralization [3] , [4] . Decentralization policy allows the transfer of administrative, fiscal and decision-making powers and responsibilities to the subnational governing entity for overseeing health service delivery. At the primary health care facilities, decentralization has created community governance structures known as Health Facility",

Kilimanjaro region was selected because is among the region with high health facilities and HFGCs performance as per the Star Rating Assessment conducted by the Presidents Office-Regional Administration and Local Government of Tanzania in all primary health facilities 2018 [27] . Songwe region was selected because is among the region with low health facilities and HFGCs performance as per the star rating assessment conducted in 2018. An inductive approach was used because it involves analyzing collected data with little or no predetermined theory for the study. This is because the governance of COVID-19 is a new phenomenon, therefore, no theory explains how COVID-19 should be governed. Therefore the actual data collected from the sites determined the analysis of the data. An inductive approach was adopted despite being time-consuming because it offers a lot where the phenomenon studied is new and not known.",

Two councils were then selected from each region, some factors determined their selection. In Kilimanjaro, Moshi Municipal was selected because was the council with low health facilities and HFGCs performance but also in the urban local authority. Siha district council was selected because is the top performer countrywide as per the star rating assessment conducted in 2018 but also is the rural local authority.

From each council, two high-performing health facilities and two lowperforming primary health facilities were selected. Before the selection, the health facilities were grouped into two categories the health centers and dispensaries. Therefore from each council, a high-performing health center and dispensary were selected. Also, a low-performing health center and dispensary were purposively selected. From each selected health facility, respondents were drawn. The selection criteria were based on the ability of the respondents to provide relevant information about the governance of health facilities during COVID-19. Therefore, all members of HFGCs were selected for FGDs and only HFGCs Chairpersons of the selected primary health facilities implementing DHFF qualified for interviews. A total number of 14 interviews were conducted until the saturation point and FGDs were conducted to the saturation point. Saturation was reached when the participant started to provide a similar response and no new information was added. Each FGD consisted of 6 to 9 participants who are members of the HFGCs. The highest number of participants was 9 because the total number of HFGC members is 9 for health centers and 8 for dispensaries.",

Shortage of resources such as finance also was found to be the major impediment that influenced HFGC's dilemma to adopt some of the governance strategies. This result is in line with the arguments raised by some literature that health system unpreparedness during the rise of COVID-19 was predicted to negatively impact the fight against the pandemic [28] - [30] . Despite all the setbacks, HFGCs to the large extent played their part by ensuring the availability of basic things health facilities such as PPE, masks and sanitizers. Through the mobilization of stakeholders and resources that governance initiatives helped to fill the gap of shortage of funding in primary health facilities as medical commodities and medicines required were obtained. This is also in line with [15] who stated the importance of collective efforts among health stakeholders in dealing with the COVID 19.",

This is because HFGCs have been found to have struggled a lot to make decisions that are within their ambits. In some health facilities, HFGCs were reluctant to make decisions that are part of their functions because they were not aware of that. This was predicted by [30] that delay in deciding and instituting appropriate measures by government entities and health managers would put more risk to the lives and death of community members and health workers. We argue that HFGCs and other governance institutions can only make appropriate decisions if they are prepared enough on how they should use and accomplish their devolved powers and responsibilities [31] - [33] . More exciting, before the implementation of DHFF, HFGCs had limited powers to initiate any intervention to be implemented in the health facilities because such powers were vested to the Council level and primary health care level. However, after the decentralization of fiscal and decision-making powers through DHFF to the primary health care facilities, some of the HFGCs are found to be enjoying their mandates and powers through initiating several interventions to protect their communities and health workers. However, other HFGCs are not yet to use such powers and mandates as has been revealed in this study. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

In the COVID 19 context, HFGCs have played their part to some extent as was expected though there is a long way to go. Indeed, the DHFF arrangement has empowered HFGCs to come out with several interventions such as financial allocation and planning that could not be possible initiated prior to DHFF implementation [5] , [37] . As suggested by [1], [38] frequently strengthening governance institutions are fundamental for proving relevant governance decisions in times of pandemics. This is the impact of DHFFin the decisions that have been made by some of the health facilities in addressing the COVID 19 pandemic. COVID 19 being a novel disease in the World and so in LMICs, it has caused many effects to the health workers, communities and health system in general [7] , [39] . At the primary health care facilities, the situation has been worse despite enormous efforts that are being directed to combat the pandemic. This is because in LMICs there was a lack of preparation of primary health care governance organs responsible for making decisions to combat the pandemic [40] . The governance of the primary health care facilities is significantly needed now than ever because of the decisions that HFGCs have to make to combat COVID 19. Since primary health facilities can ",
