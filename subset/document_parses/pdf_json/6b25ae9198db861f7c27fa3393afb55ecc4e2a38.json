Introducing and adjusting such policy measures depends on a judgement in balancing continued transmission potential with the multidimensional consequences of interventions. It is therefore critical to inform the implementation of policy measures with a clear and timely understanding of ongoing epidemic dynamics [3, 4] .",

However, any interpretation of their behaviour needs to reflect these biases and lags and is best done in combination with the other indicators. One approach that allows this in a principled manner is to use the different data sets to separately track the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, the average number of secondary infections generated by each new infected person [5] . Because Rt quantifies changes in infection levels, it is independent of the level of overall ascertainment as long as this does not change over time or is explicitly accounted for [6] . At the same time, the underlying observations in each data source may result from different lags from infection to observation. However, if these delays are correctly specified then transmission behaviour over time can be consistently compared via estimates of Rt.",

Alternatively, Rt can be estimated via mechanistic models which explicitly compartmentalise the disease transmission cycle into stages from susceptible through exposed, infectious and recovered [13, 14] . This can include accounting for varying population structures and context-specific biases in observation processes, before fitting to a source of observed cases. Across all methods, key parameters include the time after an infection to the onset of symptoms in the infecting and infected, and the source of data used as a reference point for earlier transmission events [15, 16] .",

This package implements a Bayesian latent variable approach using the probabilistic programming language Stan [26] , which works as follows. The initial number of infections were estimated as a free parameter with a prior based on the initial number of cases, hospital admissions or deaths, respectively. For each subsequent time step, previous imputed infections were summed, weighted by an uncertain generation time probability mass function, and combined with an estimate of Rt to give the prevalence at time t [11] . These infection trajectories were mapped to reported case counts by convolving over an uncertain incubation period and report delay distribution [24] , and a negative binomial observation model combined with a multiplicative day of the week effect (with an independent effect for each day of the week).Temporal variation was controlled using an approximate Gaussian process [27] with a squared exponential kernel. The length scale and magnitude of the kernel were estimated during model fitting. Each region was fitted independently using Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Eight chains were used with a warmup of 1,000 samples and 2,000 samples post warmup. Convergence was assessed using the R hat diagnostic [24, 26] .",

From mid-April to June, national estimates of Rt from test-positive cases remained around the same level as those from admissions or deaths, while after this, cases diverged to a higher steady state ( figure 1A) . On the 23rd May, the median Rt from cases matched that of deaths at 0.83 (both with 90% CrIs 0.78-0.89), but this was followed by a 78 day period before the two estimates were again comparable, on 8th August. Over this period the median Rt from cases was on average 14% higher (95%CI 12-15%). Meanwhile, the share of test-positive cases under age 50 increased from under onequarter of cases in the week of 28 March (24%, N=16,185), to accounting for nearly three-quarters of cases by 22nd August (77%, N=6,733) . While the percentage of test-positive cases aged 20-49 increased consistently from April to August, the 0-19 age group experienced a rapid increase over mid-May through July, increasing by a mean 1% each week over May 9th through August 1st (from 4% of 18,774 cases to 14.8% of 5,017 cases). is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

This was followed by the observed age distribution of all test-positive cases becoming increasingly younger, while the age distribution of admissions remained approximately level.

This may have reflected the known widespread regional outbreaks in care homes, with an older population who are more likely to experience fatal outcomes, and less likely to appear for community testing or in hospital admissions, than the general population [38] [39] [40] Our analysis was limited where data or modelling assumptions did not reflect underlying differences in transmission. Rt estimates can become increasingly uncertain and unstable with lower case counts. Further, estimated unobserved infections were mapped to reported cases or deaths using two uncertain delay distributions: the time from infection to test in the community or hospital, and a longer delay from infection to death. A mis-specified delay distribution would have created bias in the temporal distribution of all resulting Rt estimates, with estimated dates of infection and Rt, incorrectly shifted too much or little in time compared to the true infection curve. This may have been observed in the Rt variation from admissions and deaths, which often showed comparable levels and patterns in oscillations over time but were out of phase with each other. This is likely, where due to a lack of England specific data we used delays from a worldwide linelist to specify the delay to any positive test as the same as that to admission, while the delay to death was estimated separately from UK data.",
