Few studies have analyzed the use of eldercare services for PlwD. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between demographic factors (age, sex, cohabiting status) and the use of municipal eldercare services (including both home care and residential care) for older adults with dementia compared to older adults without dementia in Sweden. Methods: This study used several nationwide Swedish registers targeting all individuals aged 65 and above living in Sweden in 2014 and still alive 31st of March 2015 (n = 2,004,409). The primary outcomes variables were different types of eldercare service, and all participants were clustered based on age, sex, cohabiting status, and dementia diagnosis. In addition to descriptive statistics, we performed multivariate logistic regression models for binary outcomes and linear regression models for continuous outcomes.",

However, it was also found that a substantial proportion of men and women with dementia did not receive any eldercare services.",

The Swedish eldercare is divided into two main forms: residential and home care services. Home care services cover home help and personal care, meals on wheels, day care service, short-term and respite care, and guide service [2, 14] . Besides that, assistive technology is an emerging form of home care service includes safety alarms and walking aids etc. [2, 15] . Depending on individual needs, home care services can be offered around the clock. Residential care, on the other hand, refers to receiving institutional care in a long-term residential setting that includes nursing home care (e.g., medical needs, dementia care, terminal illness) and care for individuals who require assistance beyond the usual scope (e.g., special housing including all home care services) [16, 17] . In the Swedish eldercare PlwD are not defined as a special group and are assessed according to the same standards as other eligible persons.

Research also showed that the use of home care service is relatively more common among PlwD that are living alone or are resident in rural municipalities compared to PlwD that are cohabiting or are living in urban areas [2, 37, 38] . However, how demographic factors like age, sex, and cohabitation status affect eldercare services for PlwD are fairly under-studied.",

As expected, the results from the logistic regression models confirmed that age is a significantly strong predictor for any kind of eldercare, also when adjusted for sex, education, health (hospital nights), cohabitation status, region, and the number of years with dementia (see Table 3 ). Compared with the reference category, that is, men 65-69 years old, all other age groups showed higher odds for receiving eldercare, both among women and men. The same was true for both residential care and home care services. Notable is that the age effect seems to be stronger among people without a dementia diagnosis, shown by very high odds ratios in the oldest age groups. Regarding hours of home care services, the patterns are different. While age seems to have a positive effect on the hours of home care services for both women and men with dementia, age seems to be negatively associated with hours of home care services among women and men without dementia.

            "text": "First, our results show that older age is a significantly strong predictor for any kind of eldercare. In addition, in the younger age groups the proportion women and men that received eldercare services was similar, while a slightly higher proportion of women compared with men received eldercare services in older age groups, in particular from the age of 80-84. A similar finding has been reported by Zielinski and Halling [46] who found that women, especially if aged above 80 years, are more likely to receive home care services compared to men in the same age group. We also found that age is a stronger predictor of receiving eldercare services among people without a dementia diagnosis. This is probably explained by the fact that people living with dementia start to have eldercare earlier and to a higher degree, while people without dementia start to have eldercare later in life. The findings further indicate that age impacts positively on the hours of home care services for people with dementia. This fits with previous findings by Wimo et al. [47] , and Bakker et al., [24] who found that older age is associated with more use of care hours in advanced dementia stages. Second, as already mentioned, sex differences seem to be related to age and older women tend to receive more eldercare than men in accordance with several other studies that have shown that Swedish women receive and use eldercare services to a larger extent than Swedish men [11, 27] . Among people living with dementia, a similar pattern was found: in the age group 85-89 years women had 6 % units higher chances of getting home care services than men. This result corresponds to the findings in a Canadian study [48] , although a German study found that home care supports were twice as common for men with dementia than women [49] . Further, it was also found that men with dementia who live alone are more likely than women living alone to have eldercare. A recent study has identified that living alone is the most influential factor in eldercare-receipt for older men who also have less access to formal care services [11] .",

That is, people with dementia diagnosis have a higher chance to get eldercare, home care services in particular, compared to people who do not have dementia. Similar findings were found in previous studies where the authors reported that eldercare services were granted to a greater extend to people with cognitive impairment compared to those who did not have a cognitive impairment [30, 34] . This seems to be in line with a European study which showed that access to and use of dementiaspecific eldercare services is highly dependent on disease severity along with age, sex, cohabiting status, and region of residence [23] . The number of home help hours and amount of eldercare services for PlwD vary from the time of first diagnosis to the end-of life stage. In other words, as the disease progresses, PlwD will have complex eldercare demands in daily life activities that might need special consideration.",

First, although the Swedish national health care register is reliable in detecting dementia cases due to its high quality, completeness, and long history [52, 53] some information about individuals living with a dementia diagnosis might be missing. Thus, a main limitation of this study is that we only have data about dementia diagnosis provided by hospital clinics but not about dementia diagnosis provided by the physicians in healthcare centers (V\u00e5rdcentraler). Second, the cross-sectional design of the study, i.e., where we only consider eldercare services for one month, limits our chances to identify any changes in elderly care use. In addition, using data from only one month also increases the risk for over or under-reporting eldercare service use for some individuals, which could be a result of changes in eldercare services that have not yet been registered. On the other hand, we have no reason to believe that any potential reporting problem should be non-random. Third, information about dementia diagnosis in the National Patient Register (NPR) might be incomplete due to the fact that people in residential care that develop dementia might not be properly diagnoses. Despite this limitation dementia diagnosis in NPR is shown reliable (very high specificity and moderate sensitivity) and the detection rate has improved significantly during the last decades [53] .",

Without knowing to what extent, a person is in need of eldercare, we cannot say anything about fairness or inequality in the eldercare provision. Although we added hospital night as a proxy for health, which proved to be strongly correlated with eldercare services, we can only describe differences in eldercare use between groups, not evaluate if these differences are due to actual differences in need or not, that is, if the eldercare system is working as it should. In other words, we did not have independent measurement about needs of care. We discussed in general terms based on the assumption that the older person with dementia probably has greater needs of care compared to the older person without dementia diagnosis.",

However, it is noticeable that a substantial part of people with a dementia diagnosis does not have any eldercare at all, even in the older age groups. This particular group of people need special attention by the research community which can be done by developing explorative research on them. There is also a need for investigating whether the available eldercare services fit with the needs of PlwD. Finally, our study findings have policy implication as well. In Sweden, the dementia care policy primarily focuses on residential care whereas regulations related to home care services are limited. Our study findings will contribute to the existing gap in dementia care policy in Sweden since there are a considerable number of people living with dementia in their homes without any eldercare at all. We further suggest that more research be conducted to explore why older adults with dementia do not receive eldercare and what are the possible associating predictors of their care outcome.",
