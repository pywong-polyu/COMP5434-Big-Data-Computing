The origin of coronaviruses and the risks of human-to-human, animal-to-human, and human-to-animal transmission of coronaviral infections can be understood only on a broader evolutionary level by detailed comparative studies. In this paper, we studied ribonucleocapsid assembly-packaging signals (RNAPS) in the genomes of all seven known pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 and compared them with RNAPS in the genomes of the related animal coronaviruses including SARS-Bat-CoV, MERS-Camel-CoV, MHV, Bat-CoV MOP1, TGEV, and one of camel alphacoronaviruses. RNAPS in the genomes of coronaviruses were evolved due to weakly specific interactions between genomic RNA and N proteins in helical nucleocapsids. Combining transitional genome mapping and Jaccard correlation coefficients allows us to perform the analysis directly in terms of underlying motifs distributed over the genome. In all coronaviruses RNAPS were distributed quasi-periodically over the genome with the period about 54 nt biased to 57 nt and to 51 nt for the genomes longer and shorter than that of SARS-CoV, respectively. The comparison with the experimentally verified packaging signals for MERS-CoV, MHV, and TGEV proved that the distribution of particular motifs is strongly correlated with the packaging signals. We also found that many motifs were highly conserved in both characters and positioning on the genomes throughout the lineages that make them promising therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of encapsidation can affect the recombination and co-infection as well.",

            "text": "The long (about 30,000 nt) non-segmented plus-sense single-stranded RNA genome of the coronaviruses is packaged within a filament-like helical nucleocapsid, while the whole ribonucleocapsid is packaged within a membrane envelope with spike glycoproteins (Chang et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2007; Gui et al., 2017; Masters, 2019; Neuman & Buchmeier, 2016) . The nucleocapsid (N) proteins of coronaviruses provide one of the promising therapeutic targets as they are critical for viral replication and assembly and can be attributed to the most conserved proteins (Bai et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2014; Dinesh et al., 2020; Dutta et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2021; Kwarteng et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020; Matsuo, 2021; Peng et al., 2020; Tilocca et al., 2020; Yadav et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Zinzula et al., 2021) . The cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revealed that the ribonucleocapsid of SARS-CoV is helical with an outer diameter of 16 nm and an inner diameter of 4 nm (Chang et al., 2014) . The turn of the nucleocapsid is composed of two octamers polymerized from dimeric N proteins (Chen et al., 2007) . The pitch for the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid is 14 nm. The packaging of the SARS-CoV ssRNA genome near internal surface of helical nucleocapsid with such parameters should correspond to 54-56 nt per helical turn (or 6.75-7 nt per N protein) (Chang et al., 2014; Chechetkin & Lobzin, 2020) . The parameters of the ribonucleocapsid for murine hepatitis virus (MHV) are close to those of SARS-CoV (Gui et al., 2017) in accordance with evolutionary conservation of the main structural characteristics of N proteins. Due to the transitional symmetry of a helix, the weakly specific cooperative interaction between ssRNA and nucleocapsid proteins should lead to the natural selection of specific quasi-periodic motifs in the related genomic sequences. Indeed, the quasi-periodic motifs with the period close to 54 nt were detected and appeared to be strongly pronounced in the genomes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Chechetkin & Lobzin, 2020) . The ribonucleocapsid assembly/packaging signals (RNAPS) in RNA genomes together with variations in N protein conformations ensure the specificity of encapsidation. In this paper we studied RNAPS in the genomes of the known endemic and pandemic human coronaviruses and compared them with RNAPS for a batch of related genomes for animal coronaviruses. The analysis of RNAPS is performed directly in terms of underlying motifs distributed over the genome and in the context of the general genome organization. Such RNAPS may serve for therapeutic targeting or for the assessment of evolutionary divergence between the viruses. They may also shed additional light on the mechanisms of recombination and co-infection for human coronaviruses as well as on the basic problems of viral molecular evolution.",

The primary objects in our approach are correlational motifs. Generally, they cannot be reduced to the sparse or tandem repeats with gaps and alignments. As periodic features produce decaying or persistent oscillations in correlational motifs separated by distances multiple to the period, the periodic features can also be detected by the suggested method. The method can detect and reconstruct tandem repeats (both complete and incomplete) as well. The distribution of correlational motifs over the genome provides information about large-scale genome organization. As the correlational motifs are approximately robust with respect to point mutations and indels, they are especially suitable for the study of viral genomes with inherent high frequency of mutations. The characteristic correlational and quasi-repeating motifs can be used, e.g., for therapeutic targeting, for subtyping of viruses or for the assessment of evolutionary divergence between species.",

Let a nucleotide N m,\u03b1 of the type \u03b1 be positioned at a site m of the genomic sequence. Then, a pair of s-neighbors, N m-s and N m+s , is searched for around N m,\u03b1 . The nucleotide N m,\u03b1 will be retained if it has at least one s-neighbor N m-s,\u03b1 or N m+s,\u03b1 of the same type and be replaced by void otherwise (denoted traditionally by hyphen). All s-neighbors of the same type, N m-s,\u03b1 or/and N m+s,\u03b1 , should also be retained. The separation distance s is called the step of TAMGI. The resulting sequence after TAMGI with the step s is composed of the nucleotides of four types (A, C, G, T) and the hyphens \"-\" denoting voids. We will call such sequences TAMGI components and denote as s \u0393 , whereas the whole genomic sequence will be denoted as \u0393.

By definition, the complete words are non-overlapping. At the next stage, the mismatches with hyphens to the complete words can be studied.

The quasi-periodic character of the deviations \u03ba 54\u00d7k (k = 1, 2, ...) is clearly seen in Fig. 1A in accordance with the previous results (Chechetkin & Lobzin, 2020) . The characteristic top ranked deviations are marked explicitly by arrows. The JC deviations shown on the right display the TAMGI motifs coordinated with those for s = 54. The motifs for the steps s 2 corresponding to the higher JC at s 1 = 54 can be called co-evolving to the motifs associated with s 1 = 54. As expected for quasiperiodic motifs with the period about p = 54, the highest Jaccard correlations are observed for s 2 = 108 (see Fig. 1A , right). The association with the octamer units corresponding to a half of period or s 2 = 27 is four grades lower, i.e. relatively weak. The characteristic values s 2 associated with the pronounced JC deviations are shown by arrows. As discussed in Section 2.2, the superimposed TAMGI motifs yield contribution into the generation of motifs corresponding to the sum and absolute difference of their steps.",

The same concerns the motifs with s 2 = 63 and s 2 = 9 because 63-9=54. The multiplication of the motifs with s 2 = 9 may also provide a contribution to the motifs with s 1 = 54, as 9\u00d76=54. Other combinations such as 45+63, 21+87, 9+99 provide a contribution to the motifs with the doubled period, 2p = 108. Modification of motifs during quasi-random molecular evolution makes the periodic patterns for s = 54 fuzzy. Indeed, significant correlations between patterns for s 1 = 54 and s 2 = 51 or 57 as well as the correlations with s 2 = 105 are also seen in Fig. 1A , right. The comparison with the cryo-EM data (Chang et al., 2014) indicates that the motifs for s = 54 should be associated with the packaging signals, whereas the motifs for s = 51, 57, 105, 45, 9 (via 45+9 or 9\u00d76), 87, 21, and 99 can be associated in part with the assembly signals. Such multi-channel participation of the assembly signals ensures the higher rate of encapsidation.",

The Pearson correlations between counterpart profiles for all k-mers and for k-mers with k \u2265 5 were about 0.6-0.7. The corresponding peaks and troughs on the profiles may indicate the involvement of related motifs in the particular regulation mechanisms (cf. the comparison of such features with the experimentally verified examples below). Interestingly, the profile for k \u2265 5 and s = 9 revealed the highest peak in the region of the gene coding for N protein in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (windows #267 and 268 in Fig. 2B ). The binding of N proteins with this region might autocontrol the expression of the gene coding for N protein via a feedback loop. The profiles for all three lineage B coronaviruses display pronounced peaks within region of the gene coding for S protein (windows #200-220 in Fig. 2 ).

We studied also coincidences of 6-mer motifs for the counterpart steps in the different genomes (Supplement S3). We restricted ourselves to the complete coincidences and to the coincidences up to one mismatch. In the latter case the complete coincidences were discarded. The complete coincidences included also the self-coincidences (i.e. each motif was counted at least once). Each pair of coincident motifs with different positions on the genome was counted once. It was found within such a scheme that more than a half of motifs for HCoV-229E and camel \u03b1-CoV were completely coincident. The pair-wise complete coincidences for the other alphacoronaviruses were at the level 10-20%. The complete coincidences were commonly the lowest between motifs for TGEV and the other four viruses, with the minimum of coincidences for the steps s = 51 and 54 associated with the packaging periodicity.

The vocabulary of motifs and their positioning in the genome can be conveniently assessed against the annotated genomic sequences and specialized data bases (Ibrahim et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2016) .

This region is within the gene coding for nsp3 for all coronaviruses. The long stretches with tandem repeats are simultaneously a source of a variety of correlation TAMGI motifs which can participate in the different molecular mechanisms (see Fig. 8B , Supplement S3 and general discussion by Chechetkin & Lobzin (2021) ). Though the region with such tandem repeats is inherent only to HCoV-HKU1, the peaks in the corresponding regions were also found for the profiles of motifs throughout all coronaviruses (see Figs. 2, 5, 8, and 11) . These peaks were pronounced in the motif profiles for s = 54 associated with the period of helical nucleocapsid for the most pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, whereas for MERS-CoV the pronounced peak in this region was for s = 105. Targeting of the quasi-repeating motifs in both genomic RNA or/and related proteins should be more efficient because of the larger statistical weight of such motifs that makes nsp3 a promising therapeutic target.",

All experiments and the results of our bioinformatic analysis indicate that the specific recognition between the genomic RNA and M/N proteins is needed for the proper transport of RNA into the membrane envelope and encapsidation. In the case of recombinant genome such a recognition should be between RNA from the fragment I and M/N proteins translated from the fragment II. It should be expected that the efficient RNA transport, encapsidation and turnover of the whole virus life cycle need that homology between the fragments II of the virus genome and/or the similarity between structures of M/N proteins before and after recombination ought to exceed some threshold needed to make fuzzy the friend-or-foe recognition between the RNA and M/N proteins after recombination. In some cases the 3'-end may also affect the efficiency of packaging (Morales et al., 2013; Yang & Leibowitz, 2015) . This means that a recombinant virus should be suboptimal (if viable) from the packaging point of view in the overwhelming majority of cases. The recombinant virus can be adopted and selectively optimized during subsequent evolution or be extinct (Jensen & Lynch, 2020; Vignuzzi & L\u00f3pez, 2019) . A part of the pronounced peaks for the motif profiles in the region of the gene coding for S protein may be related to recombination. As is seen from Figs. 2, 5, 8, and 11, this feature is typical of the coronavirus genomes.",

The first, more general, level of characterization of viral genomes comprises the ranked TAMGI deviations and the study of mutual relationships between them by JC. These characteristics remained mainly reproducible within the same lineage of the coronaviruses but differed between the lineages. The second, more specific, level of characterization is related to the repertoires of longer TAMGI motifs (typically with k \u2265 5-6), their sequential ordering and distribution over the genome. In this form, the TAMGI-JC technique can be applied to the assessment of the evolutionary divergence between viruses and to the problem of subtyping. The application of the TAMGI motifs to the subtyping of viruses is close to the general discriminant genomic analysis with k-mers (Ounit et al., 2015; Tomovi\u0107 et al., 2006) . Motifs reconstructed by TAMGI can also be used for the assessment of the mutation impact and for therapeutic targeting. Further progress in the study of (multi)functional role of TAMGI motifs can be achieved by the additional experimental work. The vocabulary of functional motifs for the coronaviruses is of basic interest and can help in the practical medical applications.",

Nevertheless, the positioning of the longer coincident RNAPS with k \u2265 7 was close as well, e.g., TTTGACC (with the start sites, respectively, at 12166 and 12236); TTGATAA (14797, 14867); TTATGGG (15211, 15281); ACAGATG (27070, 27198); GTGGTAGA (9197, 9267); ACTTCTTT (26167, 26295); TGATTCTGA (12108, 12178); ACAATGTTG (14578, 14648); TACGAACTT (26108, 26236); GAATGTGGCTAA (12147, 12217) at s = 54.

The TAMGI deviations for the human and camel MERS-CoV in the range of the steps s from 1 to 550 are shown in Fig. 3. The top ranked grade comprises nearly 30 various steps (see Supplement S1).

(2018) established experimentally that a fragment on the genome of human MERS-CoV occupying sites 19712-19969 can be identified to function as a packaging signal dependent on N proteins. Such packaging signal is responsible for the transport of the RNA genome into the membrane envelope. This fragment corresponds to the windows #183 and #184. We detected within these windows the highest peak over complete profile for the motifs s = 42, whereas all other motifs were depleted in this region (seeFig. 5). For the next downstream window #185, we found very high local peak for the motifs with s = 171 especially pronounced for the longer motifs with k \u2265 5 (seeFig. 5B). Note also the high peaks for the profile s = 105 in the vicinity of the start region of the gene coding for N protein (window #265) and for the profiles s = 42 and 108 in the vicinity of the end region for this gene (window #274).All motifs with k \u2265 6 for s = 42, 54, 63, 105, 108, and 171 are collected in Supplement S3.

We chose for MHV the standard reference sequence for the strain MHV-A59 C12 mutant (accession: NC_001846.1); for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 we also used the reference sequences (NC_006213.1 and NC_006577.2). The therapeutic targeting of N protein for the pathogenic coronavirus HCoV-OC43 showed how the knowledge of molecular mechanisms of encapsidation can be used in medical applications. It was found that a compound known as PJ34 inhibits coronavirus replication and the RNA-binding activity of HCoV-OC43 N protein(Chang et al., 2016).Gui et al. (2017) found that parameters for the helical nucleocapsid of MHV were close to that of SARS-CoV (up to a slight uncertainty in the helix pitch). The structure of N protein for HCoV-OC43 was also close to that for SARS-CoV and MHV up to several divergent features(Chang et al., 2014;Peng et al., 2020). Taking into account the lengths of the genomes and of the genes coding for N proteins, a slight shift from p = 54 to p =57 may be expected in the main periods for RNAPS in the genomes of HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and MHV. Testing this hypothesis was among the matters of the study in this section.The related spectra for TAMGI deviations for s = 1-550 and JC deviations for s 1 = 54 and s 2 = 1-600 are shown inFig. 6(on the left and right, respectively).

The main characteristics for the genomes of these viruses were as follows.The highest deviation \u03ba 21 = 10.16 for the genome of HCoV-OC43 was a grade above the two nearest top ranked deviations, \u03ba 66 = 9.00 and \u03ba 3 = 8.67.

(1992) established that a region of about 190 nt within the gene coding for nsp15 functions as a packaging signal with the minimal core fragment of 61 nt occupying the sites 20356-20416. Based on the bulged stem-loop RNA secondary structure,Kuo & Masters (2016) suggested the region 20273-20367 for the packaging signal. We will use the region 20273-20416 as a reference because the experiments indicate that broader regions function more efficiently. This region corresponds to the windows #188 and #189. As is seen fromFig. 8Cand Supplement S2, there is a peak for the motifs s = 24 in the region with the packaging signal, whereas all other motifs were depleted in this region. The content of the longer motifs with k \u2265 5 for s = 24 attained the absolute maximum in the region of the packaging signal. A similar yet lower peak for s = 24 and less stringent depletion of the other motifs were observed for the windows #185 and #186 upstream from the packaging signal. We also found the abundance of motifs with s = 66 for the windows #184 and #185. The abundance of one motifs and depletion of the others was also inherent to the packaging signal for MERS-CoV (Section 3.2).The motifs with k \u2265 6 for s = 21, 24, 54, 57, 60, 63, and 66 for the genomes of all three coronaviruses are collected in Supplement S3. We found the following motifs with k \u2265 6 in the region20273-20416 for the MHV genome: none for s = 21, 54, 57, 60, 63; s = 24, GGGAGCCTT (20285); GGAGCC (20310); AAGGTAATC (20319); GGTAATC (20333); GGTGATC (20345); GCGGTAAT (20355); and s = 66, GGTGGTA (20330). Note the reproducibility of GGAGCC in the first two motifs and GGTAAT in the next four motifs for s = 24 and the approximately phased positioning of these motifs.A part of high peaks on the motif profiles is located in the region of the genes coding for the structural and accessory proteins. In particular, the high peaks for MHV, s = 24, 63 were located at the end region of the gene coding for S protein (windows #256 and 257), for s = 66 (windows #267 and 268, gene E), and s = 21 (window #270, gene M). The high peaks for the HCoV-HKU1 profiles were detected for s = 21, 54, and 57 within the region of the gene coding for M protein (windows #258 and 259), s = 63 within the region of the gene coding for E protein (windows #254 and 255), and s = 21, 54 within the region of the gene coding for S protein (window #216). The high peak for the HCoV-OC43 profiles was detected for s = 24 within the region of the gene coding for S protein (windows #241 and 242). Thus, the peaks on the profiles within the region of the gene coding for S protein can be considered as a common feature for all these lineage A coronaviruses. A possible relationship of this feature with the recombination is discussed in Section 4.3 below.",

The motifs for the other steps s were not, however, so depleted in this region as for MHV. The resolution of the alternative whether this region may function as packaging signal for HCoV-HKU1 or such similarity reflects the evolutionary conservation needs further experimental verification. For HCoV-OC43 the peak in the windows #189-190 was found for s = 54. The peak for s = 24 was downstream from this region in the windows #193-194 (sites 20737-21060 within the gene coding for 2'-O-methyltransferase). Except the genome for HCoV-HKU1 containing tandem repeats, the number of pairs with completely coincident TAMGI motifs within the same two other genomes was about 15-20 for each particular step s. The pair-wise comparison of coincident motifs in different genomes provides the number of pairs 20-50 for the counterpart s (Supplement S3). Both complete coincidences and coincidences up to one mismatch were mainly significantly higher between HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 than between HCoV-OC43 and MHV as well as between HCoV-HKU1 and MHV (Supplement S3).

The first three columns correspond to the normalized TAMGI deviations for s = 51, 54, and 57, respectively, whereas the extreme right column corresponds to the maximum deviation.The TAMGI deviations for the steps s = 51, 54 and 57 in the genomes of different coronaviruses are mutually compared inFig. 12. These data reveal the approximate bias to s = 51 and to s = 57 for the genomes shorter and longer than that of SARS-CoV. The deviations for s = 54 were the highest throughout related TAMGI spectra for the lineage B betacoronaviruses comprising the most virulent coronaviruses SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-Bat-CoV, whereas for the other lineages the relevant deviations associated with RNAPS can be a grade or two lower in comparison with the maximum one (seeFig. 12). Though N proteins are evolutionary conserved on the coding and structural levels, the mechanisms of evolving RNAPS are distinctly more variable for the different coronaviruses.The comparison of motif profiles for the different steps s with the experimentally verified packaging signals for MERS-CoV, MHV, and TGEV showed that commonly the motifs of one type are abundant within the region of the packaging signal, whereas the other motifs are depleted. The type of the putative indicator motifs and their peaked location in the genome vary strongly for the particular viruses.",

The nested sgmRNAs serve for the expression of the genes S-E-M-N, E-M-N, M-N, and N. The conclusion on the abundance of N proteins contradicts to the estimates obtained via stoichiometry (Neuman & Buchmeier, 2016).The specific N-RNA interactions are retained after freeing viral RNA from nucleocapsid. The biomolecular N-RNA condensates provide a plausible model for N-RNA complexes in cellular cytosol(Cascarina & Ross, 2020;Iserman et al., 2020;Lu et al., 2021;Perdikari et al., 2020;Savastano et al., 2020). A part of TAMGI motifs associated with the helical ribonucleocapsid periodicity p = 54 and with the other pronounced correlations should be responsible for the specific N-RNA interactions in such biomolecular condensates.The specific N-RNA interactions after freeing viral RNA from nucleocapsid proved also to affect the replication and transcription (see for a reviewChang et al., 2014;Masters, 2019; and references   therein). The level of gene expression should be concordant with the number of protein copies needed for self-assembly of the membrane envelope with the spike glycoproteins and the packaging of the genome.",
