Using high spatial resolution brain imaging, we tested whether a map of external space is transformed from purely visual (3D-based) information to a map of the whole body ('person'), in parietal cortex. This transformation was mediated by two sets of columns: one set encoded interpersonal distance and the other encoded visual distance, binocularly. These two sets of columns are mutually segregated in parietal cortex. These results suggest that the cortical transformation of sensory-to-social encoding of space near the body involves multiple local processes within parietal cortex.",

This hypothesis was tested using 7T fMRI at high spatial resolution. In response to different visual stimuli across a range of virtual distances, we found two categories of distance encoding in two corresponding columns within parietal cortex. One set of columns (\"P columns\") responded selectively to moving and stationary face images presented at virtual distances that were nearer (but not further) than each subjects' behaviorally-defined PS boundary. In the majority of P columns, BOLD response amplitudes increased monotonically and nonlinearly with increasing virtual face proximity. In a complementary subset of P columns, BOLD responses decreased with increasing proximity. A second set of parietal columns (\"D colummns\") responded selectively to disparity-based 'near' or 'far' distances, in random dot stimuli, similar to disparityselective columns described previously in occipital cortex. Importantly, in parietal cortex, maps of P columns were systematically non-overlapping (interdigitated) with D columns. These results suggest that the transformation of spatial information, from visual-to body-(or person-) centered, may be computed in multiple small sites, rather than across a larger cortical gradient, in parietal cortex.",

However, well before the introduction of this deliberate social distancing, many behavioral studies described the fundamental discomfort that people experience when an unfamiliar person becomes 'too close', intruding into their personal space (PS) (Hayduk, 1978 , Hayduk, 1983 . This interpersonal distancing between conspecifics may be related to the survival-based distancing that occurs between prey and predator species (Hediger, 1955 , Ardrey, 1966 .",

Repeated measurements of PS boundary distance are highy reliable within a given individual, but vary significantly between individuals (Hayduk, 1983 , Bar-Haim et al., 2002 , Cl\u00e9ry and Hamed, 2018 , Welsch et al., 2021 . Within the inner (PS) zone, discomfort increases gradually with closer interpersonal proximity (Hayduk, 1981a . Beyond the PS, discomfort is typically not elicited by the presence or absence of another person (but see ). Analogously, skin conductance (a measure of 'arousal') increases when experimental confederates are positioned closer to a subject, within (but not beyond) the PS , Candini et al., 2021 . The concept of personal space (emphasizing the discomfort and/or threat response evoked by interpersonal intrusion) is closely related to the concepts of peripersonal space (PPS, emphasizing the body limits) (Bogdanova et al., 2021) , body ownership (BO), body schema, and other distinctions.",

Such hypothetical alternative organizations imply correspondingly differing computational schemes. Our results generally support the second hypothesis. Specifically, the current results demonstrated multiple, local transformations of spatial information in parietal cortex, mediated via two sets of cortical columns, which differ in the nature of their spatial-(and threat-) encoding properties, ranging from visual to more egocentric scales. To our knowledge, no type of cortical column has been reported previously in parietal cortex.",

During this procedure, subjects were asked to stand still, facing the intruder, who initially stood 3 m away from the subject. Subjects were instructed as follows: \"Please stand still as my colleague walks slowly towards you. Say 'okay' when they reach a distance that you would normally stand to talk to someone who you have just met, when you start to feel slightly uncomfortable. When you say 'okay', they will pause. Please make sure to maintain eye contact with my colleague throughout the procedure\".

Two random dot stimuli (each either red or green) were overlaid on the display screen, and binocularly fused during BOLD acquisitions. In the main condition, stimuli formed a stereoscopic percept of a regular array of cuboids that varied sinusoidally in depth, i.e. within a 0.2-0.4 degrees of horizontal binocular disparity, stereoscopically 'near' or 'far', relative to the fixation plane, with independent phase, similar to stimuli described earlier (Tsao et al., 2003 , Nasr et al., 2016 . In the control condition, the fused percept spanned a fronto-parallel plane intersecting the fixation target (i.e., zero depth at the point of ocular convergence). Each block-designed experimental run included eight stimulus blocks (24 s/block), beginning and ending with an additional 12 s/ of uniform gray (\"blank\"). When stereoscopically fused, this random dot stimulus produced a percept of multiple 3D cuboids, each of which moved continuously towards then away (and vice versa) from the subject.

Consistent with the initial observations, we found that the maps showed significantly more overlap across sessions within a given subject when the maps of the two sessions were topographically aligned, compared to the non-aligned (systematically shuffled) maps (t-test: p<0.0001) ( Figure 4G-H) .

Thus, the different response profile of the approach-and withdrawal-biased columns could reflect correspondingly different strengths of the local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strengths from visual cortex to each column type in parietal cortex, without requiring additional input from the amygdala.

Thus it might be argued that the approach-and withdrawal-selective columns described above might involve disparity-selective neurons and columns, like those described previously in occipital visual cortex in macaques (Felleman and Van Essen, 1987 , Poggio et al., 1988 , Roy and Narahashi, 1992 , Deangelis et al., 1998 , Deangelis and Newsome, 1999 , Adams and Zeki, 2001 , Tanabe et al., 2005 , Chen et al., 2008 and in humans (Goncalves et al., 2015 , Nasr et al., 2016 , Tootell and Nasr, 2017 . However, this argument presumes that 'near' and 'far' disparityselective columns extend beyond occipital cortex, anteriorly into parietal cortex -and no such hypothetical disparity columns have been reported previously in parietal cortex. Accordingly, we next tested for the presence of disparity columns in the posterior parietal ROI, using random dot stereogram stimuli that selectively activated 'near' and 'far' distance disparity-selective columns in past studies of occipital cortex (Tsao et al., 2003 , Nasr et al., 2016 , Nasr and Tootell, 2018 , Nasr and Tootell, 2020 . When disparities in the two monocular images were binocularly fused, this random dot stimulus produced a stereoscopic percept of multiple 3D cuboids, moving continuously through near or far visual depths (see Methods). All subjects confirmed this stereoscopic percept during the scan session. All fMRI maps showed disparity-based near-and far-selective patches bilaterally in the inferior parietal cortex ( Figure 3C and D) .",

For simplicity, we refer to these disparity-sensitive parietal columns as 'D' (disparity) columns. In our parietal ROI, the near-selective disparity columns were slightly more numerous than the far-selective disparity columns, across the testable range of thresholds (above all thresholds between 10 -2 through 10 -5 ; t-test: all p-values < 0.01). This bias for near-(relative to far-) selective columns in parietal cortex may be related to a near-versus far-disparity bias reported in neighboring occipital cortex (Nasr and Tootell, 2020) .",

By comparison, sensitivity to personal space varies from a near limit at the observer's skin, to a far limit of ~ 50-100 cm (reviewed in (Hayduk, 1983) ). The midpoint (zero crossing) distance values between the near-and-far extremes also differ. In the case of personal space, those zero-crossing values are unrelated to where the subject is looking.

Panels D and E show the correlation values when sampled across a comparable distance in the perpendicular cortical plane, i.e. parallel with the cortical surfaces and layers. The sampling plane was deep (depth = 0.9) in panel D, and more superficial (depth = 0.1) in panel E. Thus, the functional response variations were more highly correlated in the radial axis, compared to the surface-parallel axis. Panel C shows one possible scheme to compute such parietal responses (bottom) from visual cortical inputs (top). Results from Experiments 1 and 2 suggested that the input corresponding to physically closer faces was larger in size, hence stronger. The average firing rates of the excitatory and inhibitory populations in inferior parietal cortex were represented by rate equations (Wilson and Cowan, 1972) , in which each population received weighted inputs from the other population and itself, through a sigmoid nonlinearity (Table 1) . For simplicity, this model assumed that BOLD levels represent the excitatory postsynaptic response, although it is known that BOLD signals reflect a combination of both pre-and postsynaptic activity (Logothetis et al., 2001 , Logothetis, 2003 . The synaptic weights between and within the two populations were considered free parameters, which were tuned to approximate the response profiles of approach-and withdrawal-selective columns (Table 1 ).",

Table 1 . Parameters of the computational model. Numerical values of the parameters in the current scheme. Following the widely used framework of the firing rate neural models (Wilson and Cowan 1972) , the firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory populations were modeled as: ! = \u2212 ! + !! ( ! ) + !\" ( \" ) + ! + ! \" = \u2212 \" + \"! ( ! ) + \"\" ( \" ) + \" + \" where ! and \" are the firing rate of excitatory and inhibitory populations, respectively. !! is the synaptic strength of excitatory-to-excitatory connections, !\" is the strength of inhibitory-to-excitatory connections, \"! is the strength of excitatory-to-inhibitory connections, and \"\" is the strength of inhibitory-to-inhibitory connections. Each population has a baseline activity represented by ! and \" , respectively. Finally, each population receives the external input weighted by synaptic strengths ! and \" , respectively. Each population receives the firing rate of the other population as input through a sigmoid nonlinear function ( ) = 1/(1 + exp (\u2212( + ))), where represents the intrinsic soft threshold of the population activity. The variable of interest in our simulations was the stable steady-state firing rate of excitatory population as a function of the strength of the external input . ",
