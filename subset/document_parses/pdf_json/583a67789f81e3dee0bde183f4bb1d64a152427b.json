The linear host-guest relation suggested synthesis of a 1:1 complex of AND with 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD by inclusion mode. The Kc, stability constant of the two phase system of AND with 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD computed to be 38.60 x 10 \u00c03 M. 1 H NMR spectrum of AND indicated the presence of triplet at 6.63-ppm which was up-fielded in AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex at 6.60-ppm (doublet) confirmed the insertion of AND in cavity of 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD through lactone ring. AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex exhibited the IC 50 of 0.1-\u03bcg.mL \u00c01 (E gene) and 0.29-\u03bcg.mL \u00c01 (N gene) against SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero6 cells. Moreover, a 1.5-fold increment in extent of absorption of AND was noticed post complexation. The bioavailability was estimated to be 15.87 AE 3.84% and 23.84 AE 5.46%, respectively for AND and AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex. AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex may be a prospective candidate for further studies to evolve as a clinically viable formulation against SARS-CoV-2.",

AND exhibited rapid plasma clearance with halflives (t 1/2 ) of 1.86 AE 0.21 h and 3.30 AE 0.35 h following i.v. (intravenous) and oral administration, respectively [7] . The poor oral bioavailability of AND may be credited to physicochemical as well as biopharmaceutical factors such as low water solubility (3.29 AE 0.73 \u03bcg.mL \u00c01 ) [8] and high hydrophobicity due to log P of 2.632 AE 0.135 [9] . In addition, rapid biotransformation and efflux by P-gp (Pumping glycoprotein) also reduce the oral bioavailability of AND [8] . About 55% of the AND binds with human plasma proteins [10] . 2-Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD is an analogue of cyclodextrin (CYD), a macrocycle composed of seven \u03b1-D-glucopyranoside units. The US-FDA (Food and Drug Administration) listed 2-HyP\u03b2-CYD (Aqueous solubility>500 mg.mL \u00c01 at room temperature) as approved inert material for oral and intravenous administration [11] . Moreover, 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD has been widely employed for improving biopharmaceutical chattels of a number of pharmaceutical products including antihypertensive drug [12] , antimicrobial drugs [13, 14] , and antiviral drugs through both oral and inhalation route of administration [15, 16] . Therefore, in the present investigation, AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex was formulated both in solid and solution state and characterized under a set of rigorous in vitro as well as in vivo parameters to exhibit its therapeutic prospective against SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

The 2D structure of AND was transformed into the 3D structure in LigPrep module, and the energy was lessened using OPLS3 [21] . The AND (ionization state) was created at pH 7.0 AE 2.0 with the help of Epik module of LigPrep while rest of the parameters were set to default values.

The assessment and refinement of protein structure were done using protein preparation wizard (GLIDE) [20, 22] .

A molecular inclusion approach was utilized to modify and solubilize AND in the current study via the solvent evaporation technique [19] . Post synthesis of the AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex, next step was to find out the arrangement, ratio, and the Kc of the complex. Hence, phase solubility assay method was adopted to measure the stoichiometry of the complex in solution phase [27] . The phase-solubility curve of AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex in solution is illustrated in Figure 1 . The AND solubility was increased linearly as a function of 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD concentration. This information allowed to recognize the phase-solubility curve as A L type in AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex [27] . The lineal host-guest correlativity with slope (<1) advised synthesis of a 1:1 ratio complex of AND with 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD. The kc of AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex in solution phase was calculated to be 38.60 x 10 \u00c03 M.",

ATR spectra were captured to examine the modification of frequencies that happened due to hydrophobic interactions during the inclusion of AND in 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD cavity. The chart of ATR stretching frequencies of AND, 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD, physical mixture and AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex are stated in Table 1 . The AND spectrum demonstrated a typical peak at 1,723 cm \u00c01 (\u03bd, C\u00bcO), pointed out the existence of a lactone ring. Moreover, peaks of therapeutic entity were remarked at 1,633 cm \u00c01 and 1,074 cm \u00c01 that proposed presence of -C\u00bcC and -C-O bond, respectively. Other peaks detected for AND were 2,925 cm \u00c01 and 2,849 owing to the various OCH 3 and CH 3 groups. The 2-HyP\u03b2-CYD spectrum demonstrated the vibration of free -OH groups at 3,343 cm \u00c01 whereas 2,927 cm \u00c01 and 1,022 cm \u00c01 displayed the existence of -CH 3 stretching and C-O-C bending, respectively. The physical mixture of AND with 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD pointed out the existence of monovular peaks of individual components. Finally, spectrum of AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex suggested the synthesis due to the presence of intact lactone (1727 cm \u00c01 ) and -C\u00bcCbond (1673 cm \u00c01 ) of drug in addition to 2925 cm \u00c01 (-CH 2 /CH 3 ) and 3338 cm \u00c01 (-OH group) of 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD (Table 1) .",

The consequent \u0394\u03b4 (chemical shift), is depicted as change between bound and free therapeutic molecule chemical shifts. Such consequent chemical shifts were estimated by employing the equation \u0394\u03b4 \u00bc \u03b4 complex -\u03b4 free [28] . Ultimately, this formula yielded downfield-and upfield chemical shifts, respectively. The spectrum of AND, 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD and AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD is shown in Figure 2 . The H3 as well as H 5 protons (3.71 ppm) situated in the vicinity of 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD were shifted upfield (3.62 ppm) due to molecular interaction with AND, betraying the synthesis of solid complex by the inclusion mode. In addition, the shift in the signals for the protons H 1 and H 2 in addition to H 4 , and H 6 active on the surface of 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD informed about the host molecule's conformational alteration in the presence of therapeutic entity. 1 H NMR spectrum of AND indicated the presence of triplet at 6.63 ppm ( Figure 2 ) which was up-fielded in AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex at 6.60 ppm (doublet) confirmed the introduction of AND in cavity of 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD through lactone ring. This is in agreement with the ATR data. Moreover, intermolecular interactions in AND-2--HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex were confirmed by 2D ROESY spectroscopy [29] and presented in Figure 2 . 2D NMR spectroscopy is a vital technique for the characterization of solid complex in solution state. This illustrates the existence of cross-peaks between protons from both CYD and guest molecule. In addition, the comparative intensities of cross-peaks depend on the spacing between the related protons. ROESY also correlates the triplet at 6.63 ppm of AND with H-3 protons (3.71 ppm) of 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD ( Figure 2) .",

It was observed that AND was best docked to 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD with Glide energy of -29.807 kcal.mol \u00c01 , potential energy of -3535.08 kcal.mol \u00c01 , Van der Waals energy of -6797.27 kcal.mol \u00c01 and electrostatic energy of -4060.78 kcal.mol \u00c01 (Figure 3 and Table 2 ).

In addition, AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex in solid state was also characterized using DSC to notice the endothermic peak and comparison was made with respective components as presented in Figure 4 . Thermogram demonstrated that the endothermic peak of AND was noticed at 214.81 C close to the melting point range (225-226 C). The thermograms of all cyclodextrins owing to dehydration process (CDs i.e. \u03b1-, \u03b2 and \u03b3-CDs) display a wide range of endothermic peaks ranging from 40 to 150 C (77.52 C for 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD).

Although this stands for reduction of crystalline structure, however; a few sharp peaks were also noticed signaling the impression of AND. Eventually, PXRD of AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD solid complex illustrated vague, broad diffused peaks of vitiated intensities with limited sharp peaks. This confirmed the significant transformation of AND crystalline architecture in to amorphous geometry in AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD solid complex. Next, SEM was exploited to figure out the microscopical aspects of therapeutic entity before and after complexation. Photomicrograph of AND informed the presence of crystalline stuff of asymmetrical size ( Figure 5 ). 2-HyP\u03b2-CYD also seemed as particles with no decisive structure. Furthermore, physical mixture highlighted the crystalline geometry of both AND and 2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD instead of AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex which displayed small size particles aiding to aggregation, recommended the creation of an amorphous structure with the presence of a single component in the complex, and thus pointed out the absolute complexation.

Recently, US FDA, has placed more stress on dissolution chart of therapeutic moieties. A dissolution chart can help to qualify the product more accurately than a single point dissolution test under suitable test conditions. The F1, factor is relative to the mean difference between the two profiles, whereas F2 factor is reciprocally proportional to the mean squared difference between the two charts, with emphasis on the larger deviation among all the time points. The F2 factor depicts the closeness between the two charts. During the comparison of dissolution profile, when the two charts are similar, then F 2 is equal to 100. The F 2 value was measured to be 40 % indicating no similarity between dissolution profile of AND and AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD solid complex.",

AND exhibited C max of 239.6 AE 75.37 \u03bcg.mL \u00c01 with t max of 2 h at the dose of 100 mg.kg \u00c01 post oral administration in rats that was remarkably (Unpaired t test, P < 0.05) improved (461.105 AE 103.00 \u03bcg.mL \u00c01 ) in AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex. AND-2-HyP-\u03b2-CYD complex substantiated the improved absorption in terms of AUC last of 1842.115 AE 125.51 h.\u03bcg.mL \u00c01 as compared (Unpaired t test, P < 0.05) to 1223.6 AE 143.09 h.\u03bcg.mL \u00c01 of AND.",
