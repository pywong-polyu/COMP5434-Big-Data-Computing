This case report describes the duration of viable SARS-CoV-2 in two immunocompromised patients with completely different clinical courses and further addresses the immunological aspects. Case presentations: Oropharyngeal swaps were collected continuously during hospitalization for two immunocompromised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and sent for analysis to real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral culture assessed by plaque assay and full genome sequencing. Blood samples for flow cytometry and further immunological analysis were taken once during admission. One patient was without symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) whereas the other had severe respiratory symptoms requiring a stay at an intensive care unit (ICU) and treatment with remdesivir and dexamethasone. Despite their difference in clinical courses, they both continuously shed SARS-CoV-2 with high viral loads in culture. Both patients had undetectable anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels about 2 weeks after the first positive real time RT-PCR test of SARS-CoV-2, marked expansions of virus reactive CD8+ T cells but cellular markers indicative of attenuated humoral immunity. Conclusions: Our case illustrates the importance of distinguishing isolation guidelines for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 according to their immunological status. Furthermore, it demonstrates the need for immune markers relating to viral shedding in immunocompromised patients.",

A study including 21 hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed that the median time from symptom onset to viral clearance in culture was 7 days [2] . These findings underlie the isolation guidelines used by the World Health Organization (WHO) which state that SARS-CoV-2 infected persons can discontinue isolation 10 days after symptom onset plus at least 3 additional days without symptoms [3] . Regarding asymptomatic cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the duration of infectiousness is still uncertain. Asymptomatic patients appear to shed virus for longer periods than symptomatic patients, measured by real time RT-PCR, and this may reflect a weaker degree of immune activation [4] . Jiang et al. [5] reported shortened IgG sero-conversion times among asymptomatic compared to symptomatic patients, whereas Shirin et al. reported the opposite [6] . These deviating findings could be attributable to differences in study groups, methods of symptoms recollection, viral loads and sensitivity of immune assays or underlying immunity. Immune markers might be useful as determinants for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding. A limited number of case reports indicate protracted viral shedding in immunocompromised patients observed in both real time RT-PCR and in viral culture [7] [8] [9] but these studies provided no detailed description of cellular immune status.",

During admission mycophenolatmofetil was paused and tacrolimus was reduced in dose. Prednisolone dosage was increased to 55 mg daily shortly after admission. On day 12 from symptom onset, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for noninvasive ventilation. At the ICU he was treated with intravenous dexamethasone 6 mg daily and remdesivir 200 mg \u00d7 1 the first day and 100 mg \u00d7 1 the following 4 days.

Furthermore, not many studies have quantified viable virus. The significance of the amount of viable virus is still uncertain, but it must be assumed that higher viral load will mean greater infectivity. immunocompromised patients. The asymptomatic patient had viable virus 12 days after initial positive real time RT-PCR.

Allo-responsive T cells are dependent upon cognate TCR-MHC-peptide interactions as is the generation of cT FH [10] . Patient 1 received a T cell repressive regimen while patient 2 was lymphopenic and received lenalidomid which suppresses CD4+ T cell proliferation in-vitro [11] . Patient 2 also suffered from a disseminated Nocardia infection, indicating compromised CD4+ T cell immunity. Hence, both patients reduced allo-reactive CD4+ T cell fractions were consistent with their impaired cT FH formation versus that of an immunocompetent COVID-19 patient (day 20: 7.14%) [12] . CT FH are strong indicators for the generation of antibodies to protein antigens [10] . Expansion of viral sensitive CD8+ CD38+ HLA-DR+ T cells [12] was observed in both patients, consistent with their preserved fractions of allo-reactive CD8+ T cells [Additional file 2 Table 1 ].

Compromised humoral immunity also characterizes myeloma patients. The strength of this case report is the inclusion of analyzes and description of cellular immune markers in both the asymptomatic and the symptomatic immunocompromised patient infected with SARS-CoV_2. Furthermore, the quantification of viable virus with plaque assay gives a more accurate picture of the duration of infectiveness. As a limitation, whole genome sequencing was only performed once during admission for both patients, and therefore potential mutations during hospitalization were not characterized.",
