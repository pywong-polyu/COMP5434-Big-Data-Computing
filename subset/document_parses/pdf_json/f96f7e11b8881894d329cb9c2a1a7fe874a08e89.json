For Dutch audiological speech tests in quiet, ASR apps performed similarly to a person with a moderate hearing loss.

Adding new performance metrics including the semantic difference as a function of SNR and reverberation time could help to monitor and further improve ASR performance.",

The software converts speech into text using artificial intelligence models that have been trained on vast collections of speech containing millions of words. ASR software is widely available on most digital devices, including smartphones, tablets, or laptops. It is primarily used for voice commands (e.g., hey Siri!), at the workplace to create transcripts, or in class for taking notes. Recently, ASR has become available in online meetings (e.g., Microsoft teams) and video recordings (e.g., Google's Youtube) to provide automated captions. Also, several ASRbased speech-to-text apps have been developed for the hearing impaired and deaf, providing live captioning of conversations (2, 3) , showing the potential of automation and artificial intelligence for hearing healthcare (4, 5) . Early in 2020, we were confronted in our clinic with questions from patients related to the use of ASR apps for daily communication. These questions were especially common among patients with severe to profound hearing loss who visited our outpatient clinic to assess if they were eligible for a Cochlear Implant. Also, patients who had experienced sudden deafness, but had not yet been fitted with hearing aids, made use of an ASR app during their appointments. There was no or little experimental information at the time about the performance and usability of the ASR apps for hearing impaired persons beyond what was shared by developers. Nor did we have clear criteria for which groups of patients we might suggest the ASR apps to.",

            "text": "Since 2017, several ASR systems have claimed speech recognition performance close to that of normally hearing humans (1, 2) . The most common metric to express ASR performance, used to underpin these claims, is the word error rate (WER). WER is calculated by adding the number of missing, wrong, and inserted words and dividing this by the total number of words (6) . A lower WER score means better performance. The performance of ASR will be best for speech similar to the speech on which it was trained (7) . It is therefore important to understand for what specific task an ASR is designed and how it is evaluated. Typically ASRs are evaluated on well-studied large (>100 h) collections of speech, referred to as a corpus. The SwitchBoard corpus and CallHome corpus are well-known collections of conversational phone calls (8), whereas Librispeech is a corpus comprising speech from public domain audiobooks. The SwitchBoard corpus consists of conversations over the phone between strangers about a given topic (9) . The CallHome corpus consists of more informal conversations between friends and family (8). None of these corpora are ideal for use in acoustically challenging environments. The SwitchBoard and CallHome were collected under low noise and low reverberation conditions (9) , and a large portion of the Librispeech corpus has undergone noise removal and volume normalization (10) .",

Speaker identification cues [e.g., by color coding each speaker a feature in AVA (14) ] may also direct the reader to the face of an active talker. Other design ideas include the notification of critical environmental sounds [a feature incorporated in Live Transcribe (15) ], feedback to the speaker of their intelligibility of the ASR, or feedback to the speaker by making the transcript readable from two sides (e.g., mirrored) so that both the speaker and the listener can check the results [incorporated in Earfy (16) ].",

For example, the settings where people with hearing loss use ASR may be more often in a more homely atmosphere between family members that might use more colloquial language or slang. That situation may be similar to closed caption for video series. The most common complaint of people with hearing loss is the reduced speech perception in complex listening environments including cocktail parties, restaurants, in conversations with their doctor, and family gatherings (15, 16) . Adverse acoustic conditions, including low signal-to-noise, make it difficult for normal hearing listeners to understand speech and make the speech incomprehensible for persons with mild to profound hearing loss (17, 18) . Finally, the speed of translation to accommodate a fluent conversation and the user interface to make it practical for older users and digitally less proficient users are factors to consider.",

The four apps tested were Ava and Earfy that both run on iOS and Android, Speechy iOS only, and Live Transcribe Android only.

The smartphones were placed one meter in front of a speaker in a sound treated room compliant with ISO 8253-1 (19) . Standard clinical calibration protocols were used for all speech material. The microphone of the smartphone was aimed toward the speaker, which we assumed to be the optimal microphone orientation, at approximately the height of a listener's ears to resemble testing conditions when tested with human listeners (see Figure 1 ). The smartphone screen was facing upwards allowing the experimenter to read the text from the screen. Four different speech reception tests were performed to evaluate the app's ability to convert speech into text. First, the apps were tested on speech recognition in quiet by converting a list of single words into text. The standard Dutch speech recognition test for this purpose is the Dutch CNC-test, which consists of phonetically balanced lists of twelve monosyllabic Dutch words in quiet [CNC-list, \"Nederlandse Vereniging voor Audiologie;\" (20) ]. The words were played through a speaker, scored and displayed in a phoneme recognition score. All words consisted of three phonemes with a consonant-nucleus-consonant (CNC) structure. The first word was a test word and was not included in the scoring. A human observer performed the scoring by reading the word from the screen and counting the number of correct phonemes. Inserted phonemes were subtracted from the score according to the clinical scoring procedure (20) . If a displayed word changed during the test, the final word was scored. A 100% phoneme recognition score was reached if all 33 phonemes of the 11 words were correct. Several lists were presented at an intensity level of 45, 55, 65, 75, and 85 dB sound pressure level (SPL) and the speech recognition as a function of presentation level (known in human listeners as speech audiogram) is plotted for each app. For comparison, normal hearing listeners achieve 100% phoneme recognition at 45 dB SPL (20) .",

In comparison, Dingemanse and Goedegebure (26) found a mean score of 82% in 50 adult unilateral CI-recipients on the Dutch CNC-test tested in free field at 65 dB SPL, which is the level of conversational speech. This performance may be an overestimation for the average CI user since they excluded participants with a CNC-score below 60%. Kaandorp et al. (27) determined a mean score in free field at 65 dB SPL of 95% while using their preferred device in 24 hearing aid users with a moderate to severe hearing loss and 80% in 24 CI recipients. Only for speech at high-intensity levels, well above the level of conversational speech, do the apps achieve 90 to 100% speech reception. The poor performance at low speech intensity levels may be caused by hardware limitations, as discussed below in the section on hardware. The ASR may score lower due to the lack of contextual information provided in the test. The CNCtest was developed as an auditory test that requires little linguistic skill. The listener can only use the consonant-nucleus-consonant structure and the fact that the lists contain only familiar existing words. The alternative of using nonsense words, or nonsense sentences, would probably further deteriorate ASR performance while being a valid test for assessing auditory function with a lower effect of language skills by the subject (28) . Most ASR are trained on sentences of realistic conversations (8). The strength of (deep learning) ASR is based on using contextual information from a natural language processing model (29) .

The ASR is at a disadvantage because in the DIN-test, contextual information is lacking and the priors for the ASR and human are not the same. When doing a digitsin-noise test, a human will only report digits. For the ASR it is not a 10-class problem but a problem with several thousand alternatives.

In another study, Kaandorp et al. (30) found a significant difference of 1.0 dB in favor of a keyword scoring procedure compared to scoring full sentences. However, this 1.0 dB keyword effect does not account for the large difference between the app's performance and the performance of hearing aid users in noise.

Possibly with more natural sentences to provide even more linguistic cues. Testing through a loudspeaker has the advantage that it takes the effect of room acoustics into account, making the test condition more realistic. Instead of a sound booth, a room with more representative acoustics for daily situations (e.g., the reverberation time of a classroom or using babble noise instead of speech-shaped noise) would provide even more representative results. The current scoring procedure of the Plomp-test, based on fully correct sentences, leads to very high SNRs that may underestimate the practical value of ASR for hearing impaired persons. For instance, if an ASR in a conversation under noisy conditions provides keywords, it may already benefit the person with hearing impairment. One could easily adopt the Plomp-test by determining the WER score on a fixed SNR level to simulate above example. Or alternatively, accept a higher number of mistakes (compared to none) in the adaptive test by using keywords (30) . Besides audiological test outcomes, the systematically collected feedback by groups of users (e.g., a focus group) would be very helpful to further improve the accessibility and usability of ASR apps for hearing impaired listeners.",

In actual use, the microphone orientation could be suboptimal, for instance, if a listener positions the device such that it enables better reading of the transcript from the screen. Also in group settings, the user will likely put the device flat on a table and thus not always point the microphone to the talker. We did not investigate the effect of suboptimal microphone orientation. Another explanation for the level dependence in quiet could be pre-processing.

Fortunately, generic ASR models can be used as a pre-trained model that subsequently is trained on a particular task including a-typical speech, accents, or acoustic conditions without incurring the cost of training a full model (44) . Recently, researchers from Google started a project, called Parrotron, to create personalized models which could better convert deaf speech than generic ASR systems. WER dropped from 89.2% for the generic ASR to 32.7% for the finetuned ASR for a single prelingually deaf subject (35) .

In addition, ASR technology, when further developed, can play a role in computational approaches to audiology (4) . For instance, if personalized ASR apps further develop so that atypical speech is better captured, and if ASR achieves normal hearing performance on audiology tests it may provide another use case: patients could perform self-testing (i.e., automated speech audiometry) by repeating the speech they hear to an ASR system trained on their particular voice replacing or enhancing the task of the professional in the audiology center (48) . Manual calculation of complex evaluation metrics is not suitable in clinical settings given the excessive time required and may lead to inter-rater variability (49) . Automated speech audiometry using algorithms to score performance can be a valuable complement to automated pure-tone threshold audiometry (50) . For example, Venail et al. (48) validated a semi-automatic speech procedure using customized word-lists, in part provided by the subject to include familiar words. The customized word-lists were recorded with the subject's own voice to incorporate personalized acoustic and articulatory parameters. Speech recognition was evaluated on the customized wordlist using an algorithm to determine automatically the number of correctly repeated phonemes. In addition, the use of ASR could open venues to improved (automated) scoring methods in audiology tests. Ratnanather et al. (51) demonstrated how one can automate the alignment of phonemes based on the minimum edit distance between the source speech and the utterances of the subject in real time. Visualizing this alignment may provide insights to clinicians about what phonological errors are made.",

Although scoring keywords makes the test accessible to a larger population, it reduces the discriminative power between higher-and lower-educated native listeners (30) . An ASR could facilitate an automated scoring procedure that differentiates between errors. For instance, using semantic difference between the ASR transcript and ground truth, errors that lead to semantically similar sentences are weighted favorably, leading to a better outcome metric in terms of how well hearing impaired persons can participate in a conversation under adverse circumstances.",

On audiological speech tests in quiet, ASR apps performed similarly to listeners with a moderate hearing loss. When transcribing speech-in-noise, the ASR apps performed in the performance range of CI recipients. Sentencesin-noise provided a quick test to assess ASR performance. Additional performance measures are needed to evaluate ASR apps. Besides the speech material, also type of noise and the presentation mode audio-only vs. audiovisual need to be considered. Adding new performance metrics including the semantic difference as a function of SNR and reverberation time can help to monitor and further improve ASR performance. Clinicians can use benchmarks based on such metrics to counsel prospective users and may benefit from automated procedures. Several hearing impaired listeners, especially CI recipients, report that they benefit from the apps in certain situations (47) , which is in accordance with the results of converting a dialogue into text and may stem from complementary error patterns of ASR not investigated here. Personalized ASR could increase the number of listeners enjoying the benefits of ASR.",
