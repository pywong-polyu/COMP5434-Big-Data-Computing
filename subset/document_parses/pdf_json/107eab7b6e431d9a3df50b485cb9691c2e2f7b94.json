Nicotine is considered one of the causal factors in the adverse effects of tobacco on sleep quality due to its effects as a stimulant resulting in decreased sleep time and increased nighttime awakenings. Over ninety percent of e-cigarettes contain nicotine, and thus it is likely that vaping will also impact sleep quality due to the nicotine content [1, 2] . In our previous study, we found that female users of both conventional tobacco and e-cigarettes, known as dual users, had worsened sleep quality and higher sleep latency (amount of time to fall asleep) than never smokers/never vapers [3] . This pilot study was replicated in a larger cohort, validating our findings that dual use is associated with increased sleep latency (manuscript in revision).",

Others only looked at one type of inhalant rather than all four groups. Of the eleven articles reviewed, one only alluded to a possible relationship between e-cigarette use, oxidative stress, and adverse effects on sleep [4] . Only one study did not find a difference in sleep duration or quality in e-cigarette users; however, this study design had concerning limitations using unvalidated methods for assessing sleep [5] . The remaining nine articles had findings supportive of a relationship between e-cigarette use and decreased sleep quality including sleep duration, onset, latency or regularity [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In summary, although the articles all had unique limitations from study design to generalizability of findings, the vast majority of the articles concluded that e-cigarette or dual use leads to alterations in sleep that need further investigation.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many lifestyle changes were required for the global population. These included changes to work environment, childcare, social interactions, physical activity, etc. These alterations to normal routine inevitably bring about new feelings that are sometimes positive but often negative, stressful, and anxiety-provoking. Further, the pandemic itself led to fear of dying, fear of spreading the virus, and fear of losing loved ones as another layer of stress. According to epidemiologic data provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) [15, 16] , between the two timepoints of the surveys the globe was experiencing a trend of increasing daily COVID cases. In the same timeframe, the US was experiencing a spike in daily deaths and a plateau in daily cases of COVID-19. Because sleep is negatively impacted during times of increased stress [17, 18] , we hypothesized that the negative correlations between historical or active use of nicotine-based inhalants may be amplified as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed.",

Specifically, types of inhalants and amount of vaping and smoking per day were both quantified. The years of tobacco use were included in the historical smoker questions. Participants were recruited through online advertisements posted to social media sites including Facebook, Craigslist, Reddit, and Twitter. All participants underwent informed consent prior to taking the survey. Participants (n = 554) were recruited in April 2020, and a subset (n = 217) retook the survey in June 2020. In the June retake survey, six questions were added to assess the subjects' current level of COVID concern. Specifically, these questions included: \"How concerned about COVID are you right now? How much has COVID disrupted your life? Has the COVID-19 pandemic caused you anxiety? Since the pandemic began, how has your work-related stress changed? Have you contracted COVID? Have any family members, friends, or loved ones contracted COVID?\" All participants were entered into a weekly lottery for a USD 250 Amazon gift card.",

Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings as well as studying broader populations. Our cohort had significant age differences between the e-cigarette group and the other inhalant groups; however, multivariate analysis was able to define the impact of age as well as inhalant use on PSQI scores. As this survey-based study relied on participants' self-reporting, there may have been inaccuracy in responses. However, we anticipate such misclassification to be random and thus should bias towards the null hypothesis. A baseline, pre-pandemic PSQI score was not collected. Nonetheless, this study having multiple time points of data collection during the pandemic opens the door for eventual comparison to post-pandemic PSQI scores. Another limitation of this study is that it is only able to infer correlation between inhalant use and sleep quality, not causation. As such, we are only able to discuss the associations between inhalant use and sleep quality as the pandemic progressed, not impact or effects. The study assessed the relationship between the COVID pandemic and the participants lifestyle with a series of six questions that were added to the retake survey. Ideally, the study would have included more questions to evaluate the degree of limitations and emotional responses to the stressor of the global pandemic in more depth. However, in the interest of being able to recruit and retain participants, the number of questions within our survey were minimized. In addition, because of the multiple locations of study participants throughout the US and worldwide, it was not possible to define characteristics of the pandemic, including severity and evolution, at each location.

            "text": "In this study, we found differences in sleep quality associated with history of inhalant use. As global events including the COVID-19 pandemic continue to occur, it is important for the general public to be informed about the possible adverse associations that nicotinebased inhalants could be having on sleep quality. As poor sleep quality is known to be detrimental to general health and wellbeing, we view measures to improve sleep and immune function as important strategies for disease prevention. Informed Consent Statement: Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study.",
