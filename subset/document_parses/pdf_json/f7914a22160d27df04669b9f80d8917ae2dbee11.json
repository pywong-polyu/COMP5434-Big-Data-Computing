            "text": "Online experimental methods are used in psychological studies investigating the perceptions and impressions of facial photographs, even without substantial evidence supporting their reliability and validity. Although, the quality of visual stimuli is more difficult to control remotely, the methods might allow us to obtain a large amount of data. Then the statistical analysis of a larger volume of data may reduce errors and suggest significant difference in the stimuli. Therefore, we analyzed the reliability and validity of online surveys in investigating the perceptions (shine, red, and dark) and impressions (attractiveness, trustworthy, and so on) of facial photographs created from averaged faces with skin tones modified using computer graphics (CG). In this study, we conducted online (Online1) and laboratory experiments with well-controlled conditions (Control). For each experiment, 50 participants (men and women in Japan, age: 20-59 years) completed the same questionnaire regarding their impressions of the same 28 CG facial photographs. The results showed significant correlations between the two experiments for all 19 items in the questionnaire. SD in the Online1 compared to the Control from the stimuli and individual differences were 56-84 and 88-104% in each questionnaire items, respectively. Moreover, the rates of mismatching perceptual evaluations to the corresponding physical features demonstrated in the photographs were 4.9-9.7% on average in an additional online survey of another 2,000 participants (Online2). These results suggest that online surveys can be applied to experiments to investigate impressions from CG facial photographs instead of general laboratory experiment by obtaining an appropriate number of participants to offset larger statistical errors that may result from the increased noise in the data from conducting the experiment online.",

In studies conducted in a laboratory, facial photographs are presented as printed media or on computer displays with controlled color and brightness and under well-controlled lighting conditions.

This is especially important advantage of online surveys during the current coronavirus pandemic as of course online surveys cut the risk of transmission of infectious disease. In online settings, the cost of recruiting participants and providing a suitable research location can be used to acquire a larger number of participants instead. Although, there is a potential disadvantage in this approach due to the increase the error in the evaluation of each stimulus (due to less control over visual stimuli among participants and the subsequent increase in individual differences.), the larger data sample may be an advantage in detecting evaluation differences within the stimuli because the SE is inversely proportional to the square of the sample size.",

For example, Crump et al. (2013) found that a variety of commonly used tasks performed online produced results broadly consistent with laboratory results. However, the validity and reliability of online surveys for investigating impressions from facial photographs remains unknown. This is important because, unlike linguistic stimuli, the subjective impression of a face photograph may change depending on conditions under which the photograph is viewed. For example, the radiance of a face can affect the impression of it (Ikeda et al., 2021) . The radiance of the face can be affected by the room conditions and display screen conditions, neither of which can be controlled easily in an online experiment.",

Specifically, the current study aimed to investigate the validity and reliability of an online survey of perception of and impressions formed by faces. We also attempted to calculate the necessary number of participants for an online survey if the same level of statistic reliability was required. In both experiments, 50 participants evaluated the same 28 computer graphics (CG) stimuli faces that varied by age, sex, and skin features. The faces were evaluated in 19 items of the questionnaire, which assessed the perceptual features and impressions using a five-point Likert scale. Then, the validity and reliability of the online surveys was evaluated by examining the correlations between the values evaluated in the two experiments. If the correlations of the data in online survey to a typical experiment in a laboratory with well-controlled stimuli are statistically significant, the online method could be regarded as valid because it suggests that online survey can provide the same data of evaluations.",

From eight facial photographs, four original averaged faces were created: Japanese men in their 20s, Japanese men in their 40s, Japanese women in their 20s, and Japanese women in their 40s. The darker and brighter faces were created from the original averaged face by making the skin tone darker or brighter by +2 or \u22122 SDs from L* on the cheek, based on the distribution of skin color from a previous experiment by the authors (unpublished). The red and yellow images were also created by adjusting the color of the original face to +2 SD or \u22122 SDs based on the a* and b* distributions for red and yellow, respectively, from the same study. The shiny and matte images were created by a professional CG creator who altered the contrast of the skin color.

We found positive correlations between Online1 and control experimental data for all the questionnaire items, suggesting that online survey is valid, but that the number of participants needed is 1.3-2.6 times that of a laboratory survey. In addition, there were generally low rates of mismatch. The positive correlations suggest that the online survey and the general laboratory survey produced comparable results. The values of R 2 between the Online1 and Control suggested moderate or low correlations for the items regarding impression (0.240-0.742) compared to items regarding perceptions (0.911-0.951). Nonetheless, because values of R 2 are dependent on SDs in the differences of the stimuli, which, even in the general survey, were smaller for the items of impressions based on the perceptions in the information processing than the evaluation of the perceptions themselves. These results support the validity of online surveys.",

The required online sample size was estimated to be 1.3-2.6 times larger compared to the control based on the difference of errors within the two methods from the differences of stimuli and individual differences; these values may vary based on additional data and may depend on specific methods. Namely, differences in the stimuli were difficult to observe because of difficulty controlling the quality of visual stimuli in an online survey; however, this can be partially overcome by increasing the sample size.",

Online surveys using visual stimuli can also be limited by the characteristics of devices used by participants; device type should thus be considered carefully, especially in experiments using a between-subject design. Although, the types of devices used were limited to personal and tablet computers in the current surveys, the differences between groups in the scores might also be influenced by the bias of the device types used within specific consumer segments.",

The benefits may outweigh the potential limitations especially during the current pandemic. The current study adds to the growing list of reports in behavioral science (Chesney et al., 2009; Crump et al., 2013; Hergueux and Jacquemet, 2015) and psychophysics (Semmelmann and Weigelt, 2017) that support the use of online experimental methods.
