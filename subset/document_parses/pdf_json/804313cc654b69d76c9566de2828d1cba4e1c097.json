Although the majority of research studies demonstrating the effectiveness of activity schedules have used schedule books composed of static printed pictures attached to physical pages, recently researchers have begun to demonstrate the effectiveness of technology-based activity schedules. In the current article, we provide a task analysis for creating both simple and complex digital activity schedules using Google Slides, a freely available, web-based technology that operates on a variety of digital platforms. We also provide suggestions for how behavior analysts can train parents to use this technology with their children using telehealth procedures.",

First, scanned or photographic images of activities could be easily moved around within activity schedules, reducing the cost and effort of printing and laminating images for inclusion in binder-based or single-page printed schedules. Second, digital schedules could easily be shared across multiple devices. For example, copies of the schedule could be updated by a teacher or therapist and then e-mailed to a parent for use at home. Finally, tablet computers are now ubiquitous in school, work, and home settings, thus reducing potential stigmatization for digital activity schedule users.",

One published study has also indicated that, for some participants, digital activity schedules may be preferred over binderbased schedules (Giles & Markham, 2017) . Although further research on the use of digital activity schedules is certainly warranted, a sufficient body of research exists to demonstrate the potential benefits of this technology. Given the portability of digital activity schedules and the potential for behavior analysts to be able to design digital activity schedules and transmit them electronically to parents or caregivers for use with their children at home, we believe that they are ideally suited to the current therapeutic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which limits direct contact between behavior analysts and the clients and families with whom they work. Thus, the purpose of this article is to provide a detailed task analysis that both behavior analysts and parents can use to create and modify digital activity schedules using Google Slides, a freely available, web-based program that works on a variety of digital devices and platforms.",

Beginning activity schedules are usually composed of at least two to three activity pages plus a terminal reinforcer page (typically a small amount of a preferred edible) at the end. Additional activities can be added as the learner demonstrates mastery of the schedule to form progressively longer response chains. The sequence of activities should be changed frequently to ensure that the learner's behavior comes under the control of the pictures displayed as opposed to becoming a sequence of rote behaviors under proprioceptor control of sensations repeated in a performance chain.",

They could also be placed directly on the table if it is large enough to hold all materials and still have a clear work space to complete activities. Alternatively, materials could be placed on the floor near the table. When learners are first beginning to use activity schedules, the idea is to have the materials close at hand to reduce travel time and the potential for distraction. Once learners have mastered the basic components of activity schedule following, materials can be placed in their natural locations.",

The only verbal instruction given to the learner should be the initial instruction to begin completing the schedule (e.g., \"It's time to do your activity schedule. Here you go!\"). After that, the person assisting the learner to follow the schedule should not provide any additional verbal instructions, verbal prompts, or conversation until the schedule is completed (unless one of the included activities is a social activity during which verbal interaction would be appropriate). The amount of physical prompting provided will depend on each individual learner's abilities but will often begin with hand-over-hand guidance that should be provided in a way that allows the learner to complete the schedule with as few errors as possible. This physical guidance should be faded as quickly as possible to avoid prompt dependence. A typical fading sequence would begin with hand-over-hand guidance that is progressively faded to physical prompts at the wrist, forearm, elbow, and shoulder, followed by gradually increased physical distance between the prompter and the learner. We have found that light physical prompts from behind at the shoulders are particularly effective for guiding learners back and forth between the schedule and the activity materials. Fading can take place dynamically within sessions or can be scripted across sessions. One practical method for prompt fading that has been particularly useful when parents are the primary implementers is that used by Gerencser et al. (2017) , where test sessions are periodically run using a 5-s prompt delay procedure to determine the steps a learner can complete independently. Prompts that the learner needed to complete the task are recorded on a data sheet, which then serves as a teaching guide for sessions until the next test session is conducted (see the Appendix, Fig.  28 , for a sample data sheet). Behavior analysts who have the capacity to view sessions live through videoconference technology could also provide parents with fading suggestions in real time.",

If the learner begins to drift off task or begins to engage in stereotypy with schedule materials, the implementer/prompter should simply interrupt this behavior and physically redirect the learner to complete the activity correctly. However, if the learner obtains the incorrect materials after touching the picture representing those materials, he or she should be redirected back to the schedule, physically prompted to touch the picture of the materials again, and physically guided to obtain the correct materials. This helps ensure that learner behavior comes under the control of the schedule.",

            "text": "Once learners have mastered following basic activity schedules with brief, close-ended activities, more complex activities can be introduced. For example, implementers can add choice pages in which the learner can select from two or more available activities. On a close-ended activity schedule that a learner previously mastered, choice pages could be added to the schedule to replace one or more of the close-ended activities. Learners can also be taught to set and respond to digital timers using visual cues in order to include open-ended activities in the digital schedule. Red circles representing the number of minutes for the activity and a green circle representing the start button are placed below the picture of the open-ended activity. The minute button on the digital timer is also colored red and the start/stop button colored green. The learner is physically prompted to touch each circle below the picture and the corresponding colored button on the timer to set and start the timer. Responding to these more complex activity schedule pages can often be taught via graduated guidance within activity schedule sessions. If a learner requires more practice, modeling and teaching sessions with timers and choice pages could occur outside of activity schedule sessions (Higbee & Sellers, 2017; McClannahan & Krantz, 1999) .",

To replace pictures in any of the pages, select the large transparent rectangle and move it out of the way. Then edit or replace pictures and place the large transparent rectangle back in place. To test and ensure all pages and features are working correctly, we suggest selecting the Present icon (Fig. 12) to navigate and interact with the slides as the client would to check for errors.

Whereas much of this body of research has investigated the use of binder-based or single-page paper activity schedules, in recent years, researchers have demonstrated that technology-based digital schedules can also be effective and, in some circumstances, preferred by learners (Giles & Markham, 2017) . Digital activity schedules have multiple potential advantages that make them well suited to situations such as the current COVID-19 crisis, during which face-to-face contact between behavior analysts and their clients and families may be reduced or eliminated. Another possible advantage includes the relative ease with which they can be modified and the potential for behavior analysts to create and disseminate digital activity schedules electronically. The task analysis included in this article may be a useful tool as behavior analysts create and disseminate digital activity schedules.",
