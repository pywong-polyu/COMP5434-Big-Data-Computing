Twelve different UTM/VTM liquid samples were added at different dilutions to the extraction buffer, and 2 of 12 generated false-positive results. To understand the cause of these false-positive results, the effect of extraction buffer dilution on sample pH, surfactant concentration, and ionic strength were investigated. The most important factor in UTM/VTM liquid sample dilution of the extraction buffer was ionic strength as measured by conductivity. Dilutions with conductivity below ~17 mS/cm can induce a false-positive result. It was also noted that the ionic strength of UTM/VTMs can vary, and those with low ionic strength can be problematic. To rule out the effect of other common components found in UTMs/VTMs, several materials were mixed with extraction buffer and tested at high concentrations. None was shown to produce false-positive results.",

Rapid antigen testing requires the acquisition of sample via swab followed by extraction of the viral particles to release the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) antigen. The extracted sample is then placed in the sample well of the test device, and the results can be detected visually or instrument-read.",

Alternative sample types such as saliva, oral fluid, gargle and wash, and breath are being investigated. 2 It is preferable that the sample swabs be tested immediately (or within an hour). However, in some cases, particularly for retrospective evaluations of these rapid antigen tests, these swabs, which are also used for RT-PCR testing, are stored in either universal transport medium (UTM) or viral transport medium (VTM). In these cases, the sample swab is placed in 1 to 3 mL of UTM/VTM. These sample types are problematic in that some manufacturers (e.g., Becton Dickinson, Healgen, and Abbott) do not support the use of UTM/VTMs, other manufacturers (e.g., AccessBio, SD Biosensor, and Quidel) recommend specific UTM/VTMs, and some manufacturers (e.g., Quidel) specify that certain UTM/VTM products should not be used. [2] [3] [4] [5] It is important for rapid antigen manufacturers to understand how UTM/VTM samples may affect assay performance. 6 The major issues with these samples are swab sample dilution (e.g., decreased analyte concentration), swab sample dilution on extraction buffer components (surfactant, pH, and ionic strength), and UTM/VTM formulations (e.g., fetal calf serum, bovine serum albumin, gelatin, amino acids, metabolites, and dyes). To understand how UTM/VTM samples affect the performance of the Healgen rapid antigen test, we performed three different studies: 1) a dilution study using several different UTM/VTMs, 2) a study to determine the impact of UTM/VTM liquid sample dilution on the surfactant concentration of the viral extraction solution, pH, and ionic strength, and 3) a study to investigate concentrations of UTM/VTM components.",

Buffer at pH 7 and 8 was prepared with and without the additives. Solutions with both additives yielded negative results at pH 7 and 8. The addition of surfactant without salt resulted in false positives at both pH 7 and 8. The absence of surfactant with salt produced negative test results at both pH 7 and 8. Absence of both additives also produced a positive test line at both pH levels. Solutions without salt added generated false-positive results, suggesting a critical role for ionic strength. False-positive results due to the absence of sodium chloride suggest that extraction buffer ionic strength measured as conductivity (mS/cm) may play a role in reducing nonspecific interactions. To test this hypothesis, several samples were prepared with conductivity ranging from high to low by mixing assay extraction buffer with ultrapure water (measured conductivity = 0.15 mS/cm) and 0.9% saline (measured conductivity = 17 mS/cm). Volume ratios tested were determined based on potential use cases for samples stored in VTM or buffer. Ultrapure water represents the most extreme case, where the initial sample conductivity is very low. Saline samples represent cases where samples are stored in a higher-conductivity solution. Results of three replicates and two rapid antigen test reagent lots are shown in Tables 3 and 4 below. Samples with conductivity below ~17.5 mS/cm generated false-positive test results. As expected, mixing extraction buffer (EB) with water, the low-conductivity solution, generated false positives at a dilution of 2:3 (sample:EB). There were small differences between this cutoff for the two lots tested, suggesting some variability. Mixing saline, a higher-conductivity sample, with extraction buffer resulted in no false positives when mixed up to 2:1 (sample:EB). In each ratio, the conductivity of the final solution .

Some manufacturers use relatively high volumes (e.g., 350-400 \u00b5L) of VTM sample to compensate for original sample dilution, thereby improving analytical sensitivity, but this practice could negatively affect the Healgen assay. 3, 5 In fact, during an evaluation of the Healgen rapid antigen test by Charit\u00e9 Hospital, it was noted that the assay exhibited cross-reactivity with seven respiratory non-COVID-19 samples (e.g., adenovirus, entero/rhinovirus, influenza A H1, influenza A H3, and parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3). This was inconsistent with the internal crossreactivity data generated at Healgen. The authors concluded that one possible cause for the false positives was nonspecific binding. In some cases, duplicate tests of the positive results were performed, which resulted in the expected negative result. 8 To better understand results generated with UTM/VTM, we screened 12 different materials and found at least 2 that gave a weak false-positive result at 1:1 dilution. Interestingly, none of the materials generated false positives when tested with a 1:6 dilution (i.e., 50 \u00b5L of sample:300 \u00b5L of extraction buffer). The false-positive results generated with a 1:1 dilution revealed that either dilution of the extraction buffer or material present in the UTM/VTM was the source. Both possibilities were examined thoroughly.",

            "text": "We performed a second study to determine the impact of UTM/VTM liquid samples on the pH, surfactant concentration, and ionic strength. The extraction buffer plays several key roles in assay performance, and when it is mixed with stored liquid samples, the composition can change. The surfactant compounds are key to lysing virus particles (and subsequently inactivating them) and releasing the nucleocapsid protein, making it accessible to the antibodies used in the assay. These compounds also help to reduce nonspecific interactions between the gold sol conjugates and the test and control line antibodies. The pH of the buffer is critical for maintaining a consistent overall charge on all the relevant protein species (e.g., antigen, conjugate, and test and control line antibodies). The ionic strength or salt concentration of the buffer also creates an environment in which nonspecific electrostatic interactions are reduced. Any disruption of these factors may introduce unwanted results. The key finding here is that it appears that ionic strength is the most important factor affecting assay performance with respect to false-positive results using stored samples.",

            "text": "This study was expanded to look at dilution studies with saline and water on two different reagent lots. The water dilution showed the worst-case scenario, as the conductivity of water is very low (C = 0.15 mS/cm). Even at a dilution of 1:1 (water:EB), false-positive results begin to occur. The observed lot differences may be due to slight variation in extraction buffer composition or preparation of the samples tested. Viral samples are not recommended to be stored in water solution for any type of testing; this condition represents an extreme dilution of UTM/VTM samples with water to increase the sample volume for multiple rapid antigen test evaluations and could be problematic. The results of the saline dilution study were more favorable due to the higher conductivity of the 0.9% saline alone (C = 16-17 mS/cm). No false positives were observed when saline was mixed with extraction buffer, even up to 2:1 (saline:EB). Saline is a common way to store viral swabs and provides enough ionic strength to reduce false-positive results. The conductivity measurements from this study have also shown that an approximate cutoff point for false-positive generation with this test is 17 mS/cm. The findings from the UTM/VTM screening and buffer components study suggested that there may be differences in the conductivity between UTM/VTM from different sources. We measured four materials that have conductivity ranging from about 3-15 mS/cm. This indicates some variability in VTM based on the formula for those materials. The objective of storing swabs in VTM is to preserve and protect the organism for future use, either for cell culture or, most likely in the case of SARS-CoV-2 samples, molecular testing. Different UTM/VTMs have unique purposes, and their formulations reflect those needs. In the case of the Healgen rapid antigen testing, the UTM/VTM with the lowest conductivity caused a weak false-positive result at the 1:1 dilution as expected based on conductivity measurements.",
