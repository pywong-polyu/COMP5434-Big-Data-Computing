In Sweden, whilst some persons over age 70 live in residential care centres, most of them receive home care services instead. About 8% of all subjects 65 years or older and 23% of all subjects 80 years or older receive care at home [11] . In January 2020, almost 80 000 persons were living at residential care centres, whilst about 190 000 people over age 70 had received home care services in Sweden [12] .

The number of employees at the companies ranged from 27 to 291 (Table 1 ). The study did not specifically inquire about symptoms, but the rules were clear that employees were not allowed to work if they had symptoms. Home help services were given in the homes of the old subjects. Services included help with personal hygiene, nutrition, household chores such as cleaning and errands, for example food stores, pharmacies or post office. The actual precautions taken to prevent spread may have differed between companies and may never be fully known. A resume by one of us ( A.S.) may serve as an illustrative example: the situation was characterized by shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and widespread notions that face masks did not work and that only symptomatic subjects were infectious. An initial guideline stipulating the use of face masks, visors and aprons was after a few days replaced by a guideline stipulating to only use face masks, and these were made available only if the old person had symptoms. A local dentist volunteered face masks, but we had to reuse them for multiple customers. We made visors from overhead sheets attached to elastic bands. Volunteers provided aprons. When travelling, scarfs covered our faces. There were rules restricting visits to old persons at institutions, but they did not apply to old persons at home. As far as we could see, neither relatives nor the ambulatory nurses administrating daily drugs (e.g. insulin) used PPE.",

Indeed, a substantial proportion of PCR-positive subjects either were seropositive or had very low amounts of virus (signs of a previous infection or a lingering infection after resolution of symptoms).
