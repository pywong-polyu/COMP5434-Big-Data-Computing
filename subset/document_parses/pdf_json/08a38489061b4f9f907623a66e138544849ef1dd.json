            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 triage questionnaire in obstetric patients symptoms, such as loss of smell or taste, may also have played an important role [3, 29] . Olfactory and taste disorders have been reported as the only symptoms of infection in up to 17% of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, and to display a higher predictive ability of having the virus than fever or persistent cough [16, 18, 19] . Isolated loss of smell or taste was identified in 15.7% of our virally infected patients. In addition, frequency of olfactory and taste disorders did not differ between the two study periods, whereas that of fever and cough displayed a substantial reduction (Fig 2A and 2B) . These data suggest that patients' assessment upon admission during an outbreak by a novel air-tract pathogen should include not only major respiratory but also minor symptoms, especially in the more advanced phases of the outbreak. Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity at more than 2 weeks from symptom onset has been reported in infected individuals [30, 31] . Overall, we identified 51 women with SARS--CoV-2 infection, and in 17 (33.3%) questionnaire upon admission was deemed negative. However, 6 (35.3%) of these patients reported symptoms suggestive of infection more than 14 but within 30 days before hospital admission. Had the questionnaire investigated a one-month time-frame, negative predictive values would have increased to 98.2% and 98.6% in the targeted and the universal viral screening period, respectively. Of note, whether such patients would have been infectious and thus able to spread the virus at the time of admission is still a matter of debate [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Similarly, the infectiousness of fully asymptomatic women with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results is unclear [31, 33, [36] [37] [38] . Unfortunately, we could not address this issue in our patients since we did not perform viral culture experiments [33, 34] . Nonetheless, independent of the infectiousness potential of these women, widespread use of face masks and frequent hand sanitization have likely contributed to successful viral spread control in our units [21, 22] .",
