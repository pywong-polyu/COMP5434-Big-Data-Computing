This comparison may have been because of its worldwide spread via respiratory particles and similar initial clinical presentation [3, 4] . For both infections, the most common symptoms are cough, fever, dyspnoea or headache. However, COVID-19 appears more deleterious than influenza [5] as intensive care units (ICUs) were stressed, elective procedures were reduced, and national lockdowns resulted in considerable economic hardship for parts of the population.",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and in particular several of its variants appear to be more contagious than the influenza virus, with a reproductive number of 2-2.5, and contagious even in patients without symptoms or before symptoms appear [3] . Moreover, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), in unvaccinated populations 15% of COVID-19 cases might need hospitalisation and 5% of hospitalised patients require ventilation [3] . In comparison, a study from Germany of 34,493 patients with influenza found that 3.7% of these patients needed hospitalisation, and 5% of these received invasive ventilation [24] . In our study, 13.9% of the hospitalised patients with COVID-19 needed mechanical ventilation, compared to 4.7% of the hospitalised patients with influenza.

This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the patients with COVID-19 were less likely to have some of the comorbidities than patients with influenza. However, all the clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 were worse than those for patients with influenza and persisted even after adjustment for possible confounders. The WHO estimates case fatality rates of 3-4% for COVID-19, whereas the infection fatality rates for seasonal influenza are usually much lower, around 0.1% [2] . In our Swiss hospital surveillance, the cumulative incidence of mortality of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 up to day 30 was 11.4% compared with 3.6% in hospitalised influenza patients.

In the presented analysis, only data from two seasons -2018/19 (n = 1,010) and 2019/20 (n = 371) -were available. In addition, detection bias of in-hospital influenza cases cannot fully be excluded. In this regard, a difference was noted between university hospitals and non-university hospitals: detection of influenza cases was statistically significant more frequently in university hospitals. This may hint at a need for more stringent case detection for COVID-19, especially in non-university hospitals. Therefore, some mild influenza cases may have been missed and this may have even led to an underestimation of the severity of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the main analysis was adjusted for type of hospital (university and other). Irrespective of hospital type, the results remained unchanged. Another possible bias is related to missing data. For about one-third of the patients in the database, comorbidity data were lacking because it was not mandatory for the surveillance. As missingness was centre-specific (missing at random) and only related to independent variables, we conducted complete case analyses for the primary outcome. The point-estimate of the analysis including all patients but excluding BMI and comorbidities from the propensity weights fell within the 95% CI of the main analysis, indicating that excluding incomplete cases did not introduce a major bias.",
