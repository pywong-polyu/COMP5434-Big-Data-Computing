The parameters of such models, e.g. kinetic rate constants, usually cannot be measured directly but need to be inferred from experimental data. In this article, we study dynamical models of the translation kinetics after mRNA transfection and analyze their parameter identifiability. Previous studies have considered ordinary di\u21b5erential equation (ODE) models of the process, and here we formulate a stochastic di\u21b5erential equation (SDE) model. For both model types, we consider structural identifiability based on the model equations and practical identifiability based on simulated as well as experimental data and find that the SDE model provides better parameter identifiability than the ODE model. Moreover, our analysis shows that even for those parameters of the ODE model that are considered to be identifiable, the obtained estimates are sometimes unreliable. Overall, our study clearly demonstrates the relevance of considering di\u21b5erent modeling approaches and that stochastic models can provide more reliable and informative results.",

            "text": "1 Introduction mRNA transfection is the process of introducing mRNA into a living cell. mRNA delivery has become increasingly interesting for biomedical applications because it enables treatment of diseases by means of targeted expression of proteins and it is transient, avoiding the risk of permanently integrating into the genome (see e. g. Sahin et al., 2014) . One of the most prominent applications of mRNA transfection at the moment are the mRNA-based vaccine candidates that are already in use or currently under investigation to prevent COVID-19 infections (Borah et al., 2021 , DeFrancesco, 2020 . In such a context, it is, of course, very import to have a precise understanding of the dynamics of the underlying processes in order to be able to control them. Yet, many aspects and the determinants of the mRNA delivery process and the translation kinetics are di cult to measure and therefore poorly understood.",

The data comes from an mRNA transfection experiment using fluorescence reporters and fluorescence microscopy which is one of the few ways to measure quantities within a living cell over time (i. e. keeping it alive is necessary). Due to the discrete nature of the molecular species within a cell and due to the fact that random fluctuations play a key role (Elowitz et al., 2002 , Raj & van Oudenaarden, 2008 , a continuous-time, discrete-space Markov process, also called a Markov jump process (MJP), for which the dynamics are described by the so-called chemical master equation (CME), is widely accepted to be an appropriate stochastic description of the biochemical processes within a cell (Gillespie, 1992 , Schnoerr et al., 2017 . However, parameter inference for MJPs is computationally very demanding and often infeasible (see e. g. Warne et al., 2019) . Therefore, several other representations of the biochemical kinetics have been developed.",

(2009) , however for an experimental setup that also included the transcription process. Finkenst\u00e4dt et al.

This article is structured as follows: In Section 2, we describe the experimental data that motivated the study. In Section 3, we present the biochemical reaction network which we want to consider for the translation kinetics after mRNA transfection and formulate its ODE and SDE representation. After stating the assumed model of the observations and summarizing the parameters that we would like to infer from these observations in Section 4, we consider several approaches to assess structural identifiability of the parameters for both model types in Section 5. We define the parameter posteriors for both modeling approaches and study the practical identifiability of the parameters based on simulated and experimental data in Section 6, and conclude with a summary and discussion of our findings in Section 7.

We analyze the structural identifiability which only considers the model equations of the process dynamics and the observation equation (not the actual data) and assumes that we are in a perfect data situation, i. e. we have an infinite amount of data observed without measurement error (Raue et al., 2009) . Plainly speaking, structural identifiability analysis answers the question whether di\u21b5erent parameter combinations can lead to the same model output. While for ODE models, there are analytical methods to assess structural identifiability, no such methods exit for SDE models. Therefore, we consider several approaches that do not directly assess the structural identifiability for our SDE model, but answer related questions. In the following subsections, we consider a transformed version of both model types, we make use of a surrogate model and the open source software DAISY as has recently been suggested by Browning et al.

We use the transformed models from the previous subsection for the identifiability analysis. For the ODE model in Equation (4), the analysis with DAISY is straight forward since it is intended for the use for ODE models. After applying DAISY, the obtained output shows that when considering the set of parameters {\u2713, m 0 , scale, o\u21b5set}, the model is non-identifiable. The DAISY output also reveals that this non-identifiability is due to the fact that the parameters \u2713 1 and \u2713 3 are only locally identifiable and the parameters \u2713 2 , m 0 , and scale are not individually identifiable, but only their product is.

Using DAISY, we obtain that the surrogate model is globally identifiable, i. e. all six parameter values could be uniquely determined if we were able to observe the moments M 01 and M 02 directly, infinitely long over time, and without measurement error. While this implies that the parameters are structurally identifiable from moment measurements, it does not directly answer our original question of whether the parameters of the SDE model can be identified from perfect observations of a single fluorescence trajectory. Moreover, as has already been pointed out, structural identifiability analysis assumes a perfect data situation. From its results, we cannot conclude that the parameters will be identifiable from the actual experimental data (which is always finite and usually subject to measurement error). In contrast, the notion of practical identifiability is concerned with the question whether the parameters can be determined from a specific data set (Raue et al., 2009 ) and we will address this question in Section 6.",

Again, the SDE trajectories do behave di\u21b5erently for the di\u21b5erent parameter combinations.

The data was simulated with Gillespie's algorithm with parameters \u2713 = (0.2, 0.32, 0.01), m 0 = 240, t 0 = 0.96, scale = 1.8, and o\u21b5set = 8.5 over a time interval of 30 hours which yields trajectories similar to the experimental data, and we use the fluorescence intensity at 181 equidistant time points as observations to mirror the structure of the experimental data. The simulated fluorescence intensity (without measurement error) is depicted by the blue dotted line on the right hand side of Figure 5 . We use Stan to sample from the posterior distributions of the ODE model and the SDE model given the simulated data. Since we assume the data to be observed without measurement error, the parameter o\u21b5set can be determined directly from the first observation. Therefore, we do not include measurement error (and thus the parameter ) and the parameter o\u21b5set in the posterior distribution of the SDE model. Whereas for the ODE model, deviations of the observed data from the deterministic ODE trajectory have to be attributed to measurement error; therefore, the parameter has to be included in the posterior distribution of the ODE model. We also include the parameter o\u21b5set for the ODE model in order to avoid degeneracy of the posterior. For the SDE model, we use the mean estimate of t 0 obtained from the sample for the ODE model as the fixed value of t 0 . We assume the following prior distributions: \u2713 i \u21e0 N 0 (0, 5 2 ) for i = 1, 2, 3, m 0 \u21e0 N 0 (300, 300 2 ), scale \u21e0 U(0, 30), where N a (\u00b5, \u2318 2 ) denotes the normal distribution truncated from below by a, and additionally for the ODE model, o\u21b5set \u21e0 U(0, 30), \u21e0 U(0.001, 10), and t 0 \u21e0 U(0, 30). For both model types, we generate 8 HMC chains of 5000 iterations and discard the first half of the iterations as warm-up. Thus, we use a posterior sample of size 20,000 for each model type in the subsequent analysis. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the Stan output of the posterior samples for the ODE and the SDE model, respectively, and also include the true parameter values that were used to simulate the data for comparison. The tables also contain the 2.5%-, 50%-, and 97.5%-quantiles of the samples. We use the interval between the 2.5%-and the 97.5%-quantile as an estimate of the 95%-credible interval (CI). For the ODE model, we see that the parameters o\u21b5set and t 0 are well estimated since mean and median of the sample correspond to the true value, the CIs are very narrow, the e\u21b5ective sample size (ESS) n e\u21b5 is high andR is equal to 1. As expected, the measurement error parameter is estimated to be higher than the true value of zero.

Our analysis in Section 5 already showed that for the ODE model, these two parameters are only locally identifiable and the posterior distribution is symmetric with respect to them in the case of identical priors for both parameters. This is also apparent in the density plots in Figure 6 . The density estimates of the posterior sample for the ODE model are clearly bimodal. The reason that the two modes are not exactly symmetric here is that HMC chains usually are only able to explore one mode and in our example 5 out of the 8 chains happen to end up in the mode where \u2713 1 is higher than \u2713 3 while only 3 chains converge to the other mode. The fact that each chain only samples from one of the modes is also the reason for the extremely low ESSs and the very high values ofR for \u2713 1 and \u2713 3 in Table 1 . Moreover, note that neither of the modes and not even the ranges of all values in the posterior sample cover the true parameter values of \u2713 1 and \u2713 3 . For the SDE model on the other hand, Figure 6 and Table 2 show that the posterior density is clearly unimodal with respect to \u2713 1 and \u2713 3 , the 95% CI are narrow and cover the true parameter values, mean and median of the sample are close or equal to the true values, and high ESSs andR values equal to 1 are achieved.

For the ODE, at most the product \u2713 2 m 0 scale is identifiable. This is also apparent from the results presented in Table 1 and Figure 7 . For the individual parameters and also for all products of two out of the three parameters, the 95% CIs are extremely broad and the mean and median as ESSs andR values equal to 1 achieved is that the variation within each of the HMC chains is very high and thus does not di\u21b5er substantially from the variation between the chains for these parameters as can be seen in the traceplots of the chains in Section A.4.1 of the supplementary material. For the product \u2713 2 m 0 scale of all three parameters, the 95% CI is very narrow for the posterior sample of the ODE model and also the ESS is high andR equal to 1. Without knowing the true parameter values, one would assume that this product is well estimated. However, the 95% CI and even the whole range of the sample do not cover the true value. For the SDE model, the 95% CI for the product \u2713 2 m 0 scale is broader, but it covers the true parameter value and also the mean and the median as point estimates are closer to the true value than the mean and the median for the ODE model. Moreover, the ESS is quite high andR is equal to 1 for the SDE model. We therefore conclude that the product \u2713 2 m 0 scale is identifiable. The generally lower ESSs are due to the fact that for the SDE model, we sample from a distribution of much larger dimension as explained in Section 6.1. Additionally, for the SDE model, the parameters scale and \u2713 2 m 0 have narrow 95% CIs (especially compared to those for the ODE model) that include the true parameter values, high ESSs, andR values of 1 and can therefore be considered identifiable. The remaining parameters \u2713 2 , m 0 , \u2713 2 scale, and m 0 scale have rather broad 95% CIs and only achieve low ESSs andR values higher than 1.02. Hence, they seem to be non-identifiable.

We have simulated another 99 trajectories with the same parameters and performed Stan sampling in the same way as described in the beginning of this subsection. For each model type and each posterior sample of the di\u21b5erent simulated trajectories, we calculate the length of the 95% CI and determine the median and the coe cient of variation (c.v.) over these lengths for each model type. Also, we rescale the lengths of the 95% CI by dividing by the true parameter value and again determine the median of the normalized quantities. The rescaling is done to transfer the values to a more similar scale. Note, however, that the values are nevertheless not directly comparable between di\u21b5erent parameters. Moreover, we check whether the true parameter value that was used to simulate the data is included in the 95% CI. Table 3 shows the aggregated results for the posterior samples of all 100 trajectories and also includes the length of the interval between the 2.5%-and the 97.5%-quantile of the prior distributions. Except for the parameters m 0 and \u2713 2 m 0 scale, the median length of the 95% CIs for the SDE model is always smaller than for the ODE model. For parameter \u2713 2 m 0 scale, the CI lengths are a lot smaller for the ODE model; however, the CIs cover the true parameter value only 13 out of 100 times while for the SDE model, the true value is covered 93 times. For the other parameters that we classified as identifiable for the SDE model in the analysis of the individual trajectory (i. e. \u2713 1 , \u2713 3 , scale, and \u2713 2 m 0 ), the median length of the 95% CIs is clearly smaller for the SDE model than for the ODE model and the true parameter value is covered at least 91 out of 100 times for the SDE model. For parameter m 0 , the CI lengths are high for both model types because the parameter is not identifiable for either model type. For the other parameters that we classified as not identifiable for both model types in the analysis of the individual trajectory (i. e. \u2713 2 , \u2713 2 scale, and m 0 scale), the median length of 95% CIs is clearly smaller for the SDE model than for the ODE model, at least by a factor of 4.",

The desirable region of value combinations is in the bottom right corner of the graph where the number of CIs covering the true value is high and the median rescaled CI length is small. Note that, clearly, more importance should be given to high numbers of CIs covering the true value as it is useless to be very certain about a parameter estimate (indicated by a short CI) while the correct value is not included in the CI. However, even for parameters that are identifiable, we do not expect to obtain a coverage of the true value of 100% since we are considering 95% CIs. Therefore, values of 100 rather tend to hint at non-identifiability. In Figure 8 , we can see that for the majority of the parameters, the triangles representing the value combinations for the SDE model are closer to the desirable region. Only for parameter m 0 (which is not identifiable for either model type), the value combinations are almost the same for both model types. And as we already pointed out for the product \u2713 2 m 0 scale, the median length of the 95% CIs is smaller for the ODE model; however, a lot fewer CIs cover the true parameter value for the ODE model than for the SDE model.

Also, the parameter o\u21b5set is well estimated for both model types but with a more narrow 95% CI for the SDE model. The parameter is accurately determined for the SDE model as well. For the ODE model, is again overestimated. Figure 9 visualizes the components of the posterior samples for parameters \u2713 1 , \u2713 3 , o\u21b5set, and . Again, the bimodality of the posterior with respect to \u2713 1 and \u2713 3 is apparent for the ODE model and neither the 95% CIs nor the ranges of the sample cover the true parameter values. For the SDE model on the other hand, the distribution is unimodal and the 95% CIs do cover the true parameter values for \u2713 1 and \u2713 3 . However, their 2-dimensional smoothed scatter plot in Figure 9 does not show a simple elliptic shape (as for the simulated data without measurement error) but almost a banana-like shape. This may also be the reason for the deteriorated sampling e ciency discernible from the low ESSs and higherR-values in Table 5 . Figure 9 visualizes the components of the posterior samples for parameters \u2713 2 , m 0 , scale, and their products. For the ODE model, again only the product \u2713 2 m 0 scale is identifiable in the sense that the corresponding 95% CI is very narrow, the ESS is high, and theR-value is equal to 1. However, the 95% CI again does not cover the true parameter value. For the SDE model, the 95% CI for \u2713 2 m 0 scale is broader but it does contain the true value. Also, the ESS is high and theR-value is close to 1. Moreover, the parameters scale and \u2713 2 m 0 have narrow 95% CIs, high ESSs, andR-values close to 1 for the SDE model, and thus, we conclude that they are identifiable.

There, we present the same posterior samples as used in this and the previous subsection. But instead of comparing the posterior samples between the two model types, the posterior samples are compared between the simulated data without and with measurement error for each model type separately. In summary, we find that for the SDE model, the 95% CIs increase for almost all parameters except m 0 for data with measurement error. Whereas for the ODE model, there is hardly any di\u21b5erence for most of the parameters between the posterior samples for the data without and with measurement error since the majority of the parameters is not identifiable anyway. The marginal posterior samples for the parameters o\u21b5set, t 0 , and \u2713 2 m 0 scale are only slightly a\u21b5ected by the measurement error. Only the marginal posterior sample of the measurement error parameter is substantially a\u21b5ected and, as expected, consists of higher values for data with measurement error. Table 6 and Figure 11 display the statistics of the posterior samples aggregated over the 100 simulated trajectories. Similar to the results for the simulated data without measurement error, the median length of the 95% CIs for the SDE model is always smaller than for the ODE model, except for the parameters m 0 and \u2713 2 m 0 scale and additionally (which was not included for the SDE model in the previous subsection).

For the parameter o\u21b5set, the median CI length is slightly higher for the ODE model than for the SDE model, however, the CIs for the ODE model also contain the true parameter value more often. So for this parameter, the ODE model, for once, shows the preferable result. ",

Only for parameters \u2713 1 , \u2713 2 , and \u2713 2 m 0 scale, this is not the case. Note in particular that for the parameters \u2713 2 m 0 and scale, which are non-identifiable for the ODE model (also apparent from the very long CIs here), the median length of the 95% CI for the SDE model is again much smaller compared to that of the ODE and to that of the prior. This indicates that these two parameters are identifiable for the SDE model also for the experimental data. That the uncertainty of the parameter estimate for \u2713 2 m 0 scale is greater for the SDE than for the ODE model is consistent with our results for the simulated data. The parameter \u2713 2 is considered to be non-identifiable for both model types and the di\u21b5erence between the median CI lengths is relatively small. Finally, for parameter \u2713 1 , we see that the result is more or less the same as for \u2713 3 for the ODE model due to the symmetry of the posterior distribution with respect to these two parameters. Whereas for the SDE model there is no symmetry and there is more variance in the posterior samples with respect to \u2713 1 than to \u2713 3 (indicated by a greater median CI length). The smaller median CI length of \u2713 1 for the ODE model compared to the SDE model is due to the fact that for many of the observed trajectories the values of \u2713 1 and \u2713 3 seem to be very close together. In this case, the posterior distribution of the ODE model appears to be unimodal (as the two modes overlap) and the posterior variance with respect to the two parameters is small (and equal due to the symmetry). Thus, overall this variance is smaller than the posterior variance with respect to \u2713 1 for the SDE model. ",

Our analysis using the structural identifiability of the momentequations-based surrogate model and a simulation based assessment suggest that the SDE model might lead to better parameter identifiability. The most systematic approach is the one based on the surrogate model and DAISY as suggested by Browning et al. (2020) ; however, it cannot help us confirm a di\u21b5erence in the parameter identifiability between the SDE and the ODE model. Especially because we are interested in the parameter identifiability based on one observed trajectory and the momentequations-based approach assumes that we were able to observe the first and the second moment of the fluorescence signal. Even when we take into account that we have several observed trajectories available from the experiment, these do not provide information about the moments because the initial time point t 0 of mRNA release is di\u21b5erent for every trajectory and also for the other parameters, in particular for m 0 , assuming that they are equal for all observed cells does not seem reasonable. By simulating from the SDE model, we were able to assess the di\u21b5erences in the variation within individual trajectories for di\u21b5erent parameter combinations. Again our results suggest that the SDE model provides better parameter identifiability. Unlike for the ODE model, the degradation rates \u2713 1 and \u2713 3 for the SDE model appear to be structurally globally identifiable. Also, scale and the product \u2713 2 m 0 seem to be structurally identifiable, but the individual parameters \u2713 2 and m 0 do not. While this simple simulation approach worked out well for the model considered here, one of its weak points is, of course, the somewhat subjective visual assessment of the variation within trajectories. A more quantitative approach to this would be to simulate a large number of trajectories (with very small time step) for every considered parameter combination, to approximate the quadratic variation for each trajectory, and then, to compare these values between individual trajectories started with the same seed for di\u21b5erent parameter combinations and to compare also the distributions of these values for di\u21b5erent parameter combinations. Another drawback of both simulation-based approaches is the fact that the analysis is based on a finite set of parameter combinations that can be considered; and thus, drawing general conclusions for the entire parameter space may be problematic. Moreover, we have assessed the practical parameter identifiability for both model types by sampling from the parameter posterior distribution given simulated data with and without measurement error and the experimental data published in Fr\u00f6hlich et al. (2018) . While our focus was on inference from individual fluorescence trajectories, using SDE mixed-e\u21b5ect modeling as done in Wiqvist et al. (2021) would be a meaningful extension, especially e. g. to obtain a common estimate for the parameter scale. We found that the parameters \u2713 1 and \u2713 3 are indeed globally identifiable for the SDE model given individual trajectories, unlike for the ODE model. And not only the product \u2713 2 m 0 scale but also the parameter scale and the product \u2713 2 m 0 are globally identifiable for the SDE model. Moreover, for the simulated data, the 95% CIs for the identifiable parameters for the SDE model covered the true parameter value adequately many times. Whereas for the ODE model, the true parameter values for the parameters \u2713 1 , \u2713 3 , and \u2713 2 m 0 scale were not covered by the 95% CIs for many of the posterior samples and were sometimes not even included in the range of values in the sample. The fact that the parameters \u2713 1 and \u2713 3 can be adequately determined using the SDE modeling approach given an individual trajectory renders the multi-experiment approach with di\u21b5erent mRNA constructs and the computationally intense hierarchical optimization algorithm used in Fr\u00f6hlich et al. (2018) unnecessary in the case that the determination of these parameters is the main objective. Besides, assuming that an MJP is the most appropriate description of the underlying dynamics, we saw that the estimated parameter values for a single cell trajectory based on the ODE model cannot be trusted even when narrow 95% CIs suggest low uncertainty. While the SDE model is clearly superior in terms of the information that we are able to extract from a single trajectory about the parameters that determine the dynamics of the underlying process, it has nevertheless several disadvantages. First of all, we were not able to include the estimation of the initial time point t 0 of mRNA release into the Stan sampling procedure due to technical/methodological limitations. Other sampling approaches such as particle MCMC (Golightly & Wilkinson, 2011) might alleviate this problem, but to our knowledge, no examples of inferring an unknown time point for SDE models have been investigated so far and would thus require further work. Another drawback of the SDE model are the higher computational costs as we need to sample from a higher-dimensional distribution (due to the random process values) than for the ODE model. For the SDE model, the sampling in our study takes on average almost 5.5 hours while for the ODE model, it averages at about 20 minutes. Note, however, that for the ODE model, the NUTS method implemented in Stan generated only chains that sample only from one of the posterior modes. Therefore, one might argue that sampling did not properly converge in this example. In general, estimation procedures for SDE models are more complex and unlike for ODE models, publicly available software tools are rare and usually not generally applicable. There is a clear need to further develop such tools for SDE models in order to harness their full potential, especially with regard to better identifiability of kinetic parameters. On the other hand, combining both modeling approaches as we have done here by first determining t 0 based on the ODE model and then estimating the kinetic parameters based on the SDE model is certainly also meaningful. Overall, our study clearly demonstrates the relevance of considering di\u21b5erent modeling approaches and of selecting the appropriate one. We expect to see stochastic models being used more frequently as increasing computing power becomes available and facilitates inference for such models. ",
