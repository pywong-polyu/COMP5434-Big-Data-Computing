As of July 23, 2021, according to the Coronavirus Resources Center at Johns Hopkins University, more than 192.7 million cases have been confirmed, while the number of deaths has risen to more than 4.139 million [2] . Given the circumstances and the measures needed to control the spread of the disease, government authorities were forced to take decisive actions, such as social distancing and mandatory isolation in homes, which have led to restrictions on various daily activities, with probable consequences on lifestyle, particularly affecting eating habits, physical activity, sleep quality, and mental health [3] .",

In this country, the first case of COVID-19 infection was reported by the government on March 6, 2020. Since then, the government has implemented a series of preventive measures in order to limit and contain the spread of the disease. On March 16, the Peruvian government, through Supreme Decree No. 008-2020-SA, declared a nationwide state of health emergency for a period of ninety (90) calendar days, dictating prevention measures and mandatory social isolation (national quarantine) for the control of COVID-19 [5] . Subsequently, the government announced an extension that modified the restriction to a targeted social isolation, but the state of health emergency and social distancing measures were extended repeatedly and currently are set until September 31, 2021 [6] . e period of social isolation due to COVID-19 has caused a series of changes in people's daily routine and lifestyle [7] . Available evidence has shown that during the pandemic, physical activity decreased in the population, while the amount of screen time increased significantly [7] . In fact, prior to the pandemic, these factors, along with obesity, were described as a public health problem in the Peruvian population, and COVID-19 may make this situation even worse [8] . In addition, studies have shown the negative impact of sedentary behaviors on physical and mental health [9] . Likewise, the fear caused by COVID-19 has an indirect effect, causing negative emotions and affecting the quality of sleep, contributing to an increase in obesity [10] .",

Indeed, improved lifestyle, as a possible strategy that includes regular physical activity, less screen time, adequate rest, and proper dietary habits through a diet based on consumption of minimally processed plant foods and healthy fats, would lead to better control of chronic noncommunicable diseases and thus strengthen the immune system during the COVID-19 pandemic [13] .",

Among the animal-based foods, only eggs (OR: 2.00, CI95% 1.52-2.65) presented significant consumption increase during social isolation. e consumption of alcoholic drinks and ultra-processed food was the lowest, while approximately 20% and 40% of sample presented high consumption of beverages and bakery products, respectively ( Figure 4 ). In the processed food, just bakery products (OR: 0.74, CI95% 0.56-0.97) presented change before and during social isolation. Additionally, to determine factors associated with BMI and sleep changes, a multivariate regression analysis was made.

In the adjusted analysis, PA at home (aOR:0.58, CI95%: 0.45-0.74) reduced the probability of high BMI by 42%, PA of less than 30 min until 1 hour reduced the probability of high BMI by 39% and 46%, respectively, and the addition of each day of PA reduced the probability of high BMI by 11%.

In the adjusted analysis, the social isolation for more than 61 days increased the probability of sleep changes by 2.31 times (aOR:2.31, CI95%: 1.57-3.38), while the addition of each additional meal in the day increased the probability of sleep changes by 17% (aOR: 1.17, CI95%: 1.05-1.32).

It is likely that women were more receptive to expressing psychological distress and somatic symptoms [35] . When the factors associated with alterations in sleep habits were analyzed, it was determined that the social isolation for more than 61 days increased the probability of sleep changes by 2.31 times. On the other hand, the uncertainty of being infected by the coronavirus would cause greater pressure in the population, relating to hypochondriacal concerns, sleep apnea, and childhood trauma that can be reflected in sleep mentality, affecting its quality [36] . Most of the participants in this study were students and workers under the age of 40, who probably had to change their activities from in-person to online, and these changes in their routines could have influenced and altered the physiological regulators of sleep.",

Some studies observed an improvement in the pattern of consumption of healthy foods and a restriction of unhealthy foods, especially in the younger population (<30 years) [37] . In contrast, studies in Italy indicated changes in eating habits in almost half the population so that women were more likely than men to increase their food intake to feel better [9] . In other countries, after-dinner snacks, carbohydrate consumption, consumption of sweets, cookies, and cakes and consumption of fresh food products increased [26] . e lack of dietary and eating restriction may be due to a response to stress and reduced physical activity, which could lead to decreased nutritional quality [26] . Additionally, the addition of each extra meal during the day increased the probability of sleep changes by 17%. is unhealthy behavior is observed in other studies, primarily in adult populations with obesity and in settings with a lower eating environment index [38] .",

Additionally, more than half indicated an increase in physical activity despite social isolation, where physical activity at home for at least 30 minutes per day and more days of practice per week significantly reduced the probability of high BMI. However, this study also showed that half of the participants reported weight gain. Future studies should consider additional potential factors, starting with the observation in this study that most participants had a changed sleep pattern during social isolation and potentially including other factors like stress, type of exercise, pedometer step counts, and portion sizes.",
