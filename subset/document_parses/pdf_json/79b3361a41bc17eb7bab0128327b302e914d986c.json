A challenge hospitals are faced with, in the fight against the virus, is the effective screening of incoming patients. One methodology is the assessment of chest radiography (CXR) images, which usually requires expert radiologists' knowledge. In this paper, we propose an explainable deep neural networks (DNN)-based method for automatic detection of COVID-19 symptoms from CXR images, which we call 'DeepCOVIDExplainer'. We used 16,995 CXR images across 13,808 patients, covering normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. CXR images are first comprehensively preprocessed, before being augmented and classified with a neural ensemble method, followed by highlighting class-discriminating regions using gradient-guided class activation maps (Grad-CAM++) and layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). Further, we provide human-interpretable explanations of the predictions. Evaluation results based on hold-out data show that our approach can identify COVID-19 confidently 1 with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89.61% and recall of 83%, improving over recent comparable approaches.

Although PCR tests offer many advantages over CXR and CT [2] , shipping the sample of patients is necessary, whereas X-ray or CT machines are readily available even in rather remote areas. In a recent study by K. Lee et al. [34] , CXR and CT images from nine COVID-19 infected patients were analyzed by two radiologists to assess the correspondence of abnormal findings on X-rays with those on CT images. The proportion of patients with abnormal initial radiographic findings was 78.3% to 82.4% for SARS and 83.6% for MERS, while being only 33% for COVID-19 cases [34] . Chest CT images, in contrast, showed double lung involvement in eight out of nine patients. In other words, X-ray may not be the best imaging method for detecting COVID-19, judging by the small cohort of nine patients [34] . Another study by Yicheng Fang et al. [8] , however, supports those findings and argues in favour of the effectiveness of CT over X-ray. CT should hence cautiously be considered as the primary imaging source for COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas [2] .

We pick VGG-16 and VGG-19 due to their general suitability for image classification. Based on the dense evaluation concept [30] , VGG variants convert the last three fully connected layers (FCLs) to 2D convolution operations to reduce the number of hyperparameters. We keep last 2 layers fixed to adopt a 1\u00d71 kernel, leaving the final one equipped with a Softmax activation.

Next, we pick ResNet-18 [33] ) and ResNet-34 [11] ) architectures. Apart from common building blocks, two bottlenecks are present in the form of channel reduction in ResNets. A series of convolution operators without pooling is placed in between, forming a stack. The first conv layer of each stack in ResNets (except for the first stack) are down-sampled at stride 2, which provokes the channel difference between identity and residual mappings. ResNets are lightweight stack-based CNNs, with their simplicity arising from small filter sizes (i.e., 3\u00d73) [30] . A series of convolution operators without pooling is then placed in between and recognized as a stack, as shown in fig. 1 .

Lastly, DenseNet-161 and DenseNet-201 architectures are picked.

In this case, even a high accuracy score can be achieved without predicting minor classes, hence might be uninformative.

Further, as Curtis Langlotz 11 stated \"AI won't replace radiologists, but radiologists who use AI will replace radiologists who don't\". In the same line, we would argue that 'DeepCOVIDExplainer' is not to replace radiologists but to be evaluated in a clinical setting and is by no means a suitable replacement for a human radiologists. We would even argue that human judgement is indispensable when the life of patients is at stake. However, we hope our findings will be a useful contribution to the fight against COVID-19 and towards an increasing acceptance and adoption of AI-assisted applications in the clinical practice. Lastly, we want to outline potential areas of enhancement: Firstly, since only a limited amount of CXR images for COVID-19 infection cases were at hand, it would be unfair to claim that we can rule out overfitting for our models. More unseen data from similar distributions is necessary for further evaluation to avoid possible out-of-distribution issues. Secondly, due to external conditions, we were yet not been able to verify the diagnoses and localization accuracies with the radiologists. Thirdly, accurate predictions do not only depend on single imaging modalities, but could also build up on additional modalities like CT and other decisive factors such as, e.g., patients demographic and symptomatic assessment report [31] . Nevertheless, we would argue that explaining predictions with plots and charts are useful for exploration and discovery [20] . Explaining them to patients may be tedious and require more humaninterpretable decision rules in natural language.
