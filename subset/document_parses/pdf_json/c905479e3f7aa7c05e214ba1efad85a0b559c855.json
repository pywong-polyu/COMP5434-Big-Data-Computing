In both plaque assays, a confluent monolayer of host cells is infected with serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 of unknown starting concentration. After adsorption, an immobilizing overlay is used to cover the infected monolayer, to prevent virus spread and restrict virus growth to foci of cells at the sites of initial infection. During incubation, zones of cell death develop as viral infection and replication are restricted to the surrounding monolayer, leading to plaque formation. After incubation, cells are stained to enhance the contrast between plaques and the uninfected monolayer. Plaques are then enumerated and used to calculate the titer of infectious virus in the specimen. The first plaque assay method that we describe (Basic Protocol) uses Noble agar as the matrix in a solid overlay and neutral red as the stain to enhance plaque visualization. The second plaque assay method that we describe (Alternate Protocol) uses carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as the matrix in a liquid overlay and crystal violet as the stain to enhance plaque visualization. An overview of these protocols is shown in Figure 1 . We believe that both of these protocols would be useful for quantifying infectious SARS-CoV-2 in viral stocks produced from infected cell supernatant.

These foci develop into plaques, which are visualized after the addition of a secondary S-OM containing neutral red, which is incorporated and bound by lysosomes in viable cells (Repetto, del Peso, & Zurita, 2008) .

In addition, liquid overlays can be applied to cell monolayers at room temperature, eliminating issues of re-solidification during the application process. However, the disadvantage of the liquid overlay matrix is that disruption of the liquid overlays can result in smeared plaques, and thus great care must be taken to prevent movement of plates during the incubation period. The fixation and subsequent staining with crystal violet used to enhance plaque visualization in the protocol has several advantages, including increased contrast between plaques from the purple monolayers, as well as the inactivation of the virus. In addition, fixation enables plates to be stored and plaques to be enumerated at a later time.
