However, ASD may contribute to deteriorating health in the presence of significant comorbidity and, thus, may need earlier closure. There is a lack of clarity regarding the indications for and outcomes after ASD closure in infancy and early childhood. We investigated the benefits and safety of surgical ASD closure in symptomatic patients under 2 years of age. Retrospective chart review was conducted in patients who underwent surgical ASD closure within the first 2 years of life. Of 31 symptomatic ASD patients, 22 had persistent respiratory symptoms, 24 failure to thrive, and 9 pulmonary hypertension. Overall, 26 patients (84.0%) showed clinical improvement after ASD closure, including improved respiratory status (17/22; 77.3%), resumption of normal growth (15/24; 62.5%), and resolution of pulmonary hypertension (7/7; 100%, 2 patients unable to assess postoperatively). Two medically complicated patients died a few months after surgery unrelated to surgical complications. Four out of 8 ventilator-dependent patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 1 month after ASD closure. Closure of ASD did not improve those patients with highly advanced lung disease and/or medically complex conditions including underlying genetic abnormalities. Surgical complications were uncommon. Postoperative hospital stay was 4 to 298 days (median 8 days). The majority of our patients demonstrated significant clinical improvement after ASD closure. Early ASD closure is safe and beneficial for symptomatic infants and young children with associated underlying pulmonary abnormalities, especially bronchopulmonary dysplasia.",

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital. Patients with ASD and either a small patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), partially anomalous pulmonary venous connection (in the setting of a sinus venosus ASD), or bicuspid aortic valve without significant hemodynamic abnormalities were included, whereas patients with other major concomitant congenital cardiac anomalies were excluded. Anatomical diagnosis was made primarily by echocardiogram. Inclusion criteria of \"symptomatic\" patients were based on the following definitions. The respiratory symptoms included: (a) the presence of baseline respiratory distress (tachypnea, retraction, hypoxia, apnea, increased work of breathing, or feeding difficulty); (b) persistent dependency on respiratory support including supplemental oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or positive pressure ventilation; or (c) recurrent respiratory illness requiring hospitalization at least twice a year. The respiratory symptoms were divided into two groups: (1) \"severe\" (ventilator-dependent) and (2) \"mild to moderate\" (spontaneous breathing). Failure to thrive was defined as either (a) persistent low weight below 3 standard deviations (SD) from the mean value for age without improvement or (b) suboptimal weight gain falling below a standard growth curve (growth charts by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 0 to 36 months: www.cdc. gov/growt hchar ts/). Pulmonary hypertension was defined as either (a) estimated RV pressure by tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet measurement by echocardiogram exceeding 2/3 of simultaneous systemic pressure, or cardiac catheterization findings of (b) mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) > 25 mmHg, (c) pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp) \u2265 3.5 U\u00b7m 2 , or (d) pulmonary vascular resistance/systemic vascular resistance (Rp/Rs) ratio \u2265 0.3.",

Fourteen patients were grouped as \"mild to moderate,\" consisting of clinical symptoms of congestive heart failure including tachypnea, retractions, and/or feeding difficulties (n = 8); mild supplemental oxygen dependence (n = 5); and recurrent respiratory infections (n = 1). After ASD closure, 92.9% (13/14) of mild-to-moderate respiratory symptoms resolved. Among 15 Three of 4 patients without clinical improvement in respiratory status after surgical ASD closure died of severe respiratory disease despite maximum supportive therapy (Table 4) . Pt 15 was an infant with trisomy 21 with severe BPD, cystolic fibrosis, and recurrent aspiration who was ventilationdependent before ASD closure. The support was withdrawn 145 days after ASD closure, as the family declined tracheostomy and further escalation of treatment. Pt 16 was a premature, low-birth-weight infant with Pierre-Robin sequence and cleft palate who underwent tracheostomy 9 months after ASD closure for chronic respiratory failure and who never recovered from the baseline pulmonary disability and died at 6 years of age at a chronic care facility. Pt 21 was a premature infant with trisomy 21, BPD, and chronic aspiration who underwent tracheostomy 3 months after ASD closure and who died of intractable lung disease 108 days after surgery. These deaths were not directly related to postoperative complications from surgical ASD closure.",

In our study, 80.6% of patients with respiratory symptoms had resolution after ASD closure (50% in severe cases and 92.9% in mild-to-moderate cases). Four of 5 patients who did not respond to ASD closure were those with advanced pulmonary disease with ongoing complex medical problems (Pts 7, 15, 16, and 21 in Table 5 ). Three of these 4 patients died (Table 4 ). Earlier surgery might have been beneficial for those patients with ASD and worsening respiratory status.

Reduction in pulmonary blood flow by closing ASD may facilitate natural improvement of BPD over time [18] . Resumption of normal growth was noted more frequently in the patients with respiratory symptoms. This finding is, in part, in agreement with the previous observation that non-cardiac reasons were frequently responsible for FTT in infants with ASD not associated with significant respiratory symptoms [19, 20] . Pulmonary hypertension was significantly reduced after surgical ASD closure in nearly all patients, as was previously reported [7, [21] [22] [23] . The patients with increased risk of postoperative pulmonary hypertension were managed with inhaled nitric oxide and/or sildenafil with favorable outcome. Fenestrated patch was applied in two cases with pulmonary hypertension (Pts 2 and 30) to prevent potential pulmonary hypertensive crisis. We did not encounter any cases with severe pulmonary vascular obstructive disease, as reported by others [17, 20] . According to the current American and European guidelines, ASD can be safely closed if R p /R s < 1/3 or Q p /Q s > 1.5 [24, 25] , but the surgical indications may be further liberated as there are more pulmonary vasodilators available in recent years [26] . Careful preoperative hemodynamic evaluation with or without preoperative medical treatment is warranted for all patients with severe pulmonary hypertension beyond these indications.",

Indeed, some sick infants with progressively worsening respiratory status (Pts 1 and 3 in Table 5 ) showed compelling clinical improvement after surgical ASD closure without postoperative complications. Due to significant improvement of intensive care management after open heart surgery in sick infants, the benefit of preventing chronic pulmonary complications by surgical ASD closure in young patients with underlying pulmonary abnormalities may prevail over the risk of potential shortterm surgical complications when the patients are not clinically improving despite maximum medical treatment and when percutaneous ASD device closure is not indicated.",

Ten patients were former premature infants, 2 were trisomy 21, and one had multiple congenital anomalies. Clinical indications for ASD closure include respiratory symptoms (n = 15), FTT (n = 10), pulmonary hypertension (n = 9), and multiple cerebral infarcts (n = 1). With ASD device closure, improvement of respiratory status, growth, and estimated pulmonary arterial pressure was noted in 60% (9/15), 40% (4/10), and 100% (9/9), respectively, which are essentially similar to the results after surgical ASD closure in this study. Collectively, our current data indicate that the elimination of excessive pulmonary blood flow by closing ASD in symptomatic infants and young children helps improve homodynamic status and ameliorate clinical symptoms regardless of the therapeutic modalities.",

First, this is a retrospective study in a single institution with a relatively small number of the patients with heterogenous backgrounds. Secondly, all symptomatic infants and young children with ASD underwent ASD closure in our hospital. Thus, there were no control symptomatic patients who were solely managed non-surgically without ASD closure. Instead, we compared the 3 clinical parameters before and after ASD closure and assessed the outcomes in an objective manner. Thirdly, pulmonary hypertension was not strictly defined in this study, and not all patients underwent diagnostic catheterization. Only 6 patients were diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension by cardiac catheterization, and 3 patients were diagnosed by echocardiogram only. Improvement of pulmonary hypertension was assessed only by decrease in echocardiographic measurement of estimated RV pressure, not by decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance. Lastly, there were 3 symptomatic ASD patients with small unclosed PDA. Although these PDAs were small, we cannot underestimate a significant contribution of PDA ligation to the observed improvement.",

Surgical ASD closure can be performed safely in symptomatic infants and young children with no significant incidence in perioperative morbidity and mortality. We suggest early closure of ASD, either by device or by surgery, in all symptomatic infants and young toddlers with underlying chronic lung disease to mitigate ongoing parenchymal and vascular injury to the lung while enhancing improvement of lung function.",
