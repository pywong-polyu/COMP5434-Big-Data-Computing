The pandemic is so fast that any concrete theory of sudden widespread of this disease is still not known. In this work, we studied and analyzed a large number of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the world using the multifractal approach. The mutation events in the isolates obey the Markov process and exhibit very high mutational rates, which occur in six specific genes and highest in orf1ab gene, leading to virulent nature. f (\u03b1) analysis indicated that the isolates are highly asymmetric (left-skewed), revealing the richness of complexity and dominance by large fluctuations in genome structure organization. The values of Hq and Dq are found to be significantly large, showing heterogeneous genome structure self-organization, strong positive correlation in organizing the isolates, and quite sensitive to fluctuations in and around it. We then present multiple-isolates hosts-virus interaction models, and derived Price equation for the model. The phase plane analysis of the model showed asymptotic stability type bifurcation. The competition among the mutant isolates drives the trade-off of the dominant mutant isolates, otherwise confined to the present hosts.",

Coronaviruses (CoVs) belongs to Coronaviridae subfamily (which have \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4-CoVs genera) in the family Coronaviridae of the Nidovirales order [4] . The Covid-19 causing virus SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member in \u03b2-CoV genus [5] , which can infect humans [6] , and it's genetic manipulation studies, and sequence analysis has led to the claim that it is not laboratory manipulated virus [6, 7] . It's genome is +ssRNS (single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus) [4, 5] having 30kb genome size [8] which becomes 100-160nm in compact form [4, 6, 7] . Further, it's genome has been found 80% similarity with that of SARS-CoV, whereas around 96% similarity with that of bat coronavirus [9] .",

However, SARS-CoV-2 enter and infect target host cells (lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels) through the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and ACE2 expression is found to be increased in diabetes (type 1 or type 2) [11] . Further, hypertension is treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs) [11] , resulting in an increase in ACE2 expression [12] . Hence, diabetes and hypertension patients might have a severe risk of developing Covid-19 as these patients use ACE inhibitors and ARBs as a drug which upregulate ACE2 expression [13] .

The initial growth rate of Covid-19 pandemic is dominated by Malthus growth rate [17] , and if we consider significant amount of time of the pandemic, coronavirus infected or death population nicely follow logistic [19] or more systematically Gompertz growth law [20] . The spread of every disease epidemic or pandemic generally increase monotonically (following Malthus law [17] ) due to availability of large susceptible population till it reach threshold value [22] (follow logistic or Gompertz law [19, 20] ). After reaching this threshold size of epidemic, it will gradually decrease the size of epidemic due to removal of all susceptible populations and gradual decrease of the virus virulence, die out slowly [22] . In such scenario, the Winsor growth model [21] is quite suitable to explain and forecast, because, the function H(t) in the solution of Winsor model in equation (1), N (t) = De \u2212e CH(t) , can have the change in sign, and can be expanded through Taylor series, [17, 23] . However, happening of this condition is unlikely, even though the dynamical process could lead to the sacrifice of a certain population of infected people N U (t), who is most probably unhealthy/non-immune population out of N (t), and the most fitted one N F (t) = N (t) \u2212 N U (t) will survive. But, the question of why the growth rates of both infected and death are different in different countries at the epidemic network level or genetic level and how to control the epidemic/pandemic size are still open questions.",

It is also found that this high mutation rate intensifies virulence and coevolution of the virus with the host [24] . Further, these mutations in them are accountable for viral genome replication [27] .

The calculated mean value of the mutation per gene of the virus with error bars given by first and third quartiles ( Fig. 2A) indicates that mutations take place at some specific genes only (mainly in orf1ab, S, ORF3a, M, ORF8, N genes). The results show that m r of orf 1ab and ORF 3a, such that m orf 1ab m ORF 3a , and these two genes could be key genes for enhancing virus virulence and transmission [24, 27] which may lead to a disease epidemic. Further, the mean values of mutation rates of all isolates in each country are calculated and found the overall mutation rates S. Korea, Sweden, Japan, and the USA are large in comparison. The confirmed Covid-19 positive case, as well as death rate in these countries, are found to be comparatively large in comparison with other countries (Fig. 1) , indicating an increase in mutation rate enhances the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 virus [24, 28] . Further, we calculated mutation rates of all six types of mutations N i \u2192 N i\u22121 , where, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, N i \u2208 [A, C, T, G] and, for the sake of simplicity, N i \u2192 N i\u22121 and N i\u22121 \u2192 N i are taken to be the same in the calculation (Fig. 3B) . The results show that the average mutation rates of these mutation types in each country are found to be random and follow the Markov process [29] . It is observed that the transition is more frequent than transversion. During the evolution of genomes, the transition is more frequently observed as compared to transversion as the former usually does not lead to altering the protein, but the later has a higher impact on the change in the protein structure and function [30] . Some isolates of Wuhan, China contains transversion indicating that there is rapid evolution leading to adaptation with the new environment for survival or possibly making these isolates more virulent compared to their counterpart. On the other hand, LR757995 out of a total of 15 isolates only consist of C \u2192 T mutation type at genomic location 8781. This specific mutation is seen to mutate along with mutation from T \u2192 C at genomic position 28143. These two mutations at positions 8781 and 28143 are highly prevalent in the USA (14 out of 16) and Japanese isolates (3 out of 4). Besides the isolates available from South Korea, Nepal, Sweden, one isolate from Taiwan and Australia does not contain these two specific mutations. It is probable that the genomic isolates spreading in the USA are less virulent compared to the reference Wuhan virus.",

In this technique, we first convert the symbolic genome sequence to time series like DNA walk by taking purine( A or G) as step-up (+1) and pyrimidine as step down (\u22121) [see the Methods]. DNA walk is a cumulative sum, which means that the effect of a single point mutation can lead to different walk altogether, and hence we can quantify them using Multifractal parameters [see the Methods]. Then multifractal analysis can be done from the DNA walk of each viral isolate to calculate various multifractal parameters. The DNA walks of all SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus isolates collected from the patients' data from various countries (42 isolates) as a function of order parameter q obey Markov process (Fig. 4A ). The calculated fluctuation function F q (s) of order q as a function of normalized s [s = int(S/L), L is the length of the DNA walk of the virus genome] for all SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates follow overall power-law behavior F q (s) \u223c s Hq , where, H q is the Hurst exponent of order q [34] (Fig. 4B ) indicating fractal nature in the virus genome organization. Further, the calculated H q as a function of q is found to be q and s dependent ( Fig. 4B and Fig. 5D ) indicating the scaling nature in F q (s) is inter-event dependent showing multifractal nature [32] . Since the F q behavior indicate local multiple fractal natures at various local domains of s with various local Hurst exponents, H [1] q , H [2] q , . . . , H [n] q , F q (s) exhibits self-affine multifractal property via observable variable z(s) [32, 33, 35] given by,",

The calculated change in H q with respect to reference virus genome H q \u2212 H C q 0 is positive (Fig. 5E ), the correlations in the virus genome increases in the mutated isolates which could be one reason for increase in virulence in virus isolates. The average value in H A q and variability are much more in Wuhan virus isolates as compared to other countries (Fig. 5F ). The multifractal analysis of the virus isolates across the countries reveals that mutated virus isolates have increased virulence as compared to the reference virus. Further, presence of multiple isolates in a host also enhances virulence of the virus. The virus isolate is quite sensitive to fluctuations and might correlated to increase in virus mutations which cause heterogeneity in genome structure exhibiting strong multifractal properties.",

Otherwise, the old viral isolates will stick to the old hosts (\u00b5 2 \u00b5 1 ,x * is a stable fixed point since \u03bb 0) without diffusing from the hosts. Further, the characteristics time scale, which is the time required to determine significant change inx around fixed pointx * , is given by, \u03c4 = 1 (7),",

Some of the most important factors of the origin of this virulence could be due to high mutational events in the virus genome when hosts-virus interaction takes place, and the presence of multiple virus isolates in the host. The Covid-19 pandemic is all of a sudden first epicenter from Wuhan, China, and spread all over the work, killing nearly two lakh people across the world. The pandemic is so fast, no concrete theory of the widespread of this disease, and still no vaccine is discovered yet. In this work, we studied and analyzed a large number of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from patients from different parts of the world to explore the possibility of the origin of this pandemic. Our study of mutational profiles of SARS-CoV-2 isolates across the world show very high mutational rates in these isolates, which led the isolates more virulent, causing significant harm to the hosts and enhance viral transmission to hosts. The mutations in these isolates also take place mainly in six specific genes out of eleven genes, and the highest mutation takes place in the orf1ab gene and the mutation events follow the Markov process. It is also found from the mutational profile study that transition is much more frequent than transversion.",

The calculated multifractal parameters reveal that structural variability in the isolates is caused by the presence of multiple isolates in the hosts. These isolates are highly asymmetric (left-skewed) in the singularity function, indicating the richness of complexity and dominance by large fluctuations in genome structure organization imparting virulence in the virus. The large values obtained for Hurst exponent and generalized dimension indicates heterogeneous genome structure organization and strong positive correlation in the organization of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The genome structures of the isolates are far from equilibrium, self-organized, and quite sensitive to fluctuations in and around it. This could also be the origin of multiple isolates in a certain geographical area. The presence of multiple isolates in hosts may lead the Covid-19 pandemic.",
