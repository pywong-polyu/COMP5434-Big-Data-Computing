However, few researchers have incorporated this kind of waning effect into their virus spread models. In this study, we simulate an influenza epidemic that considers the effects of waning immunity by fitting epidemiological models to CDC secondary historical data aggregated on a weekly basis, and derive the transmission rates at which susceptible individuals become infected over the course of the influenza season. Using a system of differential equations, we define four groups of individuals in a population: susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered. We show that a larger number of initially infected individuals might not only bring the influenza season to an end sooner but also reduce the epidemic size. Moreover, any influenza virus that entails a faster recovery rate does not necessarily lead to a smaller epidemic size. We illustrate how simulation helps in understanding the effects of influenza epidemiological model in the presence of waning influenza vaccine immunity.",

In the 2017 to 2018 influenza season, there were as many as 50 viruses identified for vaccine productions. [3] Given the selected viruses for the new formulation, vaccine manufacturers are racing against time as they produce, test, and distribute the vaccine under a tight schedule. [3] [4] [5] Unfortunately, antigenically variable pathogens, such as influenza viruses, are living organisms and are capable of continuously altering the proteins or carbohydrates on their surface and mutating to different strains, thereby potentially escaping from the immunity induced by vaccination. [6] Many studies have reported that vaccine effectiveness within a single influenza season can decrease over time. Kissling et al [7] stated that the decreasing influenza vaccine effectiveness could be the result of virus changes through the season or waning immunity. Pebody et al [8] and Belongia et al [9] advocated the need for developing influenza vaccines that provide better and longerlasting protection in view of the occurrence of late past-season outbreaks. Hill et al [10] developed a multi-strain transmission model to predict the chronological interactions between the influenza viruses and waning immunity among the population.",

Methodologically, we employ simulation, which has been one common approach for understanding the course of an influenza epidemic both in practice and in the literature. [11, 12] Goeyvaerts et al [13] developed a seasonal influenza transmission model for evaluating the impact of vaccination on the incidence of infection, disease, and mortality. The authors proposed to directly estimate the values of the seasonal influenza model parameters by fitting the model to influenza data over multiple influenza seasons. To empirically ground the model, we follow the literature and present a simplified, yet accurate way of fitting influenza seasonal transmission models to publicly available data. [13, 14] Using a system of differential equations, we simulate the dynamics of the infection in the population compartmentalized into several groups. The differential equations allow us to define the rates at which susceptible individuals become infectious or infected individuals recover from the disease. Lastly, we conduct an extensive sensitivity analysis to validate our model by varying a wide range of common experimental parameters discussed in the extant literature. This study visualizes the progress of the influenza epidemic not only when vaccine effectiveness wanes, but also when some seemingly favorable change of conditions counter-intuitively contributes to a worsening of the spread of influenza.",

Hence, the influenza strain increasingly differs from its progenitor so that the vaccine-induced immunity against the progenitor can diminish over time.

To focus on modeling the probability of individuals being infected given their demographic or community information, agent-based models are capable of considering the stochastic nature of the transmission rate between individuals.

Prior to the 2015 to 2016 influenza season, the weekly influenza update from public health and clinical laboratories were not separately reported. Compared to the clinical laboratories, public health laboratories often receive samples that have already tested positive for an influenza virus at a clinical laboratory. [3] Relatively speaking, the data from clinical laboratories are less distorted than those from public health laboratories in terms of truthfully representing the situations in the population. Therefore, we chose to use data from four influenza seasons, starting with the 2015 to 2016 season, to inform the estimates for our epidemiological model. Figure 2 displays the time-series data of four (over-imposed) influenza seasons consisting of 208 (52 \u00c2 4) weekly fractions of the positive laboratory specimens test results. Overall, the percentages rise rather quickly at the beginning of the season before declining to some low levels starting with week 24.

For the given empirical data set, we fit the sinusoidal function (1), using the model specified in (2) Next, we derive the estimated contact rate function at which a susceptible individual becomes infected when contacting an infectious individual. Intuitively, the contact rate determines the instantaneous rate of change to the weekly positivity rate. We propose a novel approach for finding the contact rate by borrowing a fundamental concept from Physics: the contact rate is to the weekly positivity rate as the acceleration is to velocity. That is, if we view the positivity rate in a week as velocity, then the contact rate should be the instantaneous rate of acceleration in the given week. Thus, we take the first derivative of the sine function f(t) with respect to t to find the contact rate as a cosine function:",

According to CDC, [3] infected people can be contagious one day before experiencing symptoms, which typically last 3 to 7 days, and can stay contagious for up to 7 days after becoming sick. The contagious period can be longer than 7 days for children and some people with weakened immune systems. Cori et al [28] pointed out that it is impossible to directly observe the duration of the infectious period. The authors reviewed the literature and found that the 95% probability intervals of the mean duration of the infectious period can be any number of days up to 12 days, while the majority of cases having an infectious period are shorter than 2.9 days. Thus, we consider g, the recovery rate of infected individuals, to vary between 1 12 and 1 2 . Since it is of interest, we also tracked and observed during our simulations the total number of recovered individuals, as a proxy for the size of the epidemic. Another uncertainty that we bring into the study is the proportion of people who gain immunity, at least in the beginning of the season. Statistics from the 2018 influenza season showed that, depending on age group, the percentage of people who received an influenza vaccination varies between 30% and 70%, with vaccine effectiveness ranging from 10% to 60%. [29, 30] Thus, we let a, the proportion of susceptible individuals fully protected by the vaccine, vary between 3% and 42%. Moreover, we vary I 0 , the initial number of infected individuals, between 1 and 100. Lastly, Grohskopf et al [31] pointed out that the observed waning effect might not consistently manifest itself across all age groups, virus subtypes, or seasons. Nonetheless, Ferdinands et al [32] examined the association between influenza vaccine effectiveness and time since vaccination among patients in the United States. The authors found significant evidence that influenza vaccine protection could decline by 6% to 11% per month since the time of vaccination, depending on influenza type. Thus, we vary z, the rate at which the number of (newly) vaccinated individuals decreases over time, from 6% to 11%.",

            "text": "We code the system of differential Eqs. (3) to (6) in MATLAB and solve them numerically for the values of a given t under different scenarios (solver ode45; www.mathworks.com). When computing, we begin by assigning the initial values of the groups of the population, with N and R 0 being always held constant at 10 6 and at 0, respectively. In addition, every influenza season spans 52 weeks, starting at week 40 of 1 year and ending at week 39 of the following year. During the season, individuals continuously interact with each other, and the size of the four groups changes at the rates defined by the differential equations. Figure 4 shows the impact of the recovery rate on the number of individuals in the four groups over the course of the influenza season. We observe that an influenza virus that requires a longer recovery time tends to cause the population to experience another uptick in the number of infected individuals at around week 36. We also note that the longer the time the infected individuals take to recover, the larger the epidemic size is-that is, the total number of recovered individuals at the end of the season. Figure 5 shows that if the population has a larger number of initially infected individuals (I), then the peak of the season would not only arrive sooner but also be smaller. A subtle and counterintuitive observation is that the epidemic size-that is, the total number of recovered individuals at the end of the season-is actually smaller when I is larger. We will examine this phenomenon in more detail shortly. Figure 6 shows the impact of the proportion of the vaccinated population on the number of individuals in the four groups over the course of the influenza season. The greater the proportion of individuals receiving the vaccination at the beginning of the season, the smaller the epidemic size (the total number of 40 52 12 24 36 Week of the year Chen and Stanciu Medicine (2021) 100: 36 Medicine recovered individuals) at the end of the season. An increase in a seems to lead to a decrease in the size of the epidemic, but it also delays the peak of the season, as well as leading to an uptick in infected individuals toward the end of the season. Figure 7 highlights the missing link in the literature-the effect of the individuals leaking from V to S when the vaccination is subject to the waning effect. Even with a slight increase in the waning effect, for example, z from 0 to 6% (i.e., top-left panel to top-right panel), the size of the epidemic could increase by more than 100%. Therefore, researchers studying related topics should not disregard the waning effect. Although a higher waning rate leads to a larger epidemic size, the peak of the season takes place roughly in the same week. The implication is that researchers or practitioners may not be able to tell if the effectiveness of a given vaccine can wane over time by observing the timing of the peak of the season. Figure 8 shows the epidemic size given four different values for the number of initially infected individuals. Counter-intuitively, relatively faster recovery rates, roughly between 1/12 and 1/7, can actually make the epidemic worse. Another interesting observa-tion is that, for the cases where the recovery rate is greater than about 15%, the greater the number of initially infected individuals, the smaller the epidemic (i.e., the smaller the total number of recovered individuals at the end of the season). Note that for influenza that entails a recovery period of 7 days or fewer, a greater number of initially infected individuals can lead to a decrease in the season's epidemic size. But for influenza that entails a recovery period of 7 days or more, a greater number of initially infected individuals can lead to an increase in the season's epidemic size. Figure 9 illustrates that the higher the waning rate, the larger the epidemic size. The implication is that the effectiveness of the vaccine must be made as good as possible to effectively mitigate the potential outbreak of an epidemic. Similar to the phenomenon observed in Figure 8 , a faster recovery rate might increase the epidemic size, and the phenomenon holds even under different rates of the waning effect.",

The 40 52 12 24 36 Week of the year Chen and Stanciu Medicine (2021) 100: 36 Medicine practical implication of the study lies in simulating the size of the influenza epidemic when varying several model parameters. In particular, we show how an uptick in influenza cases toward the end of the season or even a delay in the peak of the season might be caused by scenarios involving an influenza virus that entails a longer recovery time, or when a greater portion of the population gets vaccinated. The rather counter-intuitive results suggest that a larger number of initially infected individuals might not only bring the influenza season to an end sooner but also reduce the size of the epidemic. Moreover, an influenza virus that entails a faster recovery rate does not necessarily lead to a smaller epidemic size.",

According to CDC, [3] both type A and type B influenza viruses are responsible for causing seasonal epidemics of the disease every winter. [10] It has been reported that different types of the influenza virus could show up at different times in an influenza season. [33] Thus, the implications of the waning effect over time we discussed in this study may pan out differently for different types of the influenza virus. Another direction for future research is to consider the group of immunosuppressed individuals in the model. [34] Individuals with immune dysfunction may not respond to the vaccine as well as people without immune dysfunction. [35] Furthermore, people who are severely immunocompromised (e.g., HIV-infected people, organ transplant recipients, or people who undergo immunosuppressive treatments) tend to prolong influenza virus shedding, increase morbidity or mortality following infection, and be reinfected with the same virus strain. [36, 37] Thus, researchers can study the impact of immunosuppression on the SVIR model. Finally, researchers may consider applying the framework of this study and analyze influenza data from other countries or regions, for additional insights.",
