            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a high-mortality disease and lacks effective pharmacotherapy. A traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, Ning Fei Ping Xue (NFPX) decoction, was demonstrated to play a critical role in alleviating inflammatory responses of the lung. However, its therapeutic effectiveness in ARDS and active compounds, targets, and molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The present study investigates the effects of NFPX decoction on ARDS mice induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The results revealed that NFPX alleviated lung edema evaluated by lung ultrasound, decreased lung wet/Dry ratio, the total cell numbers of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels in BALF and serum, and ameliorated lung pathology in a dosedependent manner. Subsequently, UPLC-HRMS was performed to establish the compounds of NFPX. A total of 150 compounds in NFPX were characterized. Moreover, integrating network pharmacology approach and transcriptional profiling of lung tissues were performed to predict the underlying mechanism. 37 active components and 77 targets were screened out, and a herbs-compounds-targets network was constructed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from LPS-treated mice compared with LPS combined with NFPX mice. GO, KEGG, and artificial intelligence analysis indicated that NFPX might act on various drug targets. At last, potential targets, HRAS, SMAD4, and AMPK, were validated by qRT-PCR in ARDS murine model. In conclusion, we prove the efficacy of NFPX decoction in the treatment of ARDS. Furthermore, integrating network pharmacology, transcriptome, and artificial intelligence analysis contributes to illustrating the molecular mechanism of NFPX decoction on ARDS.",

One study has shown that hydroxysafflor yellow A alleviates LPS-induced ARDS in mice by blocking TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 2017) . In a rat model, silymarin can attenuate LPS-induced lung injury by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway (Zhu and Sun, 2018) . Chen et al. have found that honokiol could protect the pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier from damage by LPS in ARDS models by promoting the SIRT3/AMPK signaling pathway and suppressing Ang-2 expression . It was also reported that celastrol might reduce ARDS-related lung injury caused by LPS in rats by inactivating NF-\u03baB signaling pathways (Wei and Wang, 2017) . Although there are a lot of achievements achieved from the studies of TCM in ARDS, the detailed molecular mechanisms of TCM are rarely known due to the complexity and diversity of TCM ingredients and the synergistic or antagonistic effects among the ingredients. Different from the pattern of \"one target, one drug\" in modern medicine, TCM theory emphasizes a holistic view of the human body. Conventional experimental pharmacological techniques may not be applicable to the research field of TCM on account of the complexity of its components, targets, and mechanisms, posing challenges for the development of TCM.",

Network pharmacology is a sophisticated tool system that deciphers the mechanisms of complex herb formulas from the component level to gene level based on multiple large databases (Boezio et al., 2017) . One of the most important characteristics of TCM is \"holistic philosophy,\" which coincides with systemic analysis of \"network pharmacology.\" As an advanced research method, the network pharmacology of TCM transforms the research paradigm from \"one target, one drug\" into the novel \"network target, multi-components.\" This helps assess the compatibility and cooperativity of TCM and elaborate the relationships of targets and signaling pathways in the network (Chen et al., 2016 [Lauraceae; Cinnamomi cortex, 7 g], and Pheretima, 7 g. NFPX decoction has been found to mitigate the inflammatory response of acute and chronic respiratory diseases in clinical practice. Improved oxygen saturation, increased number of ventilator-free days, and shortened ICU and hospital lengths of stay were observed in patients with respiratory failure after the administration of NFPX decoction. However, its efficacy in ARDS and specific molecule target and mechanism still need to be investigated. In the present study, we have first investigated the effects of NFPX decoction on ameliorating lung edema and inflammatory response of ARDS mice induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Additionally, we have explored the mechanisms by screening specific molecular targets using network pharmacology, transcriptome analysis, and artificial intelligence analysis to provide the theoretical basis for the clinical application of NFPX decoction on ARDS patients. The detailed schematic of the workflow in the current study is shown in Figure 1 .",

NFPX granules were kindly provided by Prof. Jianxin Chen (Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China), which were extracted by ethanol (Bu et al., 2020) . The extraction procedures are as follows: water and ground NFPX material were placed in a Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 731377 glass tube (12:1); the solution was kept boiling for 1 h; then, water (8:1) was added for second water extraction step. The water supernatant was filtered and dried using a rotary evaporator under vacuum followed by freeze-drying to obtain the water extract. 55% ethanol was added to water extract in the glass tube, and the mixture was sonicated for 1 h. The ethanol extract was filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m syringe filter; then, the extract was made into granules. Mice were anesthetized with gaseous isoflurane, followed by instillation of 40 \u03bcl LPS (Escherichia coli 055: B5, L8880; Solarbio, Beijing, China) into the tracheas using 22G needles to establish ARDS model or 40 \u03bcl PBS as control. For NFPX pretreatment, various doses of NFPX granules dissolved in water were administered intragastrically daily for 7 consecutive days before LPS administration. On day 8, the animals were anesthetized with gaseous isoflurane; retroorbital venous blood, BALF, and lung tissues were collected for the subsequent analysis.",

In contrast, lung ultrasonograms of ARDS usually show B-lines and pleural thickening and ground-glass areas (Picano et al., 2006) . B-lines are defined as comet tail-like hyperechoic reverberation artifacts arising from and perpendicular to the pleural line, which is representative of thickened interlobular septa. To elucidate the imaging characteristics of different disposing groups, we performed lung ultrasound after 24 h treatment of LPS. As shown in Figure 2A , lung tissues in healthy mice showed A-lines (white arrow) and uniformly continuous pleural line (black arrow). In contrast, multiple well-defined B-lines and thickened pleural and ground-glass areas can be seen in the LPS-induced mouse model ( Figure 2B ). As anticipated, NFPX lightened the ultrasound abnormalities caused by LPS. It can be observed that fewer B-lines and ground-glass areas exist in LPS+2.6 g/kg NFPX or LPS+5.2 g/kg NFPX group (Figures 2C,D) than those in the LPS treatment group. What is more, a high concentration of NFPX treatment with or without LPS appears the same as that in the ultrasound images of normal mice ( Figures 2E,F) . These data reasonably suggested that NFPX may relieve the alveolar interstitial edema and thickened interlobular septa.",

            "text": "The previous data provide intuitive evidence for NFPX exerting protective effects against ARDS. We further validated the protective effects of NFPX during experimental ARDS. HE staining was performed to assess the pathological changes of the lung. As shown in Figures 3A,B , alveolar edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, atelectasis, and inflammatory cells infiltration were the most severe in the LPS group and had the highest lung injury score correspondingly. NFPX treatment effectively alleviated these LPS-induced pathological changes in a dose-dependent manner. Compared to na\u00efve mice, NFPX alone treatment did not exhibit significant pathological changes in tissues. Besides, several indicators associated with lung microvascular permeability and extravascular lung water were quantified, including lung wet/dry weight ratio and cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). As expected, administration with NFPX prominently reduced the lung wet/ dry weight ratio and cell number in BALF induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05, Figures 3C,D) . These results sufficiently supported that NFPX remarkably abrogated LPSinduced pathological changes without exerting side effects. Next, we further explore how the NFPX plays a role in deterring the development of ARDS induced by LPS. Cell apoptosis and inflammation reaction are the core pathophysiologic mechanisms of ARDS. The proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, contribute to the infiltration of inflammatory cells during ARDS development. In accordance with the above data, NFPX also hampers the cell apoptosis and the level of cytokines in the lung during ARDS in a concentrationdependent manner ( Figures 3E-I) . Considering the characterization of ARDS as the systemic inflammatory reaction, the levels of three cytokines in peripheral serum were also examined. Results have shown that NFPX reduced the secretion of cytokines in serum, although the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 are lower than those in BALF ( Figures 3J-L) .",

Then, these targets were docked by the NFPX ingredients with a three-dimensional structure on the representative conformations using the SYBYL \u2212 Surflex docking in standard precision mode. The docking results were ranked based on the CScore ranking (Supplementary Table S9 ). We observed many compound-target interactions with high docking scores. For example, with the docking score of 5 as the threshold, we can find that 63, 1, 105, 87, 84, 78, 99, and 17 ingredients interact with AKT2, AMPK, HARS, HIF-1, P35, RAC1, SMAD4, and SOD1, respectively. More specifically, with the docking score ranking, some potential active components of NFPX can be screened from these compounds. For example, the compound astragaloside IV interacts with SMAD4, P35, HIF-1, AKT2, RAC1, HARS, AMPK, and SOD1 with a docking score of 11.56, 10.86, 10.6, 9.75, 9.15, 8.94, 5.57, and 5.05, respectively, indicating that astragaloside IV may function by a multi-target mode.

In the previous literature, almost all studies about ARDS treatment by TCM have focused on the single component or bioactive molecules extracted from TCM Long et al., 2020) . The appearance of network pharmacology analysis and high throughput sequencing break the barriers and greatly promote the development of TCM theory. Here, we demonstrated that NFPX can block the occurrence and development of ARDS for the first time. NFPX can alleviate lung impairment and prevent airway mucus overproduction via inhibiting cell apoptosis and inflammation, which coincide with the current treatment strategies of ARDS that modify the inflammatory process or promote the re-establishment of functional lung tissue. Furthermore, we explored the potential molecular mechanisms of NFPX against the ARDS by integrating network pharmacology, transcriptome analysis, and artificial intelligence analysis.",

            "text": "ARDS is a group of clinical disorders characterized by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Lung ultrasound examination has been widely used to evaluate pulmonary edema in intensive care units due to several advantages, including high sensitivity, bedside examination, no radiation, and real-time assessment. Nevertheless, it has been rarely reported that lung ultrasound was applied in the ARDS mice model because of their small size (Rubin et al., 2016) . Here, an ultrahigh-frequency transducer probe was adopted to obtain high-resolution images. Our data gave preliminary evidences that NFPX relieved the alveolar interstitial syndrome and pleural thickening. Given the spatial heterogeneity of lung lesions in ARDS, both normal and abnormal artifacts can be observed in the same image. How to compare the scope, extent, types of lung lesions remains problematic. Therefore, further studies are needed for quantitative analysis of lung injury. It is widely believed that inflammation response and oxidative stress are the most prominent initial causes of ARDS. We not only illustrated the therapeutic effect of NFPX in ARDS from the macroperspective by lung ultrasound but also investigated the influence of NFPX on pathomorphological changes, apoptosis, release of cytokines from local lung tissues, and blood circulation in the ARDS mouse model. The LPS intratracheal instillation mouse model is a reliable and reproducible mouse model of ARDS (Quijada et al., 2020) . It has been widely used for fundamental research due to its similar pathophysiology to human ARDS. In our study, we observed that the degree of lung injury, lung W/D weight ratio, inflammatory cells infiltration, cell apoptosis, and cytokines release induced by LPS were significantly improved under the intervention of NFPX, and these effects manifested an apparent dosedependent manner. Besides, apparent side effects were not observed in mice after 1 wk of HNFPX administration. Reportedly, as the main components of NFPX, Carthami Clos and Scutellariae Radix play an essential role in treating LPSinduced ARDS (Zhang et al., 2017; Long et al., 2020; Davis et al., 2021) .",

In this study, we integrated the data based on network pharmacology, transcriptome, and artificial intelligence analysis. Bioactive components were identified meeting the criteria of OB \u2265 30% and DL index \u22650.18, which were regarded as pharmacokinetically active. Moreover, the herbs-compounds-targets network indicated that 77 target genes were closely associated with 37 bioactive components of NFPX. GO analysis indicated that NFPX may regulate inflammatory action via identical protein binding, nuclear receptor activity, and enzyme binding in extracellular space, extracellular region, and cell surface to exert its FIGURE 10 | Hierarchical clustering analysis of genes that were differentially expressed in lung tissue samples using heatmap; each group contains four to five individuals. Blue-white indicates lower expression, and red indicates high expression. Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 731377 18 therapeutic effects on ARDS. A study by John et al. has confirmed that the extracellular location and cell surface of essential genes are quite significant (Kuchtey and Kuchtey, 2014) . Besides, considering that most of the essential genes contribute to protein binding, nuclear receptor activity, and enzyme binding, it is quite reasonable to predict that the potential mechanisms of NFPX may involve multiple biological processes and molecular functions. Furthermore, KEGG enrichment shows that the principal signaling pathways participated in the process of treating ARDS by NFPX, including HIF-1 signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, and FOXO signaling pathway. Numerous researches have proved that HIF-1, as a promoter of inflammation storm, could aggravate the inflammation and lung injury of ARDS (Suresh et al., 2019; Jahani et al., 2020; Serebrovska et al., 2020) . Advanced glycation end products (AGE) could activate its receptor RAGE and promote oxidative stress leading to cell damage and inflammation . The roles of the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway are involved in lung diseases such as ARDS, lung cancer, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and have been demonstrated in previous reports (Machahua et al., 2016; Ahmad et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2021) . Besides, Sandeep et al. have announced that Forkhead box-O (FOXO) is essential in the exudative phase of ARDS (Artham et al., 2019) . In sum, the data of network pharmacology provide preliminary insights into the action mechanism of NFPX against ARDS. In addition, we explored the underlying mechanism via transcriptome analysis. Consistent with the phenomena that NFPX mitigates lung edema, cell apoptosis, and inflammatory reaction induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner, the gene clusters profile shown in the heatmap also manifested the same trend. Unexpectedly, only one upregulated gene and two downregulated genes in the LPS vs. LPS+MNFPX group were screened probably due to sequencing error affecting the data reliability of the LPS+MNFPX group in the following analysis. Despite that, the GO and KEGG enrichment pathway analysis in the LPS vs. LPS+LNFPX group and LPS+HNFPX group revealed that pathways associated with immune-inflammation response were the core regulation mechanism, which was in accordance with the previous data. What is more, SMAD4, HIF-1, and AMPK were screened by comprehensive analysis of network pharmacology, transcriptomics, and artificial intelligence. SMAD4, a member of the SMAD family of signal transduction proteins, is expressed in alveolar epithelial cells and has an inhibitory effect on tumors by reducing angiogenesis and increasing blood vessel hyperpermeability. However, Zhang and his colleagues have found that ARDS-associated pulmonary fibrosis might ameliorate through the SMAD4 signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 2015) . It is well known that hypoxia is a key feature of ARDS accompanied by multiple important cellular processes, including cell apoptosis, inflammatory response, and angiogenesis regulated by HIF-1. Data from previous studies have confirmed the important effects of HIF-1 in ARDS (Harris et al., 2019; Suresh et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020) . Ample amounts of evidence support the idea that the AMPK pathway exerts its effects in LPS-induced ARDS (Wang et al., 2016; Bone et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018) . Therefore, the above evidence suggested that NFPX can effectively treat ARDS by regulating the gene expression level of SMAD4, HIF-1, and AMPK to interfere with the immune-inflammation response. Moreover, further validation experiments are required in the future.",
