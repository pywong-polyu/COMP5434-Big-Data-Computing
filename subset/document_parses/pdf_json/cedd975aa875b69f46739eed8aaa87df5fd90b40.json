Most of the countries in the world have limited number of medical resources (hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc.), and in the case of large outbreak, it becomes very difficult to provide treatment to every infected individual. In this study, we propound a mathematical model where we classify the infected into two subcategoriesasymptomatic and symptomatic. This model further accounts for the effect of limited medical resource for infected people and using face masks in combating the pandemic. Focusing on these aspects, we analyze the model and exploit the available data for assessing the pattern in three most affected countries, namely USA, India and Brazil. The developed model is calibrated to fit data for these three countries and estimate the transmission rate of symptomatic, asymptomatic individuals. The rate at which the individuals who are quarantined recover is estimated as well. Along with these estimations, a comparative study based on the basic reproduction number estimated for the three countries is presented. Standard methods of sensitivity analysis are performed to analyze the ways in which basic reproduction number is impacted upon due to changes in different parameters of the model. Further, we obtain disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium of the model. It is observed that backward bifurcation occurs if the capacity of treatment is small and bistable equilibria are shown that makes the system more sensitive to the initial conditions. Sufficient conditions for the local asymptomatic stability of the endemic equilibrium and disease-free equilibrium of the system are obtained. The results of this study imply that to curb the severity of the increasing cases of the disease in these countries, effective strategies to control disease spread should be implemented so that the basic reproduction number can be decreased below the threshold value which is certainly less than unity. The use of protective masks in public is shown to be an important preventive measure to lower disease transmission rate. Also, the quantity of medical resources should increase so that every infected person can get better treatment. a",

The uncontrollable spread of the disease across 216 countries has threatened the world affecting the entire economy of the world due to lockdown. Industry, business, travel, etc. were closed during lockdown period. World is still suffering with this disease and definitely it is harmful for our economy [3] . As people are eagerly waiting through the lockdown for the development of an effective vaccine without much side effects, it is highly desirable to forecast the spread of COVID-19 to enable the policy maker to design suitable control strategies to combat with this disease, [4] . Here, Fig.  1 shows the global scenario of COVID-19 spread. From this figure, it is easy to visualize how COVID-19 has captured the whole world. The number of confirmed cases is still increasing, so in the absence of vaccine taking the protective measures is the only option to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. The currently available control measures to combat COVID-19 include nation lockdown, social distancing, enhanced sanitation, frequent hand wash, disinfection of surfaces, better ventilation, face mask and visor protection, along with proper diagnostics, followed by effective contact tracing and quarantining of the infected and exposed population section. One of the very simple, yet most effective control measure includes compulsory use of face masks which serves as a protective covering for the nasal area, to intervene the transmission of the disease-causing pathogens. For prevention of loss of considerable number of lives, usage of face mask is much needed intervention, as it an inexpensive tool to reduce the risk associated with rising death rates among the doctors, nurses and other front line workers around the world [5] [6] [7] .",

            "text": "Mathematical modeling is one of the widely used approach for conducting a research on the fundamental dynamics of a disease spread and suggesting various control strategies when sufficient disease-related information is not available. In [8] , Stutt et al. showed that use of face mask by the people in public could contribute highly in reducing the impact of COVID-19. Sincere and compulsory face mask usage, optimum use of respirators and eye protection in health care and public places were suggested from the study of Chu et al. [9] . The study in [10] demonstrated that if the surgical face masks with 70% plus efficacy are used by minimum of 70% of the New York public consistently, then it could result in pandemic elimination in the same. The finding of Eikenberry et al. [11] emphasized that use of moderately ineffective face masks broadly may help in reduction of community transmission of the deadly disease as well decrease rising hospitalization cases and deaths. The authors in [12] showed that COVID-19 could be controlled effectively by implementing measures on physical distancing provided its effectiveness level is somewhat moderate. Though use of face mask is an efficient tool to help overcome this pandemic in certain way, like its usage in public led to significant reduction in COVID-19 cases in Nigeria, but use of it as the only intervention will not help in realistic disease elimination. The elimination of disease demands unrealistic high compliance in the usage of face masks in open spaces, ranging between 80% and 95%. If a minimum of 55 percentage of the population adhere to regulation on social distancing and compulsorily wear masks while in open social places, the infection will one day die out [13] . In addition, enhancing the rate of detection of the cases for symptomatic people to about 0.8 per day leads to a greater reduction in the prevalence of the disease. There are other research papers where researchers have computed the basic reproduction number R 0 for the region under consideration and they have also estimated important parameters from the available set of data of COVID-19 [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

            "text": "Limited resource is another concern when it comes to combating the rising COVID-19 cases. Non-availability of sufficient number of hospital beds and ventilators has proved to be challenge in both developing and developed nations. In [18] , shortage of important equipment, which includes PPE kits for the hospital staff, ventilators for critically sick individuals and hospital beds for other patients is reported. As per [19] , the estimated number of ventilators which will be required to accommodate rising number of patients would range between several thousands to half a million. A recent study in [20] suggested that the States would need several more surgical masks and respirators for fighting the deadly virus. The situation is no better in Brazil with the rising cases in the country and lack of medical equipment. The report from [21] states that less than 10 ventilators are available for around one-third of the cities in Brazil. Due to the countries social inequality, around 80 percentage of the entire population depends on public health system which makes the situation even worse. As per [22] , in the southeast region, 21 beds per 1,00,000 people are available and the northern region accounts much lesser to 9 beds. In [23] , the authors studied the modeling of COVID-19 using the complex network approach and presented that the demand for ICU beds might increase 3 times the country's capacity if the growth of the epidemic keeps increasing in steep manner. In India, though the number of deaths has been less compared to those in the USA and Brazil, it did face shortage of bed and ventilators supply. As per [24], before the pandemic hit India, it had mere 1 bed per 2000 people. Few major cities of India, namely Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune and Delhi have suffered due to shortage in supplies of beds and ventilators. According to [25], a detailed report on bed availability in government hospitals is listed with estimations as per the variations in the number of infected cases. Mathematical models help in understanding the disease trend and provide important conclusions. In [26] , the authors have presented two models, one on rapid growth phase of the pandemic and another model focussed on the complete data set. They concluded that the new cases are proportional to the total cases in power-law relation with a certain exponent value. The second model provided a duplication time which helps interpret new cases as well as total cases. In [27] , the authors used Monte Carlo Simulation for prediction of time evolution of the pandemic in Italy. They used different functions like Gaussian, Lognormal, Planck law function and others to fit the ratio of new daily cases per swab. A similar approach along with Gauss error function is used in [28] .The authors in [29] have presented an optimal control analysis by considering preventive and management measures as two control variables, and further determined the most cost-effective control measure. A single ordinary integro-differential equation is used in [30] , and its similarities with classic epidemic models are laid out along with its plus over other models. They applied their model to more than 15 countries with major attention in Germany and Italy. Levenberg-Marquardt Artificial Neural Network is used to design intelligent computer paradigm for solving a nonlinear system of equation of the COVID-19 model in [31] . The authors also used numerical method namely Runge-Kutta method for numerically solving the model. In [32] and [33] , authors did a study based on disease outbreak during lockdown in Italy and attainment of herd immunity in India, respectively. In the former work, the authors fitted both daily new cases as well as a total of the diseased and recovered cases.",

This model further emphasizes on the impact of treatment and use of face mask on the disease transmission dynamics in three most affected countries (USA, India and Brazil). We study the effectiveness of face mask in flattening of the disease progression curve. The main aim is to provide a figure on what percentage of face masks can control the spread of coronavirus and whether wearing of face masks can eliminate the burden of COVID-19, also we try to see the effect of treatment of symptomatic infected individuals. Here, we assume that treatment is not available to all infected individuals when a certain threshold of number of infected is crossed. The flow of remaining part of the paper is as follows: in second section formulation of the model and basic assumptions are presented. The next section involves disease-free, endemic equilibria and demonstration of the backward bifurcation of the system. Next generation matrix method is used to obtain analytical expression for the basic reproduction number in Section 3. Section 4 deals with the data representation and model calibration. The model is calibrated using daily disease cases of the three most affected countries of world, which are USA, Brazil and India. This section also deals with estimation of key parameters and data fitting to the proposed model. Here, sensitivity analysis is also performed to understand the impact of parameters on the basic reproduction number R 0 . Final section includes a detailed explanation of the results obtained in the form of discussion and conclusion.",

The susceptible population get exposed to the infection and move to the exposed class on effective contacts with asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious human population at the rates \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 , respectively. 3. p m is the fraction of population wearing facemasks in correct and consistent way in social places. Let \u03c3 m be the efficacy of the facemasks. From [12] , it is concluded that effective and consistent use of face masks help reduce transmission of disease. So, the above effective disease transmission rates \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 modify to \u03b2 1 (1\u2212\u03c3 m p m ) and \u03b2 2 (1\u2212\u03c3 m p m ), respectively. 4. A section of exposed individuals do not show any sort of clinical symptoms and move to asymptomatic class, while the rest join the symptomatic class, those who develop the symptoms of COVID-19. 5. We have seen that most of asymptomatic infected people are in home quarantine or institute quarantine for some days, if any quarantine individual develops the symptoms, he/she moves to symptomatic class with rate \u03b3 a , and if he/she do not have any symptoms for a specified period then he/she can join recover class with rate of \u03b7 a . Few asymptomatic infected individuals show certain clinical symptoms with time and hence move to symptomatic compartment at the rate \u03b1. 6. Now the number of COVID-19 cases is very high so in some countries the resources (no. of beds in hospitals, no. of ventilators) are not sufficient to cater every infected individual. This problem is not only in developing country (low-income country) but also in developed country like USA, etc. [18, 19, 35] . So in our proposed model, we have included this fact of limited resources [36, 37] .",

The existence of two values of E * suggests that there is a probability of backward bifurcation and this is exhibited in Fig. 3a . The diagram on bifurcation is obtained by taking into consideration \u03b2 2 , which is the transmission coefficient as the critical parameter and plotting it against the corresponding values of R 0 . The obtained plot suffices that mere reduction of the reproduction number R 0 below one is not enough for elimination of the disease, since the existence of backward bifurcation demands reduction in value of R 0 quite lesser than one to obtain stability of the unique infection-free equilibrium. In this case, we have two endemic equilibrium is named as E 2 and E 3 . In Fig. 3b , the diagram on bifurcation is obtained by considering the threshold value of the infective population I 0 as the critical parameter. In this case, it is observed that this parameter has involvement in Eur. Phys. J. Plus (2021) 136:359 the treatment. This is due to the assumption that treatment is proportional to the number of infective until the infective population reaches a threshold value I 0 , after which the treatment function becomes a constant. As a result, in this figure it is noted that the equilibrium level of the infective population decreases with the rise in I 0 until it comes to a saturation point. The situation when the reproduction number R 0 < 1 and either the infection free equilibrium E 0 is stable or the equilibrium E 3 is stable is described in Fig. 3b . In this situation when we increase I 0 , the equilibrium level of the exposed population (corresponding to the equilibrium E 2 ) decreases up until we arrive at I 0 = 43.457 where increasing it further has no effect and in this situation only the infection free equilibrium E 0 is stable. Theorem 3.1 When R 0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium E 0 = (S 0 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is locally asymptotically stable under some restriction on the parameters otherwise it is unstable.",

These three countries are the most affected countries in world due to current COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 active cases were collected from [39] . In Table 1 , we listed the key parameters of the model (1) that are estimated from the data and other parameters are listed in Table 2 . The simulated data and observed COVID-19 active cases for the 3 countries are fitted using R software for a specified time duration using maximum likelihood method. An elaboration of this model fitting technique is provided in [40] . The comparative plots related to confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases in these three most affected countries are shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6. From these figures, we get that the highest number of confirmed and death cases in the USA is 8048865, 218575, respectively. Among all these countries, Brazil has less number of confirmed cases (5200300). The highest number of recovered cases is in India (6453779) and lowest number of recovered cases is in the USA. Per day number of changes in the total number of confirmed cases and growth rate of confirmed cases for India, USA and Brazil are represented in Figs. 7, 8 and 9. Each figure contains two plots. The first one is a scatter plot with the number of changes between consecutive dates as a function of time. In this, the left vertical axis denotes linear scale and the right vertical axis denotes log-scale. So the curves in both the scales are combined here. The second plot displays a bar plot of the growth rate as a function of time for the particular country under consideration. Figure 10 displays the heatmaps that compare the changes per day and growth rate among the different countries under consideration. Here, countries are displayed on vertical axis and time on horizontal axis. From Fig. 10a , we conclude that the changes in the total number of confirmed cases in India are very high from August 2020 onward whereas corresponding changes in the USA and Brazil are much less. The USA shows higher changes in the month of July whereas Brazil shows spikes in July and also in August but it is for smaller duration of time. But the growth rates depicted in Fig. 10b are almost same in all the three countries during the considered period of time. The everyday pattern of data of total active cases of India, USA and Brazil for the considered time period is depicted in Fig. 11 . In the figure, it should be noted that day 1 in each plot matches with the first date of the data.",

This happens because these parameters have positive indices with R 0 . In a similar way, the parameters possessing negative indices with R 0 are \u03c3 m , p m , \u03b1 a , \u03bc and \u03bc s . Hence, increase in the values of these parameters results in decline in the R 0 value. We observe that for the parameter , the sensitivity index of R 0 is 1. This suggests that rise in by 1% will lead to 1% rise in R 0 . It is obvious that occurrence of a smaller R 0 value helps in controlling prevalence of the disease. Thus, to control the increasing number of disease cases, those parameters which have positive indices with R 0 must be brought under control, whereas the parameters having negative indices should be sustained. Hence, it is very crucial to consider all the preventive measures responsible for We further determine that the control parameters mentioned in the study, which include masks efficacy, quarantine efficiency, hospitalization efficacy, etc., which are in negative correlation with R 0 must be put forward by means of appropriate hygiene and adequate healthcare facilities.",

To obtain higher compliance of better-quality face masks, the epidemic threshold is shown below 1 by fixing the parameters as in Fig. 14 . Though vaccine is still under trial for the disease, different preventive ways involve practicing physical distancing, compulsory usage of face mask, frequent hand sanitation and perfect lockdown. Lockdown with leniency in the country failed to put a stop to the increasing number of cases. It is clearly presented from Figs. 16 and 17 that it would require almost 2 years for complete eradication of the disease from the world if higher quality face masks are used in public places. It is also obvious from these graphs that compulsory use of face masks in gatherings and open spaces is crucial in curbing community transmission of the disease, provided their coverage level is more.
