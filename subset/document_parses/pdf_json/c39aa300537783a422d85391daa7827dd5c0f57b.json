In principle, it would seem that the way to correct this would be to administer glucocorticoids, but this is not advisable to avoid the loss of T lymphocytes, which would reduce clinical efficacy. Anti-IL-6 drugs (with other indications) are available in the therapeutic armamentarium, such as tocilizumab [3] and sarilumab [4] , which block the IL-6 receptor, and siltuximab [5] , which blocks IL-6 itself (circulating ligand). They are the best candidates to neutralize the dreaded CRS, although tocilizumab is the only one to have an approved indication to treat CRS.

This is a multifaceted problem, but it will not be left unaddressed. Schematically, the disease can have two phases. In the first phase, the virus attaches to and penetrates the respiratory tree via the ACE-2 receptor; this phase is well known and the virus replicates at high speed in an asymptomatic manner with a variable incubation time (2 days to 2 weeks) [10] . The first symptoms appear in the second phase, where the immune system begins to manifest [11] . The process may stop here, without major problems.

The drug was administered to 30 patients with severe COVID-19 requiring ventilatory support under a compassionate use programme.

The researchers laid down the response to treatment as a decrease in the requirement of ventilatory support and resolution of the symptomatology of COVID-19. The results indicate that the change in cytokine profile after siltuximab treatment can be considered prognostic of outcome. Clinical findings reveal that siltuximab has a local effect of IL-6 inhibition in cutting down pulmonary inflammation by modulation of PTX3 [34, 35] . Furthermore, siltuximab also modulates IL-8 levels suggesting a suppressing of organic inflammation, which can prevent IL-8-mediated neutrophil recruitment and activation [36, 37] . Siltuximab showed beneficial effects in decreasing local and systemic inflammation, which were mirrored in enhanced survival and pulmonary function in patients with severe COVID-19 with moderate CRS [38] [39] [40] .",

The SILVAR study is a multicentre, randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of iv siltuximab in addition to standard care in in-patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS. The multi-centre trial will enrol about 400 patients with high serum IL-6 levels. The principal aim is to asses 28-day allcause mortality adding siltuximab to conventional treatment and contrasting with placebo and conventional treatment. Subsidiary endpoints for a normal male include time for clinical situation improvement, time in the ICU, days without organic disruption, days without ventilation, respiratory function and stay in hospital.",

The main objective of the assay was to study the association between the administration of these drugs and 28-day mortality versus standard treatment or placebo. Data from 27 RCTs, involving a total of 10,930 patients from 28 countries, were analysed. Nineteen trials included tocilizumab as an intervention, nine trials with sarilumab and only one trial with siltuximab. Administration of anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies was associated with lower mortality after 28 days. The simultaneous administration of IL-6 pathway inhibitors and corticosteroids provides better results than each drug in monotherapy. The best results of associations were those involving tocilizumab. The authors point out that this study has certain limitations. One is that some of the mentioned trials were not finished at the time of publication of the meta-analysis and have not been published in peer-reviewed journals. Another important limitation is the paucity of siltuximab results versus corticosteroids, so the results cannot be conclusive [45] .",

SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the innate immune system leading to an excess of response that may be related to increased lung damage and worse clinical outcome. As noted throughout the article, there may be two different phases of the disease, occurring consecutively in the most severe cases, although there is as yet no clear explanation as to why the second phase occurs mostly in older individuals. The first phase is triggered by the virus and the second by the host response. The treatment should be different in each of these phases. Supportive measures are the care standard, intended for controlling temperature, dehydration, constitutional and other clinical expressions. Given the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the absence of drugs and treatment guidelines, intensive research has been conducted in recent months and the use of certain drugs outside their initial indications has been encouraged. Efforts have been made to repurpose other clinically available drugs that have been tested in vitro or have been proposed as potentially useful for their mechanism of action. Likewise, new and experimental drugs with likelihood antiviral characteristics are being examined. However, therapies that modulate the hyperinflammatory host reaction are being envisaged as well. In some cases, it is assumed that the administration of antiviral drugs has benefits over the earliest disease stage when the illness is mediated by active viral replication. Immunomodulatory agents are assessed to be used over the subsequent proinflammatory course, which generally manifests as clinical worsening during the second week since symptom beginning.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated the existence of increased levels of IL-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines in subjects who suffer severe COVID-19 [57] . In addition to IL-6, the presence of IL-2, IL-7, IL-8, G-CSF, IL-17, TNFa and other markers indicating systemic inflammatory response have been detected. Significant production of cytokines and chemokines results in the recruitment of lymphocytes and leukocytes to the location of the infection. Nevertheless, a huge discharge of cytokines may take place in the framework of a positive feedback loop associated with the amplification of the immune response [11] . Hyperactivation of the immune system can lead to lymphocyte depletion associated with increased tissue damage, which is clinically observable in severe patients presenting with lymphopenia and hyperferritinaemia. This CRS would be associated with ARDS, which is found in the severe prognosis of COVID-19 coronavirus disease and has been described as the leading cause of mortality [13] . CRS therefore occurs when there is massive activation of leukocytes (neutrophils, macrophages and mast cells), which release a significant quantity of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in an uncontrolled manner, which at the same time can boost alveolarcapillary gas exchange, hence reducing oxygenation in lung tissue. This syndrome was initially described as an adverse effect of treatment with monoclonal antibodies, such as blinatumomab, and is also common in patients treated with CAR-T cells (chimeric antigen receptor T cells) [2] . In the latter case, treatment with IL-6 pathway inhibitors is recommended [58] .",

Clinical findings suggest that IL-6 plays a number of critical roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, haematopoiesis and acute phase reactions. Moreover, as mentioned above, IL-6 signalling occurs via a soluble and a membrane-bound receptor and these two pathways differ greatly in their biological consequences. While classical IL-6 signalling through the mIL-6R is mainly regenerative and protective, trans-IL-6 signalling through the sIL-6R is rather pro-inflammatory. The complex biology of IL-6 has implications for the therapeutic targeting of this cytokine. It is presumed that specific inhibition of the trans-signalling pathway may be greater than global blockade of IL-6 activity with the help of antibodies directed against IL-6 or IL-6R.",
