These changes will impact on the dynamics of riverine carbon cycles and food web structure and function. Here we investigate the principal sources of organic carbon supporting local shredder communities across a gradient in different levels of anthropogenic development along riverine reaches, in South Australia. In forested/wooded reaches with minimum to limited development, semiemergent macrophytes were the principal sources of organic carbon supporting the local shredder communities. However, in developed reaches, course particulate organic matter and filamentous algae were the principal food sources. The C:N ratios of the food sources in developed reaches were higher than those of their consumers indicating a stoichiometric mismatch. This imbalanced consumer-resource nutrient ratio in those developed reaches is likely to impose constraints on the growth and reproduction of their aquatic shredder communities with probable knock-on effects to higher trophic levels.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Identifying the principal food sources of aquatic invertebrates provides the basis for the understanding and management of riverine communities (Finlay 2001) .

Large variations in the C:N ratios of autotrophs occurs within and between ecosystems (Elser et al. 2000a ). The C:N ratio found in the primary sources varied considerably among sites with the same level of development and between sites with differing levels of development. Reasons for this discrepancy have been attributed to differences in resorption efficiency, nutrient availability and plant homeostatic regulation (Aerts 1996; Gusewell 2004) . However, regardless of the level of development across a broad range of food qualities and physiochemical environmental conditions , the primary macroinvertebrate consumers were relatively homeostatic in their C:N ratios and this is in accordance with other studies (Elser et al. 2000b; Cross et al. 2003 Cross et al. , 2005 Frost et al. 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 230, "text": "(Elser et al. 2000a", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 546, "end": 558, "text": "(Aerts 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 559, "end": 573, "text": "Gusewell 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 842, "end": 862, "text": "(Elser et al. 2000b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 863, "end": 880, "text": "Cross et al. 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 881, "end": 900, "text": "Cross et al. , 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 901, "end": 919, "text": "Frost et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nutritional constraints as a result of anthropogenic alterations"}, {"text": "The elemental composition of autotrophs is often out of balance with the nutritional demands of herbivorous animals (Elser et al. 2000a) .

This suggests that elemental imbalances between food resources and consumer requirements may be common in these systems . Many consumers selectively feed on high energy (high C) or high nutritive food resources or a specific combination thereof (Plath & Boersma 2001) . Both Amphipoda and Trichoptera selectively fed on vegetation group 3 across sites with modest to minimum anthropogenic developments. This vegetation group contained the lowest C:N ratio (Fig. 2) and therefore the highest nutritional content. In degraded riverine reaches there are limited food resources available, hence vegetation group 1 (CPOM) formed the main dietary components of Amphipoda even though it had the highest C:N ratio. At site 36, vegetation group 6 (filamentous algae) was the main dietary component of Trichoptera owing to its availability and its low C:N ratio in comparison to the other primary sources available.
