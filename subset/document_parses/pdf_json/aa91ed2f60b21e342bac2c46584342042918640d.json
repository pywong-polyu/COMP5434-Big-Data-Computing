Due to the lack of imaging examination, antipyretic and anti-infective medications were given. Although symptomatic treatment can relieve fever symptoms, symptoms easily flare up again two to three days after taking the drug. Later, the patient suffered from fever again during the COVID-19 epidemic and was sent to our hospital for isolation and treatment. During this hospitalization, chest CT examination is mandatory for all patients in order to meet the requirements of epidemic prevention and control. This led to the inadvertent discovery of a large cystic solid mass in the right thoracic cavity communicating with the esophageal lumen. The patient was preliminarily diagnosed as giant midesophageal diverticulum after three-dimensional CT image reconstruction of the chest was reviewed. Considering the patient's persistent fever with poor nutritional status, we decided to temporarily place two gastric tubes (diverticulum decompression and gastrointestinal nutrition), and antibiotics were used at the same time as another main treatment. However, after the symptoms eased and nutritional status improved, he refused all further treatment. We believe that this patient's diverticulum is very classic, and the treatment plan is highly integrated with the needs of epidemic prevention and control and achieves a satisfactory therapeutic effect, so we hope to provide colleagues with new diagnosis and treatment enlightenment through this case.",

            "text": "A 55-year-old man went to a village hospital for recurrent chills and fever without any other discomfort. This fever (highest 39\u00b0C) with chilly intermittently for 6 months. There was no significant family history or previously infectious disease such as pulmonary tuberculosis, mediastinitis, hilar lymphadenitis and tumors. Physical examination disclosed that breath sounds of both lungs were thick, and there are obvious wet rales in the right lung, cardiac rhythm and heart sound were normal. The results of laboratory examination indicated that neutrophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were all higher than normal values. No obvious abnormalities were found in the laboratory indexes of tumors. Due to limited medical conditions in primary hospitals, fever symptoms in patients are often thought to be caused by common influenza or upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Coincidentally, the cephalosporin anti-infective treatment was effective for his symptoms. However, symptoms were easy to flare up again two to three days after taking the drug. Later, the patient suffered from fever again during the COVID-19 epidemic and was sent to our hospital for isolation and treatment. Timely nucleic acid testing of SARS-CoV-2 was negative. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed a 7cm large pouch of the right esophageal wall below the level of the carina, filled with retained food, demonstrating giant midesophageal diverticula ( Figure 1 ). Due to concerns about the risk of perforation caused by persistent infection within the giant diverticulum, upper gastrointestinal imaging and gastrointestinal decompression within the diverticulum were performed simultaneously ( Figure 2 ). Through the placement of two gastric tubes (one was inserted into the diverticulum for suction residual chymus, the other was inserted into the stomach for supplying nutrition), we were able to provide good enteral nutritional support without causing residue accumulation within the diverticulum. After the patient's esophageal diverticulum was emptied by the gastric tube, we decided to perform a esophagogastroduodenoscopy examination to determine whether the patient had esophageal diverticulum canceration. This examination revealed a diverticulum with a wide orifice which was located 30cm from the incisor had no signs of inflammation, ulceration ( Figure 3 ). After fasting, closed drainage, antibiotic therapy, and nutritional support for a week, the patient's symptoms completely disappeared. However, he refused all further invasive therapy and admitted to the hospital regularly for review.",

            "text": "Esophageal diverticulum is a rare disease of the gastrointestinal system. Acquired esophageal diverticulum classified according to mechanisms of formation as pulsion or traction diverticulum, they may occur in the pharyngoesophageal transition area, midesophagus or distally (epiphrenic). Midesophageal diverticulum is traditionally considered traction diverticula secondary to mediastinal inflammatory reaction such as pulmonary tuberculosis, although anthracosis, histoplasmosis and treated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have also been reported. Because of the pulmonary tuberculosis, which is one of the primary causes of traction diverticulum, is in decline in the western world, recent studies have shown that midesophageal diverticulum is most often pulsion in nature. 1,2 Common symptoms of esophageal diverticulum include dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and aspiration. However, many patients with esophageal diverticulum presented no symptoms, which causes most esophageal diverticulum to be found incidentally. 3 Although esophageal radiography with an oral contrast agent is the most efficient diagnostic method for this disease, other investigations such as chest computed tomography is helpful in evaluating atypical symptoms or findings. Computed tomography could define a mass lesion arising from a perforated or malignant diverticulum, it is intuitively showing the location, size, shape of the esophageal diverticulum and its relationship with the chest trachea and the great blood vessels of the heart. Barium esophagram and other upper gastrointestinal radiography can only confirm the diagnosis of esophageal diverticulum, but the mucosal lesions in the esophagus and diverticulum cavity are not clearly diagnosed. 4 Chronic irritation by food residues, repeated inflammation of the cavity wall, and periodic damage and repair of the luminal mucosa may induce malignant lesions. 5 So, endoscopy is recommended irrespective of radiological appearances, it is essential for identifying esophageal tumors or strictures as causes of dysphagia, and in differentiating radiographic irregularities while permitting biopsies for histology. For symptomatic patients, surgery should be reserved. This is a consensus. The greatest risk of morbidity and mortality caused by non-surgical intervention is due to aspiration. Therefore, surgical intervention is mandatory when there is a risk of aspiration, even in the absence of esophageal symptoms. 6 Although midesophageal traction diverticula are usually small and do not require surgery, resection is the option in patients with large midesophageal diverticulum via thoracoscopy or thoracotomy such as diverticulectomy or additional esophageal myotomy. 7 In addition to traditional surgical treatment, minimally invasive endoscopic approaches have gained popularity in recent years. Endoscopic therapy usually includes endoscopic diverticulectomy, endoscopic submucosal dissection using a variety of special equipment, and diverticular peroral endoscopic myotomy. This allows patients to have more options for the treatment of the disease. The common complications of traditional surgical treatment such as perioperative aspiration, postoperative leaks and postoperative pneumonia should be fully considered. Although endoscopic approaches are regarded as lower complication rates and equivalent efficacy to conventional surgery, intraoperative esophageal perforation is one of the most frightening complications, which will lead to failure of endoscopic treatment or even immediate transfer to thoracotomy to save the patient's life. Treatment of a giant mid-esophageal diverticulum with endoscope is a difficult procedure and requires technical expertise. Regardless of the surgical option, the pros and cons should be carefully weighed, especially during the epidemic of COVID-19. 8 Unlike previous reports of esophageal diverticulum, our patient's chief complaint was fever rather than dysphagia or regurgitation. Unfortunately, many diseases can cause chills and fever, which inevitably leads doctors at primary hospitals to misdiagnose the disease. When the esophagus collapses, traction diverticula tend to empty, which further increases the Figure 2 Esophagogram demonstrated the \"mass\" is a giant esophageal diverticulum filled with food debris, no evidence of contrast medium leakage, and showed the distal esophagus was unobstructed without contrast agent stasis, and the mucosa and structure at the gastroesophageal junction were normal. Two nasogastric tubes were inserted (one was inserted into the esophagus for suction residual chymus, the other was inserted into the stomach for supplying nutrition). difficulty of diagnosing the disease through imaging. Fortunately, because of fever, he was highly suspected of being COVID-19 and was diagnosed as esophageal diverticulum when isolated in a larger hospital.",
