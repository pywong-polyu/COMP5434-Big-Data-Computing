In particular, we propose a modification of the popular Black-Karasinski model, which is widely used by practitioners for modeling interest rates, credit, and commodities. Our adjustment gives rise to the stochastic Verhulst model, which is well-known in the population dynamics and epidemiology as a logistic model. We demonstrate that the Verhulst model's dynamics are well suited to the current economic environment and the Fed's actions. Besides, we derive new integral equations for the zero-coupon bond prices for both the BK and Verhulst models. For the BK model for small maturities up to 2 years, we solve the corresponding integral equation by using the reduced differential transform method. For the Verhulst integral equation, under some mild assumptions, we find the closed-form solution.

For instance, the Vasicek-Hull-White model uses a linear mapping, while the Black-Karasinski (BK) uses an exponential mapping. The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model is an exception, which uses a driver governed by a Feller process. For short-rate models driven by OU processes, the rate spends an approximately equal amount of time below and above its equilibrium level. This assumption was valid for decades. However, as was mentioned earlier, it is no longer adequate due to the nontraditional interventions of central banks. Once the rate becomes low, it tends to stay low for a very long time. Under these circumstances, we have to revisit short-rate interest models and modify them to reflect prevailing current market conditions better. With this motivation in mind, we consider the popular BK model, which is widely used by practitioners for modeling interest rates, credit. A similar model, known as the Schwartz one-factor model, is often used to model commodities. The enduring popularity of the model is because, despite some lack of tractability, it is relatively simple and guarantees non-negativity of rates. Besides, one can calibrate it to a given term-structure of interest rates and prices or implied volatilities of caps, floors, or European swaptions, provided that the mean-reversion level and volatility are functions of time.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "For the reader's convenience, we provide some stylized facts about the BK model in Appendix A.1. As can be seen from Eq. (A.1), the short-interest rate r t in this model is lognormal and positive. (If necessary, it can be made negative by using a deterministic shift s(t).) Initially, this positivity was one of the significant advantages of the BK model. However, in the current environment, this feature seems to be less useful. Another problem with the model is in the lognormality of r t . Indeed, the lognormality means the CDF of the distribution is right-skewed. Therefore, the time a typical path stays in the lower rate area is short, because the short-rate quickly moves to the mean-reversion level. Accordingly, we need to choose a low mean-reversion speed to rectify this behavior, but the qualitative behavior of r t remains the same. In contrast, given the above discussion, we should design an interest rate model with fat tails at the lower end.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "In addition to the structural drawbacks, the BK model is not sufficiently tractable, especially when its coefficients are time-dependent. For instance, prices of zero-coupon bonds (ZCB) and highly liquid barrier options are not known in the close form. We have to find these prices numerically by solving the corresponding partial differential equations (PDEs), see Eq. (B.1), either via finite differences or asymptotically. In this paper, we present an attractive alternative, by deriving a novel integral equation for the ZCB price; see Appendix B. The corresponding integral equation can also be solved numerically. Moreover, for small maturities (up to 2 years or so), it can be solved by using the reduced differential transform method; see Appendix C.

At the same time, commercial banks switched to the narrow bank model, partly by choice and partly by necessity. The Federal Reserve has used short-term interest rates as the policy tool for achieving its macroeconomic goals. As a result, short rates were close to zero for much of the past decade, reflecting the effects of QE, low inflation caused by an aging population, and low productivity growth; see (Rudebusch, 2018) .
