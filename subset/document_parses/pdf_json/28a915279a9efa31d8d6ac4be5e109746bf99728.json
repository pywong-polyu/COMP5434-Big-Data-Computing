Non-adherence is related to people's understanding of their condition and its treatment, as well as perceived need for treatments and concerns about adverse consequences of treatments. 11 Self-care is particularly complex in eczema as it involves regular application of topical treatments (mainly emollients for maintenance and topical corticosteroids for inflamed eczema) and avoidance of triggers (eg, soap). At present, many people and families receive little advice on how to manage the condition, or obtain advice of variable quality from the internet. 12 There is a need for highquality, accessible interventions, as well as evidence of whether interventions work so that, if effective, clinicians can signpost towards these as an essential part of routine care.",

Patients and parents/carers find it difficult to know which information is reliable. 12 We have developed two web-based interventions to support eczema management: ECO (Eczema Care Online) for parents and carers of children aged 0-12 years with eczema, and ECO for young people aged 13-25 years with eczema. Parents of children with eczema and young people with eczema are likely to have different support and information needs. We have therefore developed two separate interventions to be evaluated in two separate randomised controlled trial (RCTs).

To prevent any discontinuity, the EQ-5D-Y will not be used in those under the age of 16 as this is a different instrument from the EQ-5D-5L. 37 38 All participants will be asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L at baseline, 24 and 52 weeks and the scores from these will be converted to utility scores using UK preference weights in line with current recommendations at the time of the analysis. 37 39 Following this, the utility values will be used to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for the trial period using linear interpolation and area under the curve with and without baseline adjustment. 40 Cost-effectiveness (using change in POEM between baseline and 52 weeks, secondary analysis) and cost utility analyses (primary analysis) will be performed. Costs and benefits will not be discounted given the 12-month timeframe. Using information on costs and benefits, regression analysis will be conducted to estimate the incremental cost, incremental benefit and incremental cost utility of the online intervention compared with usual care (over the trial period). If one arm is clearly dominant (less costly and more effective), a recommendation can be made on this basis. If non-dominance occurs (that is if costs are greater and the intervention is more effective or if the intervention is cheaper and less effective), an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be produced and a judgement about value for money will need to be made. The economic evaluation will be undertaken and analysed in line with guidelines. 41 42 Missing data will be dealt with in line with the approach taken in the main clinical statistical analysis, with sensitivity analysis undertaken to test the impact of approach if missing data is a particular problem. A detailed health economic analysis plan will be written and reviewed before the trial database is locked.",

The original protocol required parents or guardians of 13-15 year olds to return parental consent by post. 2. Increase in sample size. Our original sample size was 200 participants per trial, based on the published POEM MCID of 3. 45 However, research has since suggested that a smaller POEM MCID may be meaningful in certain contexts. 46 Recruitment to both trials exceeded expectation and a protocol amendment was made to change the sample size to a minimum of '200 participants' per trial to allow us to continue recruitment while a revised sample size was discussed with our Trial Management Group, Programme Management Group, Programme Steering Committee and funder, without access to study outcome data or any interim analysis. The final agreed sample size for the trials were based on seeking to detect a POEM MCID of 2.5 points between groups, based on two repeated measures (SD 6.5), allowing for 20% loss to follow-up requiring sample size of 303 participants in each of the two trials.",
