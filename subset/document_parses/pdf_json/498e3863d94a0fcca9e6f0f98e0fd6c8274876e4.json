Correspondingly, this study aims to record the daily COVID 19 cases and continue with the forecasting of the average daily demand (ADD) of healthcare facilities including beds, ICUs, and ventilators using ARIMA model. The forecasts were made for 3 rural populations located in the southern Amazon. The model shows that the healthcare ADD was different in each population. Likewise, the model forecasts that in a rural population that has the highest daily case with projected average cases equal to 67 cases/day (95%CI: 24, 110), that population has to fulfill healthcare ADD consisting of 57 beds/day (95%CI: 21, 93), 8 ICUs/day (95%CI: 2, 14), and 2 ventilators/day (95%CI: 2, 3). To conclude, the ARIMA model has addressed critical questions about ADD for beds, ICUs, and ventilators for rural residents. This ARIMA model based healthcare plan will hopefully provide versatile tool to improve healthcare resource allocations.",

This study is comparable to the other studies emphasizing on the healthcare conditions of rural inhabitants in savanna. The savanna due to its remoteness and geographic accessibility (Ihantamalala et al. 2020 , Migu\u00e9is et al. 2018 may restrict access of inhabitants to the appropriate healthcare facilities. Cisse (2011) reported that numbers of health centers at the close proximity were low in the rural savanna and this has hindered residents to get vaccination and medical treatment at a lower cost. The rural resident activities which most of the residents' livelihoods were depending on the agricultural sectors would pose a threat as well. During the start of the agricultural season, all residents will begin their farming activities in the pastoral fields. This may reduce the potential of disease transmitted among residents since the residents are spreading out from rural settlements. Nonetheless, in the pastoral field, the rural residents were in greater proximity without social distancing (Hughes and Hughes 2020) due to the collective works and this will increase their risks for infections (URD 2020).",

Nonetheless in the end, the parameters values can be identified from the actual data to reduce errors in model predictions. Since the model is developed using measurable parameters, the model calculations can be updated as the actual data of the parameters become available in the long run (Basu 2020).Projected model is a versatile tool that can measure a healthcare provider capacity to fulfill the healthcare facility demand.
