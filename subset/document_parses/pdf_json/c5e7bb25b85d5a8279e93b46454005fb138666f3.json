Little is known regarding the changes in kinetics of neutrophils phenotypes in inflammatory conditions. During acute inflammation more heterogeneity was found, characterized by an increase in CD16 dim banded neutrophils. These cells were probably released from the bone marrow (left shift). Acute inflammation induced by human experimental endotoxemia (LPS model) was additionally accompanied by an immediate increase in a CD62L low neutrophil population, which was not as explicit after injury/trauma induced acute inflammation. The situation in sub-acute inflammation was more complex. CD62L low neutrophils appeared in the peripheral blood several days (>3 days) after trauma with a peak after 10 days. A similar situation was found in the blood of COVID-19 patients returning from the ICU. Sorted CD16 low and CD62L low subsets from trauma and COVID-19 patients displayed the same nuclear characteristics as found after experimental endotoxemia. In diseases associated with chronic inflammation (stable COPD and treatment naive HIV) no increases in CD16 low or CD62L low neutrophils were found in the peripheral blood. All neutrophil subsets were present in the bone marrow during homeostasis. After LPS rechallenge, these subsets failed to appear in the circulation, but continued to be present in the bone marrow, suggesting the absence of recruitment signals. Because the subsets were reported to have different functionalities, these results on the kinetics of neutrophil subsets in a range of inflammatory conditions contribute to our understanding on the role of neutrophils in health and disease.",

During acute inflammation, such as experimental endotoxemia, in severe trauma and (bacterial) infection, different subsets of neutrophils are found in the circulation (8) (9) (10) (11) . These subsets can be visualized by CD16 and CD62L expression in flowcytometry (8, 12, 13) . CD16, or FcgRIIIB, is a PI-linked cell surface receptor on neutrophils for the Fc region of IgG (14) . CD62L, or L-selectin, is a selectin important in cell adhesion, particularly under flow conditions (15) . At homeostasis, circulating neutrophils display a high expression of both CD16 and CD62L. However, during inflammation two additional subsets of CD16 low cells and/or CD62L low neutrophils can be found in the circulation (4, 5) .",

(17) . For this study, a waiver for formal ethical approval was provided by the institutional medical ethics committee under protocol number 20-284/C. In short, COVID-19 suspected patients were included upon presentation at the emergency department, where also the first 4 mL blood sample was taken in a sodium heparin tube. All patients were tested for the presence of virus by SARS-CoV-2specific PCR. Patients were categorized as \"COVID-19 positive\" if PCR results came back positive. For the specific sub-analysis of pre-and post ICU patients in this study, only male and (nonpregnant) female patients were selected from the database, who had at least one sample taken on the COVID-19 ward <7 days after ICU discharge. Nine of these patients also had data from pre-ICU measurements that were analyzed. Unfortunately, no samples could be obtained during ICU stay. Five patients were excluded from the analysis because they did not have a post-ICU measurement within 7 days after ICU discharge or due to inhospital death. Relevant clinical data was extracted from the patient files. For baseline characteristics, see Table 1 .",

In addition to the FMO's, we used the CD62L high lymphocyte population in every sample to determine the placement of the CD62L low gate for neutrophils. The CD16 low gate was set based on the intersection between CD62L low cells and CD16 low cells. By using this method, a reliable quantification of neutrophil subsets based on CD16 and CD62L could be made, despite the differences between the different flow cytometers and settings.

            "text": "Neutrophil CD16/CD62L-based subsets were studied and compared under different inflammatory conditions, ranging from (hyper) acute to subacute and chronic inflammation. The distribution patterns and kinetics of CD16 low , CD16 high CD62L high and CD62L low neutrophils in the different types of inflammation indicated a very dynamic control of these cells in the peripheral blood. In addition to conventional mature CD16 high CD62L high neutrophils, CD16 low neutrophils with a band shaped nucleus were predominantly recruited to the circulation during the hyper acute phase after an inflammatory insult. The occurrence of young band-form neutrophils is a well-known phenomenon and generally referred to as a \"left shift\" (27) . These CD16 low banded neutrophils were only present for a couple of hours to maximally a few days during acute inflammation after trauma and LPS challenge and were conspicuously absent from the circulation thereafter, as shown in subacute trauma and COVID-19 patients as well as in chronic conditions such as COPD and HIV infection (treatment na\u00efve). Thus, the CD16 low cells seem to be present only in the very acute moment of an inflammatory insult and disappear within approximately a day (as can be seen in the longitudinal trauma data). Since COVID-19 patients were already infected for at least a few days before their blood was analyzed, our data set cannot ascertain whether CD16 low cells were present or absent in the acute phase of the disease. The CD62L low subset showed more complex kinetics. These cells appear in the circulation during acute inflammation evoked by experimental endotoxemia, but to a much lesser extent at the day of admission after trauma. During the subacute follow-up after trauma these cells increased in circulating counts and showed the typical hypersegmented nuclei. When inflammation is chronic, like is the case in COPD and HIV infection, the neutrophil subset profile returned to normal, indicating an attempt to restore a balance in the neutrophil compartment. The seemingly normalized situation in chronic disease could be based on the same mechanism of action driving the desensitization to a second LPS challenge, as found in the human experimental endotoxemia model. However, the observation that the subset profile in the blood returned to normal, does not exclude the possibility that neutrophil numbers could remain elevated in the tissues during chronic inflammation.",

            "text": "Circulatory CD62L low neutrophils were higher in activation markers such as CD11b, as has been demonstrated before (28) . In this study no functional capacities of the neutrophil subsets were tested. However, Hesselink et al. previously published data on the phagocytosis and phagolysosomal acidification capacity of CD16/CD62L neutrophil subsets in trauma patients (10) . These capacities are of major importance in the defense against pathogens. It was shown that the CD16 low subset displayed a better phagolysosmal acidification capacity when compared to \"normal\" CD16 high /CD62L high neutrophils. The CD62L low subset on the other hand showed a trend towards a reduced acidification capacity (10) . The actual bacterial containment of the different subsets can be tested in a containment assay with S. aureus, like the one described by Van Grinsven et al. (29) . In this assay CD62L low cells of volunteers after LPS administration were previously shown to exhibit decreased antibacterial function (8, 10) . Even more interesting, CD62L low neutrophils were shown to have more immunoregulatory characteristics that could be important for keeping balance in the immune response (7, 13) and maybe even recovery of tissues (30) . The presence of high counts of CD62L low neutrophils with immunosuppressive properties in the circulation might also have a flipside. It is known that trauma patients are highly susceptible to infections (31) . The presence of high counts of CD62L low neutrophils during the days to weeks following severe trauma might play a significant role in the infectious prone state these patients are in (9) . The first infectious complications arise at the end of the first week after trauma (32) . This coincides with the rising counts of CD62L low cells during the first week after trauma, peaking at day 10. However, this observation needs to be further explored to investigate whether there is a (causal) relationship between the occurrence of CD62L low cells and the presence of infections. In addition, it is also possible that trauma patients are desensitized for additional stimuli after the first big inflammatory hit of the initial trauma and are therefore not able to mount an adequate response to invading pathogens. These patients often undergo surgeries in the days after initial trauma, causing extra stress on the innate immune system. In the endotoxemia model we showed that after a second challenge with LPS, a week after the first challenge, less CD16 low cells were recruited to the circulation, like was shown before. Also the CD62L low neutrophil counts were lower in blood during a second challenge, but this difference was not as pronounced as seen for the CD16 low cells when compared to the first challenge (24) . It appears the same inflammatory insult evokes a less pronounced response after a primary challenge. This situation is comparable to the situation of trauma patients, who also undergo multiple inflammatory hits. Two explanations for the lack of CD16 low neutrophil recruitment to the circulation could be: 1) the bone marrow was devoid of CD16 low cells after the first LPS challenge and not yet replenished, or 2) CD16 low neutrophils were present in the bone marrow but failed to be recruited. We showed that the same percentage of CD16 low cells was still present in the bone marrow after the second LPS stimulus, compared to baseline bone marrow samples. In addition, it is demonstrated that there is notably less change in plasma cytokine and chemokine levels after re-challenge (25, 33) . This suggests an adaptation of the innate immune response after multiple inflammatory stimuli. Although historically a memory immune response was reserved for the adaptive immune system, it has recently become clear that even the innate immune system can adapt its response. This has been coined 'trained immunity' by Netea et al. in case of an increased responsiveness to a secondary challenge (26) and 'tolerance' or 'immunoparalysis' in case of an attenuated responsiveness to a secondary challenge (33, 34) . Immunoparalysis might account for the susceptibility of trauma patients to secondary infections (34) (35) (36) .",

            "text": "The origin of CD62L low cells appearing in the circulation during inflammation is still unknown (37) . We demonstrated that CD62L low neutrophils were present in de bone marrow during homeostasis and also in small amounts in the circulation of healthy subjects. The CD62L low neutrophils in the bone marrow did not show pronounced hypersegmentation of the nucleus, in contrast to the circulating CD62L low neutrophils found after experimental endotoxemia, subacute trauma and in post-ICU COVID-19 patients. Because the lobularity of CD62L low neutrophils in the bone marrow is less, it is unlikely that all these cells are old circulatory CD62L low neutrophils returning to the bone marrow to undergo apoptosis (38) . Whether the CD62L low neutrophils in the bone marrow are the precursors of the CD62L low neutrophils in the circulation or whether these are different subsets, remains to be investigated. We have previously demonstrated that the circulatory CD62L low neutrophils cluster separately from CD16 low and CD16 high CD62L high neutrophils after analysis of proteomic profiling data, suggesting a separate CD62L low neutrophil lineage (7) . If the CD62L low neutrophils from the bone marrow are their precursors, this would imply that the increased lobularity and expression of activation markers in the circulation needs to be achieved shortly after the inflammatory stimulus, since we found these cells in the circulation within three hours after LPS (13) . Alternatively, CD62L low neutrophils in the circulation are separate from their bone marrow counterparts and might be cells which shed CD62L during extravasation (20) , got activated in the (inflamed) tissue and returned from the tissues to the circulation (39) . The increased levels of activation markers of CD62L low cells in the circulation during inflammatory conditions, as shown in this work and previously (28) , is in line with this hypothesis.",

            "text": "This study also has its limitations. Different flow cytometers were used to gather the data for this study. This comes with a few challenges regarding differences in settings, different antibody panels and different machine properties. However, we found a method to reliably gate the different CD16/CD62L neutrophil subsets based on CD62L high lymphocyte populations. This made it possible to still make a valid comparison between different datasets. Another challenge was the samples size in some of the used datasets. Especially the LPS cohort had a relatively small sample size of n=10. This might have caused a lack of statistical power. However, the human experimental endotoxemia model is performed in a highly controlled setting and therefore is not influenced by possible confounders like age, comorbidities or effects of treatment, like is the case for trauma and COVID-19 patients. The timing of sample collection is also a point of discussion, especially in the acute moment after trauma. Since the CD16 low subset is only present in the very acute moment and the cell counts of this subset already start to decline within the same day after sever injury, it is vital that the sample is taken as soon as possible. However, in our data there is some variation in timing of the first sample. Some samples are taken in the trauma bay right after arrival in the hospital (day 0), but for some patients direct blood sampling was not possible and a blood sample was taken a few hours after admission. These samples are pooled in the group \"day 0.5\". However, this might have caused some variation in the data, since not all samples are taken at the same time point after trauma. During the follow up of the trauma patients, different confounders were introduced due to infectious complications, interventions or drug therapy (corticosteroids, antibiotics e.a) that could have influenced our data. It is known that surgical interventions and mechanical ventilation have pronounced effects on the innate immune system (40, 41) . Severely injured patients often undergo a combination of these procedures, probably causing at least part of the variation in the longitudinal data. Nevertheless, the temporal pattern of the neutrophil subset response to trauma is still evident.",
