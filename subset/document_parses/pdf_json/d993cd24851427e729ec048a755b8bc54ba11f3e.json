Using click chemistry reaction, Ji et al. [28] cyclized Spiegelmer(RNA aptamer) to obtain a significant improvement in binding affinity and selectivity toward the target protein. Specifically, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay(EMSA) showed that the binding affinity of circular RNA aptamer was increased ten-fold than that of the linear. Interestingly, a circular DNA library based on a 15-nucleotides(nt) thrombin binding aptamer(TBA15) with two symmetrical random regions and two constant regions was designed by Mao and co-workers [29] . They successfully selected the circular aptamer CTBA4T-B1 containing a central quadruplex and two long stem-loops[ Fig.1(A) ]. According to the stability assay, the circular aptamer CTBA4T-B1 depending on the cross linking of bases showed high stability. Besides, the affinity of circular aptamer CTBA4T-B1 increased about 1000-fold compared to the linear mother sequences. Moreover, Li et al. [30] reported that cyclization via base complementary pairing could facilitate transferrin receptor(TfR) aptamerinduced permeability of the blood-brain-barrier and enhance the binding ability of Tau aptamer, showing the broad prospects of circular aptamers in diagnosis and therapy. These studies above indicated that cyclization is a direct and effective strategy to improving the target recognition properties of aptamers.",

According to the simulated new secondary structure, the 24-mer aptamer retained a hairpin structure the same as the parental full-length(39-mer) aptamer. And the binding affinity between the truncated 24-mer aptamer and phthalate esters(PAE) was improved by 1.5-fold than that of the original 39-mer aptamer.

[68] obtained DNA aptamers A1 that could specifically bind to the extracellular domain of BACE1 and suppress the activity of BACE1, decreasing APP expression and A\u03b2 production. This provides preliminary feasibility of developing a potential BACE1 binding aptamer inhibitor. Simultaneously, two DNA aptamers against BACE1 were identified by Cai's group [69] . The two identified aptamers interacted with BACE1 and significantly inhibited the activity of BACE1 in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer(FRET) assay, avoiding A\u03b2-induced neuronal deficiency. Recently, Gasse and co-workers [70] utilized a 5-Chlorouracil modified aptamer(single-stranded xenonucleic acid, ssXNA) recognizing the BACE1 ectodomain to realize the regulation of BACE1 catalytic activity.",

Subsequently, D-aPDL1 was constructed by the aPDL1 aptamer modified with dibenzocyclooctyne(DBCO), and the PD-L1 was labeled with azides via metabolizing. Finally, the D-aPDL1 aptamer could covalently conjugate azide-labeled PD-L1 via click reaction to precisely inhibit the activation of PD-L1 and mediate antitumor immunotherapy.Apart from blocking the immune checkpoint, aptamers modified innate immune cell is an effective strategy to perform targeted cancer immunotherapy and regulate the immune response. Yang et al.[82] constructed aptamerengineered natural killer cells(ApEn-NK) with synthetic CD30-specific aptamers anchored on NK cells, triggering apoptosis of CD30-expressed lymphoma cells. In another similar research, Shi et al.[83] synthesized a polyvalent antibody mimic(PAM) composed of supramolecular aptamer in situ. They found that the killing rate of NK cells conjugated with PAM was improved 2.73 times than that of the natural NK cells. Moreover, a strategy of loading aptamers on the innate immune cells was also proposed by Zhang et al.[78] to improve adoptive immunotherapy[Fig.5(B)]. Two aptamers, specifically HepG2 cell binding aptamer TLS11a and PD-L1 aptamer were tightly coupled on the surface of the NK cell.On one hand, aptamers-equipped NK cells induced more secretion of immune cytokines and thus enhanced adoptive immune responses compared with parental NK cells. On the other hand, PD-L1 aptamer located on the NK cell could interact with PD-L1 that was highly expressed on the membrane of HepG2 cell, suppressing PD-1/PD-L1 signal and enhancing immunotherapy. These studies demonstrate that aptamers can regulate cellular immunity by blocking immune checkpoints or modifying non-specific immune cells.",

            "text": "the same time, the biological process regulation of aptamers in enzymatic activity, cellular immunity and cellular behavior is concluded. We found that aptamers have made a lot of progress, but there is still a little space for improvement.First, the kinds of high-affinity aptamers are limited. Due to the long period of screening and complex environmental factors, such as pH, temperature and concentration, some selected high-abundance sequences are not highly specific. Second, methods to improve the affinity of aptamers need to be improved. Taking chemical modification as an example, there are few types of replacement elements and artificial bases of aptamers, and chemically modified aptamers are also confined by the compatibility of traditional screening techniques. Third, poor stability and short circulation time in vivo restrict the long-term development of aptamers in biological process regulation. Despite these challenges, aptamers in property and biological process regulation will receive further developments in the near future. Especially, new advances that improve the screening efficiency and aptamer property have emerged. For instance, the recent popular microfluidic screening incorporating high-throughput sequencing technologies may be possible to effectively shorten the screening time and develop more high-affinity aptamers. Expanding the genetic alphabet and assembling aptamers that recognize different epitopes of the same target should be useful to enhance aptamer affinity. Besides, aptamers functionalized nanomaterials have largely overcome the https://doi.org/10.1007/s40242-022-2087-9",
