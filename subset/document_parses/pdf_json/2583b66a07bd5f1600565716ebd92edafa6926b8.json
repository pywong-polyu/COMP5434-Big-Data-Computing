As of this writing, COVID-19 conversations across the globe are becoming less and less concerning, as wealthy nations ramp up testing and triple-vaccinate their citizens, as COVID-19-related infection and hospitalization rates fall significantly, or, as is the case of the less developed countries of the Global South, concerted efforts are being made to have a sizable number of residents tested for COVID-19 and inoculated with their first shot. In developed economies, the pendulum of healthcare uneasiness is pivoting toward a simple issue-endemicity-as governments ease or phase out COVID-19 restrictions, as the disease is increasingly being viewed through the lens of, say, the seasonal flu, and as agitation against COVID-19 mandates leads to protests in countries such as the Netherlands, France and Canada. The world will get by, the argument goes, by coexisting with COVID-19 as it does with a host of other diseases, including the seasonal influenza, dengue, and malaria. But applying such a view now to the pandemic may be inadvisable, as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, asserts: \" We're concerned that a narrative has taken hold in some countries that because of vaccines, and because of Omicron's high transmissibility and lower severity, preventing transmission is no longer possible and no longer necessary. Nothing could be further from the truth. More transmission means more disease (1).\" But the world need not have been so ravaged by the pandemic only if it had looked around to remind itself about commonsensical steps that could have been considered in response.",

In Japan, the effects of COVID-19 are not limited to clinical settings; the disease has had clear implications for the country's political outcomes. Yoshihide Suga, Japan's former prime minister, left office in just 1 year, following criticisms leveled at his government for its initially slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, the resulting spikes in COVID-19 infections, and the fallout from his government's refusal to approve compensation for economic injury suffered by furloughed workers because of a slump in the business sector. In national elections held early in October 2021, his successor, Fumio Kishida, of the same Liberal Democratic Party, won a clear majority in Japan's lower, more powerful parliamentary chamber, signaling a refreshing resolve by Japan to reduce significantly chances for any uptick in the spread of the coronavirus, thus placing the country firmly on a trajectory toward achieving herd immunity.",

As of February 2022, Japan had more than 3.3 million confirmed cases, 19,341 deaths, 144.5 deaths per million inhabitants (or 14.47 per 100,000). Statistics from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare show that while Japan's number of newly confirmed daily cases has risen to an average of 89.489 in February 2022, the number of severe cases has dropped by half compared to the number in September 2021 (5) . Another reassuring trend is in the comparison of the age of positive cases with that of severe cases and morbidity: As of February 2022, the highest age range for new COVID-19 cases for males and females was 20-29 years, yet, the highest number of severe cases and mortality was among males older than 70 years. Among Japanese children, the trends have also been encouraging: During the Delta wave (August-September 2021), the number of children (1.4% of COVID-19 admissions to intensive care units) treated for COVID-19 infections was 14 times higher than was the case before the Delta surge between October 2020 and May 2021 (6) . During periods before and after the Delta wave, there were no reported deaths among infected children.",

The first of such forces is the government's clear, consistent, forthright public announcements on an antidote to the health crisis. (To ensure consistency in COVID-19 messaging, only the national government, through the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, makes countrywide announcements on the virus).

Japan is an exception, but not because of its collectivistic attribute. It must be noted here that, on the one hand, the common view that Japan is a collectivistic society whereas the United States is individualistic has not been empirically substantiated (16) . On the other, consistent with modernization theory-which posits the rise of individualism in both Japan and the United States because of economic growth and modernizationcollectivism, which subordinates individual goals to family, tribal, organizational or national goals, persists in highly developed East Asian societies such as modern Japan, posing a challenge to modernization theory (17) . In response to the inconclusiveness of research findings on that sociocultural binary, Vignoles argues that, because that widely accepted binary culture seems oversimplified and is of limited value, emphasis should be placed on, say, defining concepts more precisely and expanding investigations of cultural identities and stereotypes (18) .",

As a matter of habit, the Japanese wear face masks during flu season to reduce their chances of infecting others rather than becoming infected. This act of preventing infections to others exemplifies the selfless behaviors of the Japanese, contributing to the low number of COVID-19 cases and related fatalities. Japan's approach to catastrophes such as the March 11, 2011, triple-disaster reflected a cultural policy of a cohesive, united front among the Diet, municipalities, and ward offices across Tokyo and northern Japan. Shortly after March 11, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government imposed conservation limits for energy use throughout Tokyo. As a result, ward offices across Tokyo closed their pools, limited the routine use of electricity, and shut down elevators and escalators across the city. Not only did Tokyo wards meet the limits, they also exceeded them.",
