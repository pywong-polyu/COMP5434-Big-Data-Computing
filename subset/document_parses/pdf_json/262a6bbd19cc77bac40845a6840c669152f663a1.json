            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , is an infectious disease that threatens the lives of millions worldwide. COVID-19 emerged in China in 2019 and rapidly spread across the globe. 1 According to the WHO, COVID-19 has caused nearly five million deaths and over 251 million confirmed positive cases. In Iraq there have been about 23 thousand deaths and 2 million confirmed positive cases. 2 COVID-19 spreads between individuals by respiratory droplets and/or physical contact. The symptoms of most cases extended from being asymptomatic to mild illness with fewer than 20% experiencing severe or life-threatening complications. Medical comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and immunodeficiency diseases increase the severity of the illness. 3 Nevertheless, patients without such diseases can still develop severe COVID-19, which requires intensive inpatient medical attention. 4 In addition to the substantial effect of the pandemic on the health of the individuals and societies globally, COVID-19 has other significant detrimental effects, including social and economic. 5 The COVID-19 outbreak in Iraq has caused major alarm to the country's fragile health infrastructure. Iraq reported its first case of COVID-19 on 21 February 2020. 6 To try to control the rapid spread of the pandemic, Iraqi health authorities implemented a lockdown involving some public sectors. 7 Yet, failure to control the situation had led to a total lockdown as well as enforcing strict preventative measures including social distancing, face masks, and banning social gatherings. 8 Infection and mortality rates hit their peaks in July and August, peaking to 12185 reported cases on 27 July 2021. 2 The rise in cases encouraged experts to adopt various treatment protocols, though with limited success. More convenient and efficient measures to halt or possibly end COVID-19 pandemic were therefore sought, particularly development of a vaccine. 9 Vaccines have been the cornerstone in controlling and preventing several infectious epidemic diseases. 9, 10 Thus, huge efforts by global pharmaceutical companies were directed towards creating efficient and safe vaccines to address the COVID-19 pandemic. 9 While some companies utilized old technologies in manufacturing the vaccine like live attenuated or dead virus forms, others embarked on developing advanced genetically engineered vaccines. Nonetheless, companies were under enormous pressure to speed up the production of vaccines which led to doubts in their public on their efficacy and safety. Despite of this, the urgency of the situation called for immediate initiation of vaccination protocols all over the world, including Iraq. 9 Importantly, a previous study showed that the vast majority of side effects disappeared 1-3 days after immunization, which is encouraging from a safety standpoint. 11 Moreover, a recent study has established a protocol for tracking COVID-19 vaccines' side effects 12 which confirms the safety of COVID-19 vaccine. Iraq received its first COVID-19 vaccines at the end of March 2021. 13 The Ministry of Health sent vaccines to health institutions throughout the country to be used in protecting people from priority groups according to the national vaccine deployment plan and framework. By the end of July 2021 only 7.4% of the targeted Iraqis were vaccinated against COVID-19. 2 Vaccine hesitancy is a long-standing problem that poses a severe threat to global health, as seen by the return of infectious diseases such as measles and pertussis. 14 The rapid development of effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines was remarkable. Nonetheless, vaccination reluctance for COVID-19 could be a significant barrier to global efforts to contain the pandemic and limit its health and socioeconomic consequences. Previous work has indicated that the Middle East has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates 14 Low vaccination rates have been attributed to conspiracy views, which has resulted in a negative attitude toward immunization. 15 No information about the COVID-19 acceptance rate or the association factors for vaccination acceptance have yet been reported for Iraq. This study will be the first to quantify the vaccine acceptance in the general Iraqi population, evaluate variables associated with vaccination acceptance and shed light on the reasons of vaccine hesitancy.",

The first section contains questions related to demographic information, including city, gender, age, smoking, economic, and marital status, pregnancy, education, and whether the participant has children or not. The second section includes questions about the health status of the participants and whether the participant had received the flu vaccine during the past year. The third section investigates experiences with COVID-19, including whether the participant was exposed to infection or if he/she knows someone who has been exposed to the virus. The fourth part contains questions about the knowledge of COVID-19, including viral transmission method, symptoms, and the use of different means of protection. The fifth and final part of the questionnaire evaluated COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, and reasons for hesitancy/refusal for vaccination. This study adopted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) risk for severe COVID-19 infection and the study participants' risk-degree were classified accordingly. 3 Knowledge and practice scores were computed for each participant. The knowledge scores were based on knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission method and preventive measures. One point was given for each correct answer, with a maximum possible score of 19 (Table 3 ). Practice scores were the sum of the practices reported for the question \"Which protective measures have you taken to protect yourself from COVID-19?\" (Table 4 ). Responses were from \"Never\" (1 point) to \"All the time\" (5 points), with a maximum possible score of 25.",

As only 7 participants answered \"Maybe\" to the question \"If a vaccine is offered to you for COVID-19, are you willing to take it?\" they were excluded from the analysis and stepwise (forward conditional) binary regression was conducted to evaluate variables associated with vaccine acceptance (Yes vs No), the model included all the variables listed in the practice model in addition to the participants' practice level.",

This replicates other studies conducted in Iraq and showed high knowledge about COVID-19. 19, 20 Similarly, several surveys undertaken globally have found high levels of knowledge concerning COVID-19, including surveys conducted in the general community in Malaysia, 21 China, 22 Saudi Arabia, 23 and Jordan. 24 Most of the participants in our survey were either graduates or postgraduates, with high incomes. They exhibited a good understanding of the symptoms of COVID-19, route of infection, and precautionary measures. They also knew that there is currently no cure for COVID-19. Media coverage, and the influence of the epidemic on social life, which pushes people to comply with health guidance, could explain the good awareness among participants. This study showed that female participants as well as married participants have better knowledge related to COVID-19. This corroborates earlier work conducted in Jordan about misconceptions concerning COVID-19 which found that women and single participants have more misconceptions. 15 Like previous studies, females were more likely to regard COVID-19 as a significant health issue, and endorsed policies and measures enacted to protect against it. 25 Similarly, we discovered that people who have children had greater knowledge than those who did not. This outcome could be attributed to parents' increased anxiety for their children, which may have led to following the media more closely for information related to COVID-19. Several studies have 22 reported a strong relationship between knowledge and demographic variables including gender, age, and occupation, which is parallel to our findings. Awareness was higher among educated people, as found in earlier investigations. 26 In a study conducted in Egypt and Nigeria, participants had good awareness of COVID-19. Knowledge scores were linked to age group 18-39, college/degree, undergraduate education and participants' backgrounds. 27 A study conducted in Pakistan found a link between good health and education, and acceptable attitudes and practices. 28 In line with our findings, the majority of Malaysians had good knowledge, positive attitudes and good practices related to COVID-19. These were attributed to successful healthcare and government campaigns. 21 In the Middle East, numerous gaps in public knowledge related to COVID-19 have been highlighted, which suggests that health education be used to improve education. 29 ",

Being male and having less knowledge were predictors of poor practice scores, while perceived seriousness of COVID-19 was an indicator of high practice scores. These findings mimic previously reported correlations between knowledge and protective practices against COVID-19 which may be affected by several factors including COVID-19 induced anxiety. 31 These findings replicate other studies that found females a greater sense of responsibility than similarly-aged males. 22 Most of our survey participants had a positive outlook and stated that if offered a COVID-19 vaccine they are willing to take it, as well as taking a PCR test to make sure they are not infected.

The pandemic has had a significant influence on Iraqi's work, income, and daily lives. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Iraq has taken substantial efforts and applied public health initiatives to address these challenges, and these actions have significantly halted the disease's spread. 34 The high rate of COVID-19 vaccinations among Iraqi adults may be explained by the positive attitude and extensive knowledge of COVID-19 and concerns related to the impact of the pandemic, as they perceive greater benefits than risks to vaccination. Moreover, this study showed that the predictors of responding \"no\" regarding intent to be vaccinated were low education and income, not being infected by COVID-19, and not believing COVID-19 to be a serious disease. Educational and income levels were also reported in a study conducted in Malaysia on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. 35 Furthermore, more efforts should be made to vaccinate vulnerable people such as people with dementia. 36 ",

            "text": "Despite the high acceptance rate, barriers still remain in shifting from intention to acceptance. Reservations about vaccine efficacy, safety and side effect have been identified as a major impediment to vaccination decisions, particularly for newly launched vaccinations that have not been thoroughly evaluated in the real world. Similarly, previous work found that 13% of Australians reported that they would wait to see if any negative side effects occurred before agreeing to be vaccinated, although their acceptance rate was 67%. 37 The vaccine hesitancy found in this study could be due to: concern about the vaccine (mainly the safety and the efficacy); the need for additional information on the vaccine and the availability of information about the vaccine, and a lack of trust in authority. Moreover, reservations about new vaccines, new emerging infectious diseases, and apprehension about pharmaceuticals have all been reported as likely to influence vaccine acceptance. 38 The hesitancy we found may decrease, when a nonemergency vaccine becomes accessible. Importantly, once the safety of newly introduced vaccinations is equivalent to that of existing vaccines, this factor loses prominence in vaccination decision-making in favor of other factors such as effectiveness. 39 This therefore necessitates a greater emphasis on vaccine safety in new vaccines, and in other vaccine characteristics, such as price and convenience, in order to increase uptake. Studies conducted in the UK, France, and Australia found varying results on the effect of socio-demographic characteristics on pandemic vaccine acceptance. [40] [41] [42] In our study, the main socio-demographic characteristics that influence vaccine hesitancy are working in a medical field, being infected before and knowing the seriousness of the disease. This replicates findings from previous work conducted in Jordan. 14 Our findings can be used to develop targeted campaigns toward the effectiveness of the vaccination and immunization programs for people who are afraid of vaccines. Furthermore, information about vaccine safety should form part of a simultaneous health education campaign to reduce concerns about vaccine safety. 43 To boost overall vaccine acceptance and public compliance in the event of future pandemics, various sectors, including health departments should undertake consistent education initiatives for nonpandemic infectious diseases such as influenza. 43 ",
