This metabolic signature, based solely on information extracted from the urine spectrum, adds a molecular dimension to MetS definition and it was used to generate models that can identify subjects with MetS (AUROC values between 0.83 and 0.87). This signature is particularly suitable to add meaning to the conditions that are in the interface between healthy subjects and MetS patients. Aging and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are also risk factors that may enhance MetS probability, but they do not directly interfere with the metabolic discrimination of the syndrome.",

This comparison employed Wilcoxon nonparametric hypothesis testing for each bin to identify those with a statistically significant difference (p-value < 0.05), after adjustment by the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method to control for Type I errors due to multiple comparisons. Binary logarithms of fold-changes (log 2 FC) were used to quantify the magnitude and direction of differences. Fold-changes were calculated as the average of a variable within the target condition divided by its average within the apparently healthy condition. Different conditions and bins were clustered and organized as dendrograms in heatmaps, using hierarchical clustering by the complete-linkage method and Euclidean distances. To quantify differences between average profiles of conditions, a multivariate Euclidean distance (with autoscale) was calculated between the apparently healthy and all other conditions.

The conditions (in the abscise axis) and the bins/metabolites (in the ordinate axis) have been sorted according to unsupervised cluster analysis. The bins have been assigned to the contributing metabolites and up to 17 different metabolites (and one unassigned bin) contribute to the discrimination of the conditions (Table 3 ). For the metabolites that are present in more than one bin, the most significant bin was used for the metabolite quantification. For each condition, the p-value indicates the statistical significance of the variation with respect to apparently healthy individuals (see asterisks inside the squares), while the fold change is colour-coded according to the bar legend: a red/blue value in the heatmap indicates up/down regulation of the bin. In most cases, all the bins that correspond to a given metabolite produce consistent fold changes, while the small differences observed in the magnitude of the fold change can be attributed to the metabolic heterogeneity of certain bins. Yet, citric acid shows upregulation at the 2.66 ppm bin and downregulation at the 2.57 ppm bin (Fig. 1B) . This is explained by the large sensitivity of citric acid to pH and osmolarity, that produces small changes in the chemical shift and the intensity of the (outer) bins vary accordingly (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ) [23] .",

            "text": "To further illustrate the relationship between the observed metabolic changes and MetS, in Fig. 1C we sketched a correlation map where adjacent conditions differing by only one RF are connected by lines and coloured by their Spearman's correlation distance to the apparently healthy condition (0000), as indicated. The graph shows once more that the variation of the urine metabolome (colors in Fig. 1C ) agrees well with MetS progression (raising number of RF = 1). Furthermore, the graph also reveals that not all the factors equally contribute to MetS progression; instead, for a given number We have also used the spectral database to create metabolic models of MetS (see Research Design and Methods for details) adapted to the different criteria used to define the MetS. To that end, we have first identified the number of cases with MetS condition, according to the different definitions, and using the general characteristics of the curated pool of 10,792 subjects. Only three out of the five different definitions from Table 1 can be truly distinguished with the general characteristics available in our cohort (here called independent definitions). Specifically, the MetS definition according to the WHO, EGIR and AACE are represented by the cluster of 1111, 1011, 1101 and 1110 conditions (squares and triangles in Fig. 1C) ; the MetS definition from NCEP:ATPIII and Harmonized are represented by the former conditions plus 0111 (squares, triangles and rhombus in Fig. 1C) , and the IDF MetS definition is represented by the 1111, 1101, 1110 and 0111 conditions (squares and rhombus in Fig. 1C ). Using these classifications, we found 642 cases for the NCEP:ATPIII or Harmonized definitions, 552 cases for the IDF definition and 494 cases for the WHO, EGIR or AACE definitions. Subsequently, we used the spectral information collected from the urine samples to train and test three metabolic models that maximizes the differences between the MetS and non-MetS conditions, one per independent definition and using 75% (8,094) /25% (2698) samples as training/validation cohorts. Figure 2A-C shows the ROC curves for the three models under consideration. Moreover, we have scrutinized the cohort, calculating its probability of undergoing MetS, for the three models/independent definitions (Fig. 2D-F) . Specifically, after applying each model, samples were scored with a \"MetS probability\" between 0 and 1. The figure represents the distribution of these scores as a smoothed histogram (kernel densities). These plots evidence that people without MetS tend to cluster together in the region of low scores while people with MetS tend to be spread mainly along high score regions, also reflecting the heterogeneity of the syndrome. The results show that the models, based solely on the metabolomic analysis of urine samples, can identify MetS, in excellent compliance with all three independent definitions, with AUROC values between 0.83 and 0.87. We believe that the discrepancies reflect the differences between our molecular [48] signature and the standard definitions for MetS. Indeed, while all independent definitions are largely consistent with our derived MetS metabotype, those including insulin resistance as mandatory criteria perform slightly better. This result is consistent with the statistical distance of the adiabetic 0111 condition that appears closer to the apparently healthy group than to full MetS (Fig. 1C) . This condition is included in the NCEP:ATPIII, IDF and Harmonized definitions. Finally, the heatmaps segregated by gender (Additional file 1: Figure S3 ) renders equivalent results than the one obtained for the entire cohort (Fig. 1B) , indicating that sex is not affecting the metabolic characterization of MetS. In turn, aging is a well-known risk factor for many diseases, including MetS [39] . The OSARTEN and OBENUTIC subcohorts are well-balanced in age while the PREDIMED cohort is older on average. A potential caveat is, therefore, that our metabolic model might partially monitor the aging process. To discard this pitfall, we also analysed an independent cohort (KIROLGETXO) that was not used in deriving our metabolic model and sampled a senior population (age between 60 and 85) with healthy lifestyle including regular sport activities.",

The OSARTEN cohort is large enough to represent most of the MetS conditions with sufficient statistical significance, despite being strongly biased towards the apparently healthy and more healthy conditions. Additional file 1: Figure S4 shows how the percentage of microalbuminuria increases as the condition approaches the full MetS condition (1111, at the right of the plot). This result suggests that microalbuminuria is related to MetS, as acknowledged by the WHO and consistent with previous reports relating hypertension and elevated proteinuria [40] .

Most of the RF defining MetS contribute to NAFLD progression and whether NAFLD is indeed the hepatic manifestation of NASH, as previously suggested [10] , remains an open question. We analysed a cohort of 234 urines from patients with NAFLD, diagnosed and staged by liver biopsy, the reference method for the characterization of the disease [42] . Based on the WHO, EGIR and AACE criteria, samples were classified in two subcohorts: NAFLD with MetS and NAFLD without MetS. We then used our metabolic model to predict the probability of MetS for the two subcohorts. Figure 3B shows the pertaining probability distributions for the general population (apparently healthy, 0000), the NAFLD without or with MetS subcohorts and the MetS population (with unknown status about NAFLD). As expected, the NAFLD without MetS subcohort indeed shows a low probability for having MetS on average, with a very similar distribution to the general population (also without MetS), implying that the NAFLD associated metabotype differs from the one for MetS. This result is consistent with the lack of association between transaminase levels and MetS patients [24] . In contrast, the NAFLD with MetS subcohort shows a complex probability distribution, highlighting the fact that a simultaneous presence of NAFLD and MetS confounds the metabolic definition for the syndrome, suggesting a partial overlap of associated metabotypes in line with their common risk factors. Taken together, our results suggest that MetS and NAFLD may be comorbidities with distinct metabolic profiles, albeit with some overlapping features.",

In here, we provide an unprecedented study using NMR spectroscopy and over a very large cohort of urine samples, specifically designed to populate all the possible intermediate conditions between healthy volunteers and MetS patients, the latter being characterized by the accumulation of RF and not biased by any specific definition of the syndrome. Remarkably, we always found a smooth but monotonic metabolic variation for a specific set of metabolites ( Fig. 4 and Table 3 ), well-reflecting the progressive deterioration of the metabolism due to the accumulation of RF towards MetS. Any case, not all these factors contribute equally to MetS progression, providing a molecular signature of the syndrome, as highlighted by the risk factors enclosed in the orange ellipse in Fig. 1C . This molecular definition of MetS (conditions 1001, 1011, 1101 and 1111) may be of particular interest in the discrimination of conditions that are in the interface between healthy individuals and MetS patients.",

Lowered histidine and imidazole levels could be linked to an impairment in the concentration of the endogenous ligands of the imidazoline and \u03b1 2 -adrenogenic receptor, ultimately associated to hypertension episodes [29, 30] . In turn, dyslypidemia, directly reflected in the elevated levels of lipids in urine [24, 25] and obesity, monitored by abnormal levels of TMAO, trigonelline and salicyluric acid, contribute to MetS but they would not constitute essential risk factors according to our molecular signature of MetS. Fig. 4 A molecular signature for MetS. All the risk factors that contribute to MetS have at least one metabolite in urine that is altered and contributes to the MetS metabotype. Such characteristic metabotype has been used to create a metabolic model to predict the probability of suffering MetS from the NMR analysis of a urine sample.

The target setting for our models was to compare our molecular definition of MetS with the current diagnostics for the syndrome (Table 1) , adding a molecular dimension to its definition. All existing definitions, based on slightly differing sets of risk factors, agree well with our derived metabolic profile, with high AUROC values for discrimination ranging between 0.85 and 0.92, performing better than a previously reported model [45] . Here, the WHO, EGIR, and AACE definitions including diabetes as a compulsory risk factor for MetS condition agree best with our predictions from urine metabotyping, presumably owing to the important weight of urinary glucose in the metabolic model. Actually, the AUROC values would raise up to 0.86-0.92 if hyperglycemia is defined as glucose higher than 110 mg/ dL (instead of 100 mg/dL, Additional file 1: Figure S6 ). Finally, our results also show a significant propensity for albuminuria in individuals with MetS, again in agreement with the WHO definition.",

B Heatmap for the different conditions as compared to the apparently healthy condition (0000). The conditions (in the abscise axis) and the bins/metabolites (in the ordinate axis) have been sorted according to cluster analysis. The relevant bins that contributed to the heatmap have been assigned to the corresponding metabolite, as indicated. The fold change is colour-coded according to the bar legend. For each condition, the statistical significance of the variation with respect to apparently healthy individuals is determined by the p-value, shown inside the squares. C Spearman correlation distances to the healthy condition for all the conditions. Colours represent the distance to the apparently healthy (0000) condition, as indicated in the legend. The lines connect adjacent conditions. MetS definition according to WHO, EGIR and AACE is represented by squares and triangles; definition from NCEP:ATPIII and Harmonized is represented by squares, triangles and rhombus; definition by IDF is represented by squares and rhombus. 4-HPPA: 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid; TMAO: trimethylamine N-oxide. The orange ellipse embraces all the conditions that would correspond to MetS according to our metabolic definition of accumulated RF, certain progression pathways are more pathogenic than others. This was used to generate a molecular signature of MetS (1111, 1101, 1011 & 1001; orange-highlighted inFig. 1C), that partially differs from the MetS definitions, based on symptom accumulation. For instance, the conditions 1110 and 0111 are both considered as MetS by many definitions, but they would fall in an intermediate position between MetS and an apparently healthy metabotype, according to our analysis. On the other hand, condition 1001 (with just hypertension and diabetes) is metabolically closer to MetS despite being generally considered as non-MetS.",
