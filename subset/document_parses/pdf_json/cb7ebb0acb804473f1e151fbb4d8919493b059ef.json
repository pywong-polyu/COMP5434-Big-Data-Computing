The sensitivity for mortality was 88% and the specificity was 42%. In terms of being non-responder to induction therapy, the sensitivity was 90,1%, the specificity was 25,3%.

The clear association of cell surface markers with prognosis constitutes an important area of study. In some studies, CD34 positivity has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis [6] . CD34 and HLA-DR........... coexistence were also found to be independent prognostic factors for induction failure [6] [7] [8] . Aberrant expression CD7 has been found to be positive prognostic indicator in AML [9] . New studies are needed in order to use all these different evaluation methods easily and effectively to predict the prognosis.

It has important findings in terms of combined [11] , it was aimed to examine the association of different immunophenotypic features with leukemia survival. In the analysis performed in 470 AML patients, it was revealed that CD7, CD19, CD20 and HLA-DR........... positivity had a negative effect on OS. In another study from 2015 [9] , flow cytometric immunophenotypic features were evaluated in a total of 142 patients with AML; CD7 expression has been shown to be a negative prognostic indicator. In this study, it was revealed that CD34 positivity is a positive prognostic marker. In another study [12] , a total of 209 patients with AML were evaluated and the association of flow cytometric immunophenotyping with relapse was investigated. CD34 positivity, HLA-DR........... positivity, or a combination of both have been shown to be associated with relapse. In addition to the controversial literature data on CD34 positivity, our study showed that, CD34 positivity had a significant negative effect only on the induction response and did not have any effect on mortality of the patients. The association of aberrant CD7 positivity with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) mutation and poor prognosis has also been demonstrated [13] . At this point, it should be emphasized that the use of immunophenotypic features in combination with clinical and genetic features gains importance rather than using them alone. Considering both the sensitivity of immunophenotyping and the number of patients in the studies, it would be more reliable to develop new risk scoring systems.",
