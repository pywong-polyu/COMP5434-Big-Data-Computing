Driven by powerful modern media, livestreaming, as a new form of attracting public attention to obtain economic benefits, is worth studying its influence path on consumers. Based on the technology acceptance model and the mediating effect of emotion, this study constructs the consumer influencing factor model of livestreaming e-commerce. The research model and related hypotheses are verified by SPSS and linear multiple regression models. The research found that emotional trust and perceived emotional value could be regarded as mediating variables to stimulate consumers' purchase intention in livestreaming e-commerce. They have a full mediating effect on product and atmosphere and a partial mediating effect on homogeneity and promotion, which identifies that online celebrity's homogeneity, and sales promotion could influence consumers' purchase intention through the partial mediating role of emotional trust and perceived emotional value, while product and atmosphere induced by emotional contagion could exert influence on consumers' purchase intention through the full mediating effect of emotional trust and perceived emotional value.",

            "text": "INTRODUCTION E-commerce live broadcast (livestreaming e-commerce) is a type of e-commerce in which live broadcast is used as a marketing channel (Kang et al., 2021; Xie C. et al., 2022) . It is the result of the two-way integration of live broadcast and e-commerce in the digital age (Wongkitrungrueng and Assarut, 2020; Zhou et al., 2021) . E-commerce live broadcast uses live broadcast to reconstruct the three elements of \"people, goods, and field, \" but its core is still e-commerce (Xue et al., 2020; Lu and Chen, 2021) . Compared with traditional e-commerce, e-commerce live broadcast has the advantages of high interaction and high conversion rate (Xu et al., 2021) . The live broadcast ecommerce industry chain is made up of the supply side, the platform side, and the consumers. The upstream supply side primarily consists of commodity suppliers (e.g., manufacturers, brands, distributors, and origin) (You, 2020) ; the midstream primarily consists of live broadcast service providers, channel platforms (e.g., e-commerce platforms, content platforms, and social platforms) (Liu et al., 2021) , and anchors (e.g., Internet celebrities, star artists, entrepreneurs, and other anchors); and the downstream demand side primarily consists of consumption (Maier and Wieringa, 2021) . In the traditional centralized ecommerce model, the platform is the center of transactions and communication between brands, merchants, and consumers, and it has tight control over flow, transaction data, and customer relationships (Yue et al., 2019; Varadarajan et al., 2021; Peruchi et al., 2022) . With the development of socialization, containerization, and decentralization of e-commerce, the platform's strong control over merchants and consumers has gradually eroded , allowing brands, merchants, and consumers to have direct contact with consumers and make sales conversion more efficient and cost-effective (Gielens and Steenkamp, 2019; Wedel et al., 2020) . From flow acquisition to conversion operations, the value of private domain flow is increasing.",

On the one hand, the centralized e-commerce platform began to receive external flow through technical cooperation, investment and acquisition, and so on (Cui et al., 2017; Malacina et al., 2022) ; on the other hand, the platform's flow control has tightened further, causing more flow to be concentrated on head companies and clearing out mid-and long-tail merchants (Chiu and Wong, 2021; Gao et al., 2022) . Under these conditions, the combination of small-and medium-sized businesses and private domain flow becomes even more important (Jun et al., 2020) . When the flow is plentiful, a significant amount of free or low-cost public domain flow can be converted into private domain flow of brands and merchants, with the private domain flow of merchants being deposited on the platform and becoming the platform's public domain flow (Xie X. et al., 2022) . When the flow dividend falls, however, the platform's demand for public domain flow control and monetization rises, amplifying the conflict between public and private domain flow (Fu et al., 2022) . Second, private domains are not a brandnew idea. Address books and emails were all examples of private domain flow before social networking became popular (Cozzolino et al., 2021) . The connotation of private domain flow has been further extended with the emergence of social platforms, such as WeChat and Weibo.",

Importing users into their own platforms is the only way to achieve controllable private domain flow (e.g., independent app, WeChat group, official account, personal account, and corporate WeChat). Brand merchants, on the other hand, must pay for public domain flow pool exposure, which will continue to rise in price (Wong and Ngai, 2021; Zheng et al., 2022) . In contrast, while merchants must also operate and maintain private domain flow, the cost of acquiring customers is relatively low and long term (Peck et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2017) . Finally, as more people become aware, brands and merchants will be able to establish private domain flow pools, allowing them to expand their business.

Although there are many literatures on emotional marketing and livestreaming e-commerce, this study is the first to use emotional trust and perceived emotional value as mediating variables to study the effect of emotion on consumers' purchase intention in livestreaming e-commerce. In addition, although there are many literatures on opinion leader, marketing mix, and emotional contagion previously, this study is the first to take the characteristics of online opinion leaders, product and promotion, as well as atmosphere induced by emotional contagion as independent variables, plus emotional trust and perceived emotional value as intermediary variables, to study how these variables influence consumers' purchase intention through the mediating effect of emotion in livestreaming e-commerce.",

Network anchors, unlike traditional opinion leaders, regularly release selfcreated topics on social media or e-commerce platforms via network live broadcasts, videos, photos, blogs, and other means to influence their followers (Mcquarrie et al., 2013; Khamis et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018) .

Online reviews from reputable or well-known participants have a significant impact on product sales (Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006) .

Consumers' purchase intentions can be influenced by popularity by increasing their emotional trust in anchors (Huffaker, 2010; Edwards et al., 2013) . Emotional trust can alleviate hesitancy and expedite the purchasing decision-making process . Furthermore, the greater the influencer's popularity, the more consumers believe that the products recommended by the influencer have perceived emotional value, resulting in increased purchase intent . In terms of social media, Kowalczyk and Pounders (2016) reported a positive and significant impact of emotional trust and emotional value to the popularity of traditional celebrities on the likelihood of brand purchase.

Consumers tend to imitate Internet celebrities whose values are comparable with their own and purchase the goods they use and recommend (Dittmar et al., 1996) . Hence, homogeneous Internet celebrities can directly influence consumers' purchase intention. In addition, Internet celebrities share personal thoughts about products and life, and the presentations seem casual and very real to the audience (Golbeck, 2016) . They interact with their followers by liking, commenting, sharing, and retweeting, so users feel that they have a psychological closeness to the online celebrity. Although proximity and reciprocal exchange/relationships are \"fictional\" (or illusionary) social relationships, consumers are more likely to place emotional trust and emotional value on them. The frequency of live broadcasts, the duration of the live broadcasts, and the viewers' memories (i.e., recall of these exchanges and experiences) reinforce these emotional trust and emotional value. Hence, homogeneity can stimulate consumers' purchase intention through increasing their emotional trust and perceived emotional value (L\u00f3pez et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2021) .

Furthermore, among consumers who do not interact directly, the emotions of other consumers will influence the emotions and purchase intentions of consumers (Chuah and Yu, 2021) . As more conversations and tasks take place in virtual environments, such as e-commerce platforms, emotional contagion can occur without a physical location (in many cases, only through textbased interactions) (Meng et al., 2021) . Emotions, according to the existing research, can spread virtually between individuals or groups, as well as more broadly via social networking platforms (Peck et al., 2013; Kramer et al., 2014; Del Vicario et al., 2016; Chuah and Yu, 2021; Soderlund et al., 2021) . In addition, emotion around the environment could stimulate emotional trust and perceived emotional value, thus stimulating consumers' purchase intention (Pornpitakpan, 2004; Wen et al., 2009; Munasinghe et al., 2019) . Therefore, consumers' purchase intention may be influenced by the atmosphere around the live studio on consumers' perceived emotional value and emotional trust. Thus, hypothesis 3 is proposed.",

Statistically, a KMO value >0.6 is considered suitable for factor analysis. According to Table 3 , all KMO values are >0.6, indicating that all items can perform factor analysis. After factor analysis, the scale was discovered to have eight main factors.

Table 5 shows that 111 men account for 27.75% of the total, while 289 women account for 72.25%, confirming that women prefer to buy cosmetics over men. When asked if they had purchased cosmetics via live broadcast, 283 people said yes (70.75%) and 117 people said no (29.25%), indicating that purchasing cosmetics via livestreaming e-commerce has become a popular trend. Cosmetics manufacturers should take advantage of this new channel to increase cosmetics sales. The most common age group, which accounts for 67.5% of the population, is 18-30 years. The second age group, comprising 22.25% of the population, is between the ages of 30 and 45 years. This suggests that young women are most likely to buy cosmetics and most willing to try new things, such as live broadcasting. The highest income levels are 2,000-4,000 yuan and 4,000-6,000 yuan, which are comparable with average wages in China. As a result, cosmetics manufacturers can target a large number of potential customers with a moderate income, and they can create cost-effective cosmetics for them. Undergraduate and college education have the highest rates of completion, with 54.25 and 26.5%, respectively. The sample group is generally well-educated, and they should have a thorough understanding of live broadcast marketing, which will help them complete the second section of the questionnaire. When it comes to occupation, civil servants and private employees have a higher proportion, consistent with their income level. Their purchase intention can also represent plenty of people. ",

These studies verified that product and promotion could stimulate consumers' purchase intention but did not study the relation between product or promotion and emotion. Some researchers identified the relation between promotion and emotion. Promotion could directly affect consumers' purchase intention and indirectly exert influence through the mediating role of positive emotion (Andani and Wahyono, 2018) . Different promotions could induce different emotional perceptions, and it can be a negative emotion, such as the sense of embarrassment or impatience (Yang and Lee, 2016) . In short, promotion can stimulate buying through inducing emotions. Aydinli et al. (2014) pointed out that promotion could stimulate emotion, thus influencing purchase decision, which systematically expounded that promotion enhances the role of emotion and reduces the role of reason, but did not make product and promotion as independent variables and emotional trust and perceived emotional value as intervening variables to study how they use the effect of emotion to influence consumers' purchase intention in livestreaming e-commerce. This study fills the research blank and verifies that the influence of product and promotion can be exerted on consumers' purchase intention directly or based on the intermediating variables-emotional trust and perceived emotional value.",

Actually, there are few literatures on the theory of emotional contagion in the field of marketing, and the latest research verifies the impact of online celebrity in livestreaming e-commerce on purchase intention from the perspective of emotional contagion (Meng et al., 2021) but it only studies the influence of specific emotional types of Internet celebrities and other audiences on consumers' purchase intention.

The literature on emotional marketing has been listed in the part of literature review, which shows the research results on emotion in consumer behavior. Livestreaming e-commerce is a novel model of e-commerce, and current studies focus on the role of emotion in livestreaming e-commerce. Lin et al. (2021) examined the role of emotion in interactive and dynamic business settings, such as livestreaming, and identified emotional communication and influence between broadcasters and viewers. Meng et al. (2021) explored the impact of online celebrity in livestreaming e-commerce on purchase intention from the perspective of emotional contagion. Bharadwaj et al. (2022) assessed the sales impact of emotional displays of broadcasters based on a new livestream retail analytics framework. These researchers have studied the role of emotion in the livestream but do not study the mediating effect of emotion and how other factors besides broadcasters affect consumers' purchase intention through emotion. Furthermore, even if the emotional communication between broadcasters and audiences is studied, how the personal characteristics of broadcasters affect consumers' purchase intention through emotion is not studied. These are the research blanks. Therefore, this study is the first to use emotional trust and perceived emotional value as mediating variables to study the effect of emotion on consumers' purchase intention in livestreaming e-commerce. In addition, this study is the first to take the characteristics of online opinion leaders, product and promotion, as well as atmosphere induced by emotional contagion as independent variables, plus emotional trust and perceived emotional value as intermediary variables, to study how these variables influence consumers' purchase intention through the effect of emotions in livestreaming e-commerce.",

Finally, we have only studied the influence of positive emotion on consumers' purchasing behavior, and have ignored the role of negative emotion, such as fear, anger, sadness, and so forth. Previous studies on emotions have found that negative emotion may influence consumers' participation in compensatory purchases, and subsequent studies could further explore the mediating effects of negative emotion during livestreams.",
