This study used a descriptive statistic to summarize the knowledge and preventive practices of hypertensive or diabetic patients towards the coronavirus pandemic. The data were collected using a pre-tested, structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, and preventive practices towards COVID-19. The questions assessing knowledge (14 questions) were answered on a correct/not correct basis. A correct answer was assigned 1 point and an incorrect/unknown answer was assigned 0 points. The total knowledge score ranged from 0 to 14. Participants' overall knowledge was categorized. Therefore, we used the cut-off point as 'poor' if the score was less than 60% (< 8 of 14 points) and 'good' if the score was above 60% (> 8 of 14 points). Similarly, the questions assessing practice (9 questions) were answered 'yes' or 'no', the correct answer was assigned 1 point and an incorrect answer was assigned 0 points. The overall preventive practice score was categorized using the same parameter. If the overall score for preventive practice is less than 60% (<7 of 9 points) is 'poor' and 'good' if the score is more than 60% (> 7 of 9 points). The preventive practice component consists of questions about: frequently washed hands with water and soap, stopped shaking hands while giving a greeting, avoided proximity including while greeting (within 2 meters), have not been gone to a crowded place, using a face mask when leaving home, avoided touching eye, nose, mouth before washing hands, used cover/elbow during coughing/sneezing, used sanitizer (alcohol-rubbing, no contact with surfaces), and have stayed at home.",

The 'international poverty line ' is currently set at $1.90 a day at international prices. We computed the income variable by multiplying $1.90 by the current exchange rate (Ethiopian Birr currency).

There was a significant gap between knowledge and preventive practices towards the pandemic among the study subjects. For instance, the knowledge of wearing medical masks to prevent infection was 92%, but the practice of wearing medical masks was only 63.9%. Knowledge of avoiding going to crowded places was 94.4%, whereas the practice of going to crowded places was 74.5%. This finding is consistent with studies conducted in Ethiopia [18, 30] . However, this result is inconsistent with studies conducted in India and Bangladesh, in which above 90% of the study subjects avoided crowded places and wore face masks when leaving home during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak [38, 39] . This discrepancy may be due to socio-cultural and behavioral differences. Ethiopia is known for its diversity, social, cultural, religious ceremonies, and a high rate of overcrowded living conditions. Moreover, financial, cultural, and religious norms are the main barriers to preventive practices of COVID-19 that affect the acceptability of public health measures [40, 41] . In this study, the high practice of going to crowded places during the pandemic is attributed to the strong cultural and religious norms. These norms are the restricting factors of preventive practices of COVID-19. In Ethiopian culture, practicing social gatherings during the occurrence of vital events is common. All rituals, including mourning, marriage, and other social and religious gatherings are long-lasting practices persisting in the era of COVID 19. This compromises the acceptance of the public health measures by the community which further challenges the effective implementation of the measures against the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Knowledge of COVID-19 was found to be an independent predictor of preventive practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at mobilizing and improving COVID-19-related knowledge and practices are highly recommended for these patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Concerning the preventive practices, great emphasis should be given to specific preventive practices such as frequent handwashing with soap and water, avoiding going to crowded places (social distancing), and using face masks while leaving home. These major preventive practices have to be adopted to prevent the contraction of the virus. Furthermore, for fear of acquiring the disease from health facilities, a significant number of patients with hypertension or diabetes interrupted their medical follow-up. Back tracing of those patients at a community level, continuing to follow up, a priority of testing, and vaccinations against COVID-19 at home level is highly recommended for patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus.
