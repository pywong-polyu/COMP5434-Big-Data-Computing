Anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies were determined using both a quantitative and a semi-quantitative assay. For a qualitative assessment of the humoral immune response, we additionally measured neutralizing antibodies. Cellular immune response was evaluated by measuring Interferon-gamma release after stimulating blood-cells with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides using a commercial assay.",

In addition to the reduced antibody response after vaccination older people are known to have a faster decrease after vaccination (4) . Interestingly, obese participants with a BMI higher than 30 showed a significantly higher decrease in the antibody ratio and also significantly lower neutralizing antibodies not only in the univariate analysis but also following the regression analysis. This effect was first described by Watanabe et al. (17) and seen by Malavazos et al. (18) in the first months after vaccination.",
