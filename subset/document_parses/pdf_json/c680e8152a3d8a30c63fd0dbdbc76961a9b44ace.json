DCT appeared equivalent to self-isolation in terms of transmission in the trial, however it was not clear how tests were viewed and used in practice. In this qualitative study, we used a nested process to aid interpretation of the trial and provide insight into factors influencing use of tests, understanding of test results, and how tests were used to inform behavioural decisions.",

In the Autumn of 2020, mass testing pilot schemes were introduced so that members of the public could take a test even if they did not have symptoms of COVID-19 [1, 2] . By April 2021, members of the public were encouraged to get tested with a LFT twice weekly [3, 4] so that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections could be identified. Those testing positive for COVID-19 were required to take a confirmatory PCR test and self-isolate for 10 days. Close contacts of the positive case were also required to self-isolate at home for 10 days. Although self-isolation is an effective strategy for reducing the spread of COVID-19, it can have a substantial and negative impact on the individual and society [5, 6] . Self-isolation following close contact remains a requirement for adult contacts who are not fully vaccinated.",

Previous research has suggested DCT may be a feasible alternative to self-isolation [10] [11] [12] [13] , and may be as effective as selfisolation for controlling transmission in certain situations [14] . However, earlier studies were either conducted while stringent society-wide restrictions were in force, and familiarity with testing was low [11, 12] , or within specific settings, such as schools [14] . Research is needed to understand how the general public view and use testing as an alternative to self-isolation in a context in which many government imposed restrictions have eased and familiarity with testing has increased.",

The primary aim was to compare the effect on infection transmission of seven days of DCT as an alternative to 10 days of standard self-isolation following close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. Participants randomised to DCT (DCT group) had the option to take a lateral flow test for seven consecutive days and were granted freedom from self-isolation for a 24hour period on receipt of a negative test result.

These issues may affect how people use LFTs and limit their willingness to use the freedoms that the system allows. Therefore, a secondary aim of the trial was to use a mixed methods approach to examine the acceptability and feasibility of DCT as an alternative to self-isolation, and behaviour during the testing period. This aim was achieved by means of a survey of 20,004 (40% response rate) participants who completed the trial, and in-depth one to one interviews. The survey analysis (reported elsewhere [15] ) compared those who were DCT and only reported negative tests (DCT negative test) to those who reported at least one positive test (DCT positive test) and those who completed standard self-isolation (SI), and found that most participants, regardless of group allocation, reported modifying their behaviour during the study period. Among those who were supposed to be isolating (i.e., those in the In the SI and the DCT positive test group) approximately 4 out of 5 people reported much less contact with non-household contacts during the study period. Among those who were not required to isolate, 3 out of 5 people reported much less contact. Only a small number of participants reported that they had left the home whilst self-isolating; approximately 1 in 6 in each group. However, the most common reason for leaving the home whilst isolating was to take a COVID-19 test. The survey also indicated that participants were confident in All rights reserved.

Tests were often interpreted in combination with other indicators, such as presence or absence of symptoms, likelihood of contact with the positive case, or vaccination status. In some cases, participants attempted to increase accuracy through repeated use of LFT or PCR tests. However, whilst LFTs were often viewed as preferable to no tests, it was noted by participants that they should be used cautiously in combination with reduced contact and increased infection control behaviours as much as possible.",
