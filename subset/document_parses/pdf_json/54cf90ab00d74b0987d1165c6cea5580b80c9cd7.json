Degradation of a specific component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) affects the physical barrier of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and induces metastasis. Here, lysolipid-containing thermosensitive liposomes (LTSLs) were prepared to deliver an MMP inhibitor, marimastat (MATT), to the TME to inhibit MMP activity and expression. LTSLs rapidly released their payloads at 42\u00b0C. Compared with the saline control, MATT-LTSLs exhibited enhanced accumulation in the tumor and a 20-fold decrease in tumor growth in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice; moreover, MATT-LTSLs reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity by 50% and 43%, respectively, and downregulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in vivo by 30% and 43%, respectively. Most importantly, MATT-LTSL treatment caused a 7-fold decrease in metastatic lung nodules and a 6-fold reduction in microvessels inside the tumor. We believe this study provides an effective approach for the suppression of metastasis, and the use of a cytotoxic agent in combination with MATT is a potential strategy for metastatic cancer treatment.",

MATT inhibits MMPs with high efficiency and exhibits over 50% MMP inhibition in a nanomolar range. 10 In particular, the IC 50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values to inhibit MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, and MMP-14 are 5, 6, 16, 3 and 9 nM, respectively. Indeed, MATT is able to inhibit tumor growth and was a candidate chemotherapeutic agent; however, a clinical study indicated that MATT was no better than placebo at prolonging survival in gastric cancer patients. 11 Nonetheless, it has been reported that MATT is a promising maintenance treatment following chemotherapy. 12 Based on the robust inhibitory effect of MATT on MMPs, it is hypothesized that if MATT is efficiently delivered to the TME, this inhibition will enable the maintenance of the TME physical barrier and the resultant suppression of cancer metastasis, as well as angiogenesis.",

[19] [20] [21] In this study, LTSLs were prepared for local delivery of MATT to the TME, with the aim of inhibiting breast cancer metastasis. To obtain proof of the concept, various experiments, including western blotting, gelatin zymography, determination of angiogenesis, and lung metastasis, were carried out. Significantly, LTSLs delivered MATT to the TME with high efficiency and suppressed lung metastasis and angiogenesis in 4T1-bearing mice, as well as inhibiting MMPs. Compared with the inhibition of tumor growth, MATT, particularly MATT-LTSLs, was more efficient at inhibiting angiogenesis and metastasis. We believe that this finding provides a novel strategy for adjuvant chemotherapy for metastatic cancer.",

LTSLs without payload generated little toxicity to 4T1 and MDA-MB-435 cells, even at high concentrations of lipids ( Supplementary Fig. S1c ). The effect of the drug-loading formulations, free MATT and MATT-LTSLs, on cytotoxicity in 4T1 and MDA-MB-435 cells is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1a , b. Free MATT showed minimal toxicity against these two cell lines, despite the concentration difference. Additionally, MATT-LTSLs did not affect the viability at MATT concentrations <10 \u00b5g/mL for MDA-MB-435 cells and 5 \u00b5g/mL for 4T1 cells; however, at higher concentrations of 50 \u00b5g/mL, MATT-LTSLs were toxic to these cell lines, with cell viability <35% and 15% for 4T1 cells and MDA-MB-435 cells, respectively. Additionally, hyperthermia (HT) treatment at 42\u00b0C did not influence the cytotoxicity. MMPs, particularly MT1-MMP, are multifunctional proteases that regulate ECM degradation, pro-MMP-2 activation, and viability; importantly, the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP is required for cell survival. 24 Here, the improved uptake of MATT by LTSLs might result in increased In vitro inhibition of MMPs The in vitro expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in 4T1 cells was assayed by western blot and gelatin zymography after incubation with MATT-LTSLs for 12 h followed by mild HT treatment at 42\u00b0C or not. The western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of MMPs in cells treated with MATT-LTSLs and MATT-LTSLs + HT was significantly downregulated compared with that of cells treated with saline and free MATT (Fig. 2a, d, e) . A further comparison revealed that the MMP expression in MATT-LTSL-treated cells was lower than that of MATT-LTSL + HT-treated cells.",

Treatment with MATT-LTSLs or MATT-LTSLs + HT decreased the area and brightness of the bands more significantly compared to treatment with free MATT (Fig. 2b, c) . Again, MATT-LTSLs exhibited a more profound reduction in MMP activity than MATT-LTSLs + HT. Generally, MMPs in the TME are synthesized and secreted by tumor cells; thus, the in vitro inhibition of MMP expression and activity is effectively reduced by the improved cellular uptake of the MMPI, MATT, via MATT-LTSLs. Collectively, our results indicate that both MATT-LTSLs and MATT-LTSLs + HT are capable of decreasing the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in 4T1 cells, with the former showing enhanced inhibition.",

Nonetheless, due to MATT's low cytotoxicity against cancer cells ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), its antitumor activity, even when efficiently delivered to the tumor, is modest compared with that of a robust cytotoxic agent such as paclitaxel. 30 LTSLs efficiently deliver MATT to the tumor location and enhance the in vivo inhibition of MMPs. Gelatin zymography and western blot analysis showed that compared with free MATT, MATT-LTSLs significantly enhanced the inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity and expression. These results stem from the tumor-targeting ability of LTSLs, showing that LTSLs not only were able to accumulate in tumors but also were able to penetrate the tumors (Fig. 3) . Subsequently, the penetrated LTSLs rapidly released their payloads within the microvessels inside the tumor induced by local HT treatment of the tumors, resulting in the increased localization of the payload in the entire tumor. 20 Indeed, the temperature sensitivity of the LTSLs was confirmed by the in vitro release test.",

            "text": "Compared with its ability to inhibit tumor growth, MATT is a more potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and metastasis, and importantly, these effects are markedly enhanced when LTSLs are used as MATT carriers. Since the discovery of MATT, a considerable number of studies have focused on its antitumor efficacy regarding the inhibition of tumor growth rather than its suppression of cancer metastasis and angiogenesis. Essentially, the main function of MATT is to inhibit the MMPs in the TME Fig. 4 In vivo antitumor efficacy in 4T1 tumor-bearing Balb/C mice. Free MATT, MATT-LTSLs, and the same volume of saline were injected via the tail vein every 3 days at a MATT dose of 5 mg/kg. a Tumor volume fold change. b Body weight changes. c Tumor weight. The tumor was weighed on day 19 post injection (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 6, *p < 0.05) instead of killing cancer cells directly, assisting the maintenance of the physical barrier of the TME and reducing the metastasis. Here, MATT-LTSLs enabled a 7-fold decrease in the number of metastatic nodules in the lung and a 6-fold reduction in the number of microvessels inside the tumor, which implies profound antimetastatic and antiangiogenic effects. Additionally, free MATT exhibited a 3-fold and 1-fold decrease in metastasis and angiogenesis. These results also demonstrate that only MATT is efficiently delivered to the TME. These two inhibitory effects are greatly enhanced because LTSLs deliver MATT directly to the tumor and subsequently inhibit MMP activity and expression, prevent ECM degradation, and protect the TME from destruction, ultimately restricting the cancer cells to the TME. Once metastasis has been established, chemotherapy always fails to induce a durable response, ultimately resulting in cancer patient death. 27 Therefore, our study provides a competent strategy for inhibiting metastasis. Undeniably, the use of MATT-LTSLs alone is not efficient in killing cancer cells due to MATT's low toxicity to cells; consequently, the combined use of a cytotoxic agent such as paclitaxel with MATT is a promising treatment approach for metastatic cancer. Further study is currently underway.",

All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the protocol approved by the China Pharmaceutical University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. First, 4T1 cells suspended at a density of 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells/ mL were injected into the upper dorsal region of Balb/C mice (females, 18-20 g) subcutaneously in a volume of 0.1 mL for each mouse. When the tumor volume reached 500 mm 3 , free DiR and DiR-LTSLs were injected into the tumor-bearing mice via the tail vein at a fixed DiR dose of 0.5 mg/kg. At 1, 2, 4, 7, 12, and 24 h post injection, the treated mice were anesthetized with isoflurane to detect DiR fluorescence using an In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS Spectrum, Perkin-Elmer, USA). At 7, 12, and 24 h post injection, the mice were sacrificed to collect the major tissues for ex vivo fluorescence imaging.",
