It highlights longstanding social-political constructs that define how our institutions value marginalized and minoritized patients, and the communities where they live, play, work, and die. The epidemic emphasizes the urgency for strategic, equitable investments in our public health infrastructure. It calls for a bold reimagining of the policies and practices, which determine the medical tradition, and the direction in which our healthcare system is shifting. In the wake of this shift, providers are presented with newer, more complex questions, which stretch beyond the traditional realms of American medicine. How do we reimagine our US health system, redistribute resources and opportunities, and reflect on the social and economic tolls of worldwide crises? Beyond the traditional healthcare continuum, what will it take to prevent avoidable deaths and injuries, and what will it take to strategically strive toward a more equitable existence? While there are many factors at play, address-ing these questions necessitates evaluating policies that govern the American healthcare system and its actors. It takes re-envisioning political determinants of health and health spheres [4] . It will take intentional creation of policies and practices within advocacy arenas that move the needle toward equity, antiracism, and health in all policies [5] [6] . Foremost, such work takes an unquestionable recognition of racism-and its caustic associates of other \"isms\"-as a public health threat [7] [8] [9] .",

There was no straightforward path to reach this point, nor even will the records show uncontested consensus amongst the more than 600 HOD voting Delegates on the way to passage of these policies. Indeed, prioritizing equity is an outcome of political will as well as democracy. Through this policies-building process, collaboration and strategic coordination prevailed between the AMA HOD Medical Students Section (MSS), the Minority Affairs Section (MAS), the Women Physicians Section, and countless allies within the AMA Board of Trustees, Councils, senior management, and across the AMA staff, particularly from the AMA Center for Health Equity. The voices of current and future physicians with intersectional identities are stronger than ever. Many whom are HOD Delegates were moved by the 2020 murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd-such conviction was particularly reflected in their staunch testimonials in support of the November 2020 policies. Through these policies, the American Medical Association cements its core commitment to advancing health equity, particularly in medical education, healthcare delivery, research, and practice.",

It then segues into descriptions of the intent of three HOD November 2020 antiracism policies, specifically. While there were other significant policies also passed alongside the three highlighted policies, this paper will only comment on how they bolster the power of the antiracism HOD policies, leaving opportunity for future, more in-depth conversation. The authors then describe the arc of AMA leadership and several critical events over time-some of which have been deeply harmful to marginalized and minoritized communities, and unhelpful toward advancing equity for all-that led to the approval of the HOD triad antiracism policies. The perspective concludes on a hopeful note that such work is only the beginning of the AMA's commitment to achieving health equity in the 21 st century.",

The Commission was an appointed joint body of physicians between the AMA, the National Medical Association (NMA), and the National Hispanic Medical Association (NHMA). Its collective purpose was to (1) influence government actions so as to curtail disparities in healthcare; (2) engage health professionals and organizations in efforts to eliminate disparities; (3) improve the practice environment to foster effective efforts to eliminate disparities; (4) increase the diversity of the health professional workforce; and (5) promote collaboration between medicine and private industry on strategies to eliminate disparities [20] . In 2008, the AMA issued a public apology to the NMA-the largest organized body of Black physicians established in 1895 in response to barred AMA membership through the 1960's-for its explicit role in stymieing the professional development of the Black physician workforce, and therefore the consequent dearth of medical professionals available to treat Black and Brown residents of the United States [21] [22] [23] . Current-day research cites the lack of a representative health workforce as a persisting barrier to availing quality care to marginalized and minoritized communities, and to the downstream causes of health inequities along racial lines [24] .",

In unprecedented fashion, and on his first day in office, President Biden signed four executive orders to advance racial equity, veritably beginning a new era of American leadership [27] . As the advocating voice of the physician, the AMA's attention to administrative actions is unwavering and the Presidential commitment to equity speaks volumes to the AMA. The three AMA HOD antiracist policies harken not only to an awakening at the change of medical leadership-it is also in lockstep with national leadership, and positions the AMA to openly support Congressional, Federal, and state level antiracist policies: the AMA cannot otherwise support policies at these levels if it does not already have similar, existing HOD policy.",

As a bastion of healthcare advocacy and policy, the AMA is continuously heralded within political spaces: its leaders are consistently called upon by Congress to deliver testimony at hearings, to respond to health policies of great import, and its lobbying force is bar none. This power is profound, and now profoundly rooted in accountability to advance equitable, anti-racist commitments. Given that race, albeit a social construct, is imbued across every American institution, it follows that antiracist and equitable policies are necessary to reimagine and restructure the role of race on health outcomes, and, more broadly, on life opportunity [8] . The mark of these three outlined policies is indelible. In time, it will become exceedingly clear the path they have produced with respect to the policies that AMA will continue to pass within the HOD, as well as the policies it will critically evaluate and support, whether Congressionally via the AMA Advocacy Business Unit, or locally via the state medical societies.",
