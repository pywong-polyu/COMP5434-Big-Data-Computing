In this respect, appropriate preventative and control measures in order to eliminate or reduce the negative effects of surface-transmitted infections appear highly desirable. Alongside recommendations for treatment and hygiene, antimicrobial material surfaces can offer indeed an important contribution to the prevention of infections. The aim of the current paper is therefore to describe the preparation and characterization of a new material obtained by an innovative anodic oxidation, defined as golden hard anodizing GHA. The anodic oxide surface thanks to the nanoporous structure acts as reservoir of silver ions (Ag + ) which in turn confer antimicrobial properties to the material surface. Specifically, the manuscript presents a thorough preparation and characterization of a new material obtained by an innovative anodic oxidation treatment applied on commercially available aluminum alloys including the microscopic analysis and the description of the antimicrobial performances against a number of microorganisms, including among the others, Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. More specifically, the current article describes some of the properties of GHA materials. The tribological properties of GHA were evaluated through experimental tests performed with a pin-on-disk tribometer. The morphology of the wear surfaces was studied by means of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis and profilometry investigations. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the possible anticorrosive properties of GHA, tests in neutral salt spray are in addition described.",

The GHA disk samples (75 mm in diameter, 4 mm thickness) were tested by a non-contact 3D optical profilometer, using a green light and 20\u00d7 objective CCI-Lite Talysurf (Taylor Hobson, Leicester, UK). In each disk, 4 independent rectangular areas (20.04 mm \u00d7 0.83 mm) where identified for the profilometric analysis, each of them represented by a rectangle, measuring 20.04 \u00d7 0.83 mm. The analysis was performed by the software MountainsMap 7 (Digital Surf, Besancon, France) using the following operators: original reference image, spatial filter, fill in non-measured point filter, form removal filter, 3-D surface reconstruction of the analyzed area and extracted profile. Before the analysis, each sample has been cleaned with ethyl alcohol to remove any traces of surface dirt. The centre of each disk has been identified and marked so that it can be positioned under the profilometer light in the same point before and after the wear tests. For each disk, starting from the center, 4 roughness measurements were carried out. The surface topography was quantified by obtaining different geometric descriptors. Specifically, the roughness was expressed by the following parameters: Rz, Ra, Rq, Rsk, and Rku, where Rz is the maximum height of the profile, defined on the sampling length; Ra is the arithmetic mean deviation of the assessed profile, defined on the sampling length; Rq is the root mean square deviation of the assessed profile, it corresponds to the standard deviation of the height distribution, defined on the sampling length; Rsk is the skewness of the assessed profile, it represents the asymmetry of the height distribution, defined on the sampling length. The Rsk parameter is particularly important as it gives information on the morphology of the surface texture. Positive values correspond to high peaks spread on a regular surface (distribution skewed towards bottom) while negative values are found on surfaces with pores and scratches. Rku is the kurtosis of the assessed profile, representing the sharpness of the height distribution, defined on the sampling length; specifically, a surface with perfectly random height distribution has Rku equal to 3. For surfaces with few high peaks and low valleys, Rku is less than 3, while for surfaces with many high peaks and low valleys, Rku is greater than 3.",

The microscopic analysis was performed using a EVO40 SEM (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germania) equipped with a LaB6 thermionic source with an electron acceleration voltage (EHT) equal to 20,000 kV. With respect to the SEM, sample preparation and analysis were performed by the following procedure. The micrographs were recorded in secondary electron imaging (SEI-SEM) and back-scattered electron (BSE-SEM) mode, with an electron acceleration voltage (EHT) equal to 20 kV. Secondary electrons provided the topographic contrast, while backscattered electrons provided the compositional contrast. After the wear tests, each disk was carefully cleaned with acetone to remove wear debris and dust from the wear track. The cleaned disk was transferred onto a stub, secured with a carbon adhesive tape. Since the anodic oxide is a nonconducting treatment, the examination of the disks was undertaken in low vacuum SEM mode to reduce the electric charge due to impingement of the electron beam at their surfaces. Given that the nonconducting treatment is unable to discharge the negative charge, the air is injected into the specimen chamber around the specimen surface area. This allows for charge-free imaging of nonconductive specimens without having to coat them with a conductive material. Through the microanalytical technique of energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), it was possible to make maps of the elements present on the worn surface. X-ray mapping shows the elemental distribution in a two-dimensional plot: maps for all detected elements are displayed through multiple windows, which show the scanned area. The regions that appear bright are the regions where the considered element is concentrated. As a result, elements present in a sample are coloured maps of estimates of elements.",

Formation of barrier oxide on the entire area (a); local field distributions caused by surface fluctuations (b); formation of pores by electrolytic dissolution (c); pore growth (d); pore filling by Ag+ ions (e) and finally sealing process by hot water treatment (f) the apparatus for the electrochemical treatment includes a rectangular electrolytic tank, in which the electrodes are placed on both sides and connected in parallel. Each of the electrodes is composed, in turn, of four smaller units (constituted of carbon steel) and connected in series at regular intervals along the longitudinal direction. The samples to be treated (e.g., the aluminum alloy) are arranged between electrodes and immersed in the electrolyte (based on sulfuric acid) to which a silver salt is later added. The electrochemical treatment is based on the application of a combination of an alternating current and a positive direct current. As shown in the scheme (upper part of Fig. 1) , the positive pole of the DC source is connected to a reactor while the negative pole is connected to the electrodes. The reactor is also connected to an AC source, in this way there is a combination of currents which are supplied to the samples. As schematized in the lower part of Fig. 1 , the initial part of the process is characterized by the formation of a thin oxide compact layer of Al 2 O 3 (A), later the process involves the increase of the oxide thickness (B) and the initial pore formation (C); in a further phase the dimension of the pore (diameter and depth) continue to grow (D). The pores, formed in the oxide layer, start to be filled with Ag + ions (present in the electrolytic bath) (E), finally the silver containing pores are sealed by treatment with hot water (F). N0tably, the layers formed by the electrochemical process are made up of a mixture of alumina and hydrated alumina, and are, as stated, highly porous. Pores are typically 200-350 nm in size and are oriented perpendicularly to the metal surface.",

In operation, an anodized component that corrodes will wear prematurely and, if it wears prematurely, it will tend to corrode more easily. Therefore, in the current paper, the tribological tests were performed in conditions of real use, therefore considering only sealed pore surface specimens. As previously discussed, the roughness of the discs was measured before the wear tests. Pin on disk tests were conducted using a specific set up as depicted in Fig. 5 constituted of a sample holder (diameter 165 mm), with a central cavity for the GHA sample in form of a disk (diameter 75 mm) and a stationary counter body represented by the 100Cr6 steel ball (diameter 10 mm). Therefore, given the different curvature of the surface of the disc and the end of the pin, the two bodies have, ideally, only one point of contact. In particular, the contact area is characterized by a first elastic (Hertzian) and then plastic contact analysis.",

However, it should be considered that the Hertzian stresses and pressures are valid only at the beginning of the test [20] ; in fact, due to the effect of the external load, the two components begin to deform plastically and the contact between pin and disk is progressively enlarged, leading to an increase in the effective contact area and a decrease in the pressure contact. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider that in the contact area there is a uniform distribution of the pressure determined by the hardness of the less hard of the two contact materials [21] .",

Values represent the average of 3 independent determinations From the analysis of the reported graphs, it is evident that the curve fits indicate that the samples were substantially uniform, even if with few exceptions, in term of wearing resistance. In Fig. 6a , the lower COF values found for the sample GHA50/20-1 were attributed to a possible variation in the formation of the tribolayer, together with a slight difference in the hardiness of the steel ball. In the case of Fig. 6b , the different behavior of sample GHA50/250-1 was, on the contrary, attributed to the higher initial roughness of the sample. Indeed, Rz, Ra and Rq are slightly larger (see Fig. 4 ) with respect the other 2 analyzed samples, resulting in a markedly different wear track (Fig. 6c) , with a much larger track and exposing the base aluminum alloy and formation of third body on the surface of the steel ball (see Fig. 6d ).",

The exact mechanism by which Ag exert its killing effect on bacteria and viruses is still mainly obscure. However, it has been consistently observed that Ag and Ag ions can interact with microbes in different ways. For instance, silver can interact with the structural proteins on the surface of extracellular viruses to inhibit infection in the early phase, by either preventing viral attachment or entry, or by damaging the surface proteins to affect the structural integrity of virions [11, 12] . In the case of bacteria, it has been shown that the interaction between silver and the constituents of the bacterial membrane can cause structural changes and damage to the membranes and intracellular metabolic activity, which might be the cause or consequence of cell death [11] .",

From the SEM/EDS analyses carried out on the worn surfaces, the main wear mechanisms detected were abrasion and tribo-oxidation. Specifically, at 250 m of sliding distance, the wear was characterized by the formation of surface oxide scales that reduce the contact between the two bodies and act as a sort of solid lubricant, reducing friction. Differently, at 20 m of sliding distance, a three-body abrasion, causing plastic deformation of the disk surface, took place.",
