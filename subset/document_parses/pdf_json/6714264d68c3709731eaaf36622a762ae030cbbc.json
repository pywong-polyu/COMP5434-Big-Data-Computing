The purpose of this review and analysis was to determine the efficacy of various interventions upon the inflammatory markers most affected by COVID-19. The focus was on the markers associated with COVID-19, not the etiology of the virus itself. Methods: Based on 27 reviewed papers, information was extracted on the effects of COVID-19 upon inflammatory markers, then the effects of standard treatments (Remdesivir, Tocilizumab) and adjunctive interventions (vitamin D 3 , melatonin, and meditation) were extracted for those markers. These data were used to approximate effect sizes for the disease or interventions via standardized mean differences (SMD). Results: The data that were available indicated that adjunctive interventions affected 68.4% of the inflammatory markers impacted by COVID-19, while standard pharmaceutical medication affected 26.3%. Discussion: Nonstandard adjunctive care appeared to have comparable or superior effects in comparison to Remdesivir and Tocilizumab on the inflammatory markers most impacted by COVID-19. Alongside standards of care, melatonin, vitamin D 3 , and meditation should be considered for treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.",

A persistent, low-level inflammatory response affects the innate immune system, adaptive immune system, and inflammatory mediators. 8 The dynamic mechanisms of chronic inflammation can lead to tissue damage, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and fibrosis in a variety of tissues, including the nervous system. 9 Many of the most damaging effects of COVID-19 are related to cascading systemic inflammation and resulting cytokine storms, affecting respiratory, cardiac, nervous, gastrointestinal, and immune systems concurrently. 10, 11 Patterns of comorbidity demographics indicate that COVID-19 both initiates inflammatory dysregulation and exacerbates existing systemic inflammation. 12 The prevalence and magnitude of stressors contributing to preexisting inflammation make a catalyst like COVID-19 especially dangerous. 13 ",

Some individuals who have fully cleared the virus still exhibit significantly impaired cardiopulmonary, central nervous, and peripheral nervous systems. 15 This suggests an eventual potential spike in pulmonary fibrosis, cardiopulmonary events, neuronal damage, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. [16] [17] [18] In addition to direct health impacts, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerabilities of healthcare systems. The heavy load on hospitals was likely exacerbated by high rates of metabolic syndrome, a low-grade inflammatory condition that is suspected to afflict 10-40% of the developed world's population and correlates to COVID-19 severity and comorbidities. 19 Lengthy recovery times and high prevalence of comorbidity resulted in overcrowded hospitals with rates of readmission as high as 1/6. 20 If COVID-19 were to mutate enough to escape the vaccines or if a new inflammatory pathogen emerges, the population is currently even more vulnerable than at the beginning of the current pandemic, with few effective mitigating interventions.",

COVID-19 often dysregulates pro-inflammatory chemokines that continue to stimulate this reaction until multiorgan damage occurs, often with fatal consequences for the infected individual. 22 The mechanism suspected in severe occurrences of the SARS-CoV2 virus is the cytokine storm, an event involving hyperactivity of immune cells that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, referred to as hypercytokinemia, which can lead to severe or even life-threatening cases of multiple organ failures. 23 Even though inflammatory symptoms may be more visible in particular parts of the body, the nature of cytokine storms is systemic, not acute or localized. Once chemokine and cytokine interactions have begun to spiral out of homeostasis, a system-wide feedback loop can be established which triggers effects in an extremely diverse set of bodily functions and organs. 24 Pulmonary complications, blood clots, and neurological issues are closely interwoven with systemic inflammation, making treatment of individual symptoms difficult. 25 Elevated TGF-beta plasma levels have been observed in respiratory diseases such as COPD and COVID-19 and maintain a central role in the pathophysiology of lung fibrosis during inflammation. 26, 27 In COVID-19 patients, TGF-beta upregulation contributes to cytokine release syndrome, pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome via increased capillary permeability. [28] [29] [30] [31] The complement system further drives TGF-beta release from platelets to promote systemic inflammation and coagulopathy. 32 SARS-CoV-2 infections also promote increased MAPK pathway mediated inflammation. 33, 34 ",

            "text": "The type of systemic dysregulation that both fuels the worst cases of COVID-19 and poses a lingering risk has been the subject of significant research relating to the efficacy of non-pharmacological adjunct interventions. 35 A particular area of focus has been referred to as \"integrative medicine,\" which incorporates systems-level approaches to health that include behavioral changes, mental practices, and nutritional adjustments, interventions which have been associated with significant improvements in stress levels, pain, cardiovascular health, and metabolic health. 36 Examples of these adjunct interventions that are relevant to COVID-19 treatment include meditation, vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol), and melatonin. [37] [38] [39] Targeted modulation of key cytokines such as TGF-beta with natural products such as artemisinin, an antimalarial lactone derived from Artemisia annua, may potentially help prevent pulmonary fibrosis in patients with respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 and could act as a potent cytokine-modulating adjunctive therapy as well, but insufficient data was present to include artemisinin or TGF-beta in this analysis. [40] [41] [42] [43] The mechanisms of action for these interventions are still being studied, but existing evidence suggests regulating influences that have significant effects on dysregulated inflammatory processes. Vitamin D 3 , for example, has been shown to improve immune function while also curbing cascading inflammation, with numerous studies linking it to reduced severity and deaths in COVID-19 cases. [44] [45] [46] The mechanism(s) behind melatonin is slightly less understood but potentially has the intriguing benefit of upregulating antiviral function while downregulating runaway inflammation. 47 Meditation has been linked to diverse psychological and physiological changes that improve homeostasis and diminish inflammatory feedback loops, though its mechanisms are still widely debated. 48 Theoretical modeling suggests behavioral health practices such as meditation and yoga may provide some degree of adjunctive efficacy against general infectious conditions through enhancements of endogenous levels of melatonin and other antiinflammatory or immuno-modulating processes. 49 This model was expanded to directly relate to COVID-19, with multidisciplinary evidence supporting the premise.",

While a reductionist model is ideal for acute conditions, COVID-19 and its complications require a systems model that incorporates multiple levels of connection, causality, and interaction.

Figure 2 reflects the compilation process for this research, through which a collection of search terms was designed to capture a wide sampling of sources related to quantitative interactions between inflammatory processes/markers and COVID-19, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, melatonin, meditation, and vitamin D 3 . Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were selected for analysis as a result of being the predominant pharmacological intervention for COVID at the time of data-gathering. Vitamin D 3 and melatonin were included as adjunctive interventions due to their repeated use in COVID infections, while meditation was also included as an adjunct intervention to analyze a potentially anti-inflammatory intervention that did not introduce external properties to the subject. 52 Though there are multiple meditative practices, the meditation studies included in this review focused primarily on mindfulness meditation. Due to the extremely recent nature of COVID-19 and the lack of significant research into many adjunctive approaches, selection also focused on known effects on biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV2 infection, not only on effects specific to COVID-19 infection. The markers tracked in interventions was moderately heterogeneous across studies and availability was a limiting factor in which interventions could be effectively tracked. The search terms were filtered to include studies providing an abstract and published 1999-2021, the date range being intended to ensure current terminology and comprehension of inflammatory disorders.

IL-6 is often reported as a pro-inflammatory marker and is one of the most dysregulated cytokines affected by COVID-19, but there have also been interactions with IL-6 that were wildly inconsistent across studies, sometimes demonstrating behavior directly opposing what is expected of an inflammatory marker. 28, 56 A possible explanation involves research indicating that there are two forms of IL-6, a proinflammatory IL-6 trans and a regulating antiinflammatory IL-6 classic. 79 All effects on IL-6 were calculated and regulating effects categorized as IL-6 classic, while dysregulating effects were categorized as IL-6 trans. Note that this is an internal categorization and does not reflect differentiation in the data. Should the premise of two forms of IL-6 be discounted the effect sizes toward a combined IL-6 will not be affected. Effect Size vs Significance Effect size by standardized mean difference (SMD or d) differs from statistical significance (p) and is the primary metric explored in this paper. This is driven by the fact that significance reports how likely a difference is due to chance, while effect size reports how large the difference is. When attempting to compare the potential effects of diverse interventions, p alone is insufficient to determine efficacy. The need for effect sizes when examining tangible effects was explained by the American Statistical Association:",

Catalyst effects which increase anti-inflammatory markers are labelled as regulating while catalyst effects which increase inflammatory markers are labelled as dysregulating. These are only broad tendencies and shall not be interpreted as universal qualities nor precise descriptions of the nuanced behavior of these markers. The studies incorporated into this analysis included numerous severity levels of COVID-19, different dosages of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, and various durations of adjunctive interventions. A limiting factor is the heterogeneity between states of illness and relative effect sizes on inflammatory markers, an example being the fact most COVID-19 patients were tracked only after developing acute symptoms while adjunctive interventions sometimes tracked otherwise healthy patients. In an attempt to detect broader patterns the individual results for each catalyst were combined and averaged.

The act of aggregating, calculating, approximating, and averaging effect sizes from very disparate sources creates the possibility of imprecision at multiple levels. As referenced above, differences in the initial health conditions and observation intervals of the participants in these studies are complicating factors that warrant examination. The consistent findings of data from distinct sources lends credibility to the overall findings, but review of the differentiated data is available and encouraged in Appendix A. The selection, characterization, and contextualization of highly complex inflammatory markers is likewise inherently approximate. Limited data on markers associated with many interventions also prevented a wider comparative analysis among standard medical approaches. In particular, it is important to note that although insufficient data were found to calculate effect sizes on IL-6 by Tocilizumab, this intervention is primarily known as an IL-6 inhibitor, so it can be assumed it has a significant effect on that marker. 82 While Tocilizumab and Remdesivir were being studied as leading interventions when this study began, by the time of publication they have been largely supplanted by more effective treatments. Comparison with contemporary standards of care is warranted. Most COVID-19 effects were tracked after admission to a hospital or care center, creating statistical sampling issues in relation to asymptomatic or misdiagnosed infections. Long-term examination of changes in inflammatory loads among asymptomatic infections is necessary to expand marker effect size accuracy.",
