It was widely reported that patients with diabetes mellitus had low VD levels, likely due to impaired hepatic and renal metabolism of VD, decreased dietary VD intake and reduced intestinal absorption of VD due to diabetic autonomic neuropathy (28-30). Moreover, low circulating VD levels were reported to be associated with poor glycemic control in diabetic patients and large prospective studies suggested that VD deficiency may predispose to a higher risk of developing impaired fasting glucose and diabetes (31-33), although the influence of VD supplementation on the diabetes onset risk is still unknown and, in a recent prospective randomized trial, VD supplementation did not result in a significantly lower risk of new-onset diabetes than placebo in prediabetic subjects (34).",

Several studies reported diabetic patients at higher risk of hospitalization, severe pulmonary involvement, and mortality compared to non-diabetic subjects (49,50). These findings suggest that glycemic control may improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19, although, a potential caveat in this regard may be represented by the finding that in ICU patients with critical illness a too tight GLU control could be rather harmful increasing mortality risk (51).",

In this specific setting, it could have been useful to assess also active or free VD (72, 73) . However, being these parameters not routinely available and due to the known methodological issues in their assays (36) they were not included in the study protocol. In conclusion, we found high prevalence of low VD levels in our cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to ED, which was associated with an increased disease severity likely through an excessive immune-inflammatory response. Moreover, we showed, for the first time, a significant association between VD levels and male sex, GLU levels and BMI in COVID-19 and since male sex, hyperglycemia and adiposity are largely recognized as a risk factors for worse disease, VD deficiency might be identified as a novel pathophysiological mechanism involved as common denominator of the endocrine phenotype (79,80) that negatively influence COVID-19 patients outcomes (14).

Several pathophysiological mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the associations between fat body mass excess and hypovitaminosis D, including lower dietary intake of VD, decreased outdoor physical activity with poorer skin exposure to impaired hydroxylation in adipose tissue, VD accumulation in fat and alterations in VD-receptors in patients with body fat excess (26,27).",
