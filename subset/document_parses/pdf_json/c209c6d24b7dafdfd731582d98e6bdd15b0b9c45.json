Fear of adverse reactions was the most important barrier among all the respondents. The prevalent perception was that other preventive practices and vaccine together can only be the best solution to prevent COVID-19 illness. The HCWs perceived that acceptance of vaccine among the community members would be good overall but apprehended some initial difficulties. Mass campaign to promote COVID-19 vaccination and sensitization events are the need of the hour.",

[1] Since its emergence, it has spread to various countries and territories around the globe due to the highly infectious nature of this virus. [2] Severe impact on morbidity and mortality of the people, health system, economic and social progress occurred due to this pandemic. [3] While countries have taken various strategies to contain the spread of COVID-19 through preventive measures, better diagnostics, and treatment, vaccines can provide an enduring solution by enhancing immunity and preventing the disease spread. Researchers have also developed several prediction models in forecasting the pandemic and the effects of several containment and preventive strategies but with limited success. [4] With the beginning of the pandemic and its growing menace, COVID vaccine has been a much anticipated issue, with several vaccines now being tested for suitability and mass administration. [3, 5] At present, in India, COVID-19 vaccine has been rolled out on January 16, 2021, under the guidance of National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19. [3, 6] The proposition is to offer the vaccine first to health-care and frontline workers and population above 50 years of age, followed by population below 50 years of age with associated comorbidities, and finally to the remaining population. [3] A global survey conducted in different countries reported relatively high tendency toward acceptance of vaccine in countries such as Brazil, India, and South Africa. [7] People's perception about the vaccine, threat perception of the disease, and health-care workers' (HCWs') opinion were the key influencers in willingness-hesitancy spectrum of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. [8] The HCWs reported considerably higher proportion of willingness to accept the vaccine. [9] To exert effective control of COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries like India, a high and uniform coverage among the beneficiaries is essential, for which it is necessary to understand the factors affecting willingness to accept vaccine and develop appropriate vaccination strategy. [10] HCWs being the key informants can provide proper information regarding the vaccine and can also influence the community. Willingness of the beneficiaries (i.e., HCWs and the community at large) for uptake of the vaccine is of essence to ensure successful implementation of this vaccination drive in India. The influencers and the barriers in the willingness-hesitancy spectrum warrant an in-depth exploration which require qualitative approaches and can be done efficiently from a primary care delivery setup. Regarding this much-awaited COVID vaccine, the study was conducted to find the perceptions regarding the vaccine and understand the influencers and the barriers of vaccine acceptance. The findings carry great relevance, especially in the current context of now, launched COVID-19 vaccination drive in India, for understanding and devising ways to address probable hindrances.",

These two groups were also perceived to be more vulnerable than others and observed to be more eager to take vaccine. Appropriate risk-communication and high-risk group counseling have been documented to be of importance in improving adult acceptance of immunization in primary care settings. [17] Similarly, in a web-based online survey conducted in Saudi Arabia, higher perceived risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection was an important determinant in acceptance of vaccine, emphasizing the perception of threat to be a major determinant of health behavior. [18] Adverse reactions related to the vaccine were an important concern being explored among the HCWs, for which they prefer to observe their colleagues to find any significant adverse reactions occurring. Gadoth et al. (2021) reported that among HCWs of Los Angeles, apprehension over serious adverse reactions was an important component. [19] Probability of serious adverse reaction of vaccine was chief barrier in the community also. In consonance with this finding, potential side effects of vaccine appeared to be important barrier in acceptance of vaccine in studies by Dodd et al. and by Reiter et al. [8, 20] Not only in case of this new vaccine, the fear of adverse effect has been reported to have contributed to vaccine hesitancy in case of childhood vaccination as well. [21] In this study, majority of the community members had perceptions that vaccine will be very effective. Wide variation of opinion evolved among HCWs regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine. Whether perceived effectiveness of the vaccine acts as an influencer or barrier could not be elicited in the study. Following complete roll out of the vaccine(s), researches may be undertaken to understand the role of such perception-related factors.",

Provision of vaccine in the manner of door-to-door service or house-to-house service emerged as an important influencer among community members in increasing the willingness of acceptance of the vaccine. A unique issue explored in the current study was regarding the effectiveness of other preventive practices in comparison to vaccine in prevention of the disease. Majority among the community members perceived that preventive practices and vaccine together would be the ultimate solution in prevention of the disease. However, HCWs had mixed opinion regarding this issue. The HCWs perceived that in near future, acceptability of the vaccine among community members will be encouraging though during initial phases some hesitation can persist. Mass campaign and sensitization program can be the solution to increase the acceptance as suggested by the HCWs. Initiatives such as mass campaign and sensitization programs taken by the health-care providers can bring about change by increasing the vaccine acceptance among beneficiaries. On the other hand, re-enforcement regarding practice of preventive measures should be made among the population irrespective of the vaccination status.",
