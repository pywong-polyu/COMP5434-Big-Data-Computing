Brazil has high rates of COVID-19 contamination and mortality among healthcare professionals, especially nurses (8, 9) . To date, the cohort has experienced the death of a nursing technician. We speculate that despite the risk of exposure to patients from working in the hospital environment, many employees were contaminated by other employees (asymptomatic, presymptomatic or symptomatic), by family members or when traveling to the hospital by public transport. It is also important to note that professionals work in various public and private hospitals, acting as vectors of transmission between different units. The cases of infection among healthcare professionals at the institute preceded the hospitalization of the first patient, reflecting probable contamination from another unit or from the community. For the vast majority of cases, there are no data to establish where contamination occurred.",

The testing included all hospital employees, who can be divided into three categories according to their risk of exposure: those with no contact (administrative personnel), indirect contact (cleaning, information technology, pharmacy, security, general services, building maintenance and clinical engineering personnel) or direct contact with patients (doctors, nurses, physical therapists, nutritionists, and occupational therapists). Asymptomatic patients were not screened. Employees who were positive or had severe symptoms (fever, dyspnea, severe prostration) were removed from work for 14 Swab samples were gently homogenized, and 300 \u00b5l of transport medium was separated for viral RNA extraction. The rest of the material was stored at -80 \u00b0C. Viral RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions using the ReliaPrep Viral TNA Mini-Prep kit (Promega, cat. AX4820) or the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, cat. 57704).",
