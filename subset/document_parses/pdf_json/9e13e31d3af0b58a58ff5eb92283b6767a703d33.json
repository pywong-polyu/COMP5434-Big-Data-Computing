Such symptoms often occur four or more weeks after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Although a lot of work has gone into understanding the long-term mental health effects of PASC, many questions related to the etiology and risk of this condition remain. Thus, this protocol is for a systematic review assessing the association between PASC and adverse psychiatric outcomes and whether people with PASC are at greater risk of developing an adverse psychiatric outcome than those without PASC.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Persistent and long-lasting (>4 weeks ) symptoms following infection with acute COVID-19 have given rise to a syndrome known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long COVID. 1 Incidence and prevalence estimates for people with COVID-19 presenting with or reporting persistent psychiatric symptoms months following initial infection range from 0.8 -49% 1,2,3,4,5 Among 44 759 people with no recorded history of psychiatric illness, the estimated overall probability of being diagnosed with newonset psychiatric illness in the 90 days following a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5.8% in a retrospective cohort study. 6 Similarly, clinical anxiety and depression, as well as other psychiatric sequelae, have been reported following diagnosis with COVID-19 in other studies. 6, 7, 8 Although sex and age are considered to be sociodemographic risk factors for PASC, there is no consensus on other baseline clinical features that act as independent predictors of PASC. 9, 10 The prevalence of PASC symptoms is higher in women compared with men. 10 . Among people aged 35-49 years, the prevalence of PASC is 26.8% compared with 26.1% and 18% among people aged 50-69 years and 70 years or older, respectively. 10 Persistent symptoms occur weeks and months after infection irrespective of initial disease severity (mild, moderate, severe, critical). 11, 12 Mendez et al. reported in their cross-sectional study that two months after discharge, neurocognitive impairment, psychiatric morbidity, and poor quality of life were markedly prevalent among 179 COVID-19 survivors who had been hospitalized. 12 Nevertheless, Vannorsdall and Oh posit that current research on the post-acute phase following hospitalization has been conflicting due to the absence of a detailed, standardized neuropsychological evaluation of COVID-19 patients after hospitalization. 13 In addition, they stated that literature on PASC and adverse mental health outcomes are mostly limited to studies that cannot establish causal relationships or lack generalizability (e.g., case reports, case series, and data obtained from cognitive screening instruments). 13 Thus, more highquality studies are warranted. 13 In a study where the short-term and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 were systematically evaluated, PASC was categorized as short-term (1 month), intermediate-term (2-5 months) , and long-term (\u2265 6 months) following COVID-19 diagnosis. 14 Clinical manifestations of PASC were classified into organ systems, i.e., cardiovascular, dermatologic, digestive, ear, nose, and throat; mental health, neurologic, and respiratory; constitutional symptoms; and functional mobility. 14 The mechanisms leading to the post-acute and chronic neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 are thought to be due to the direct effect of the viral infection and the indirect effect on mental health due to social isolation, posttraumatic stress, and job loss. Specifically, correlations have been observed between COVID-19 posttraumatic stress scores, general distress, and sleep disruption. 14, 15 Despite those correlations, Khubchandani et al. stated that the causal pathways and etiology of adverse mental health outcomes in people who were infected with COVID-19 are multidimensional and complex. 16 To clarify whether COVID-19 is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders and vice-versa, an electronic health record network cohort study of 69 million people consisting of 62 354 people with a COVID-19 diagnosis compared the rates of psychiatric sequelae of health in the initial four months of the pandemic (January -April 2020) and subsequently (after April 2020). 17 . The study found that the rate of all diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and relapses was greater following a COVID-19 infection compared with after control health events (e.g., influenza infection, skin infection, other respiratory tract infections, and fracture). 17 Similarly, a diagnosis of psychiatric disorder in the 12 months preceding the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a 65% increased risk of COVID-19 (relative risk (RR) = 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.59-1.71; p < 0.0001) compared with a matched cohort of people with specific physical risk factors for COVID-19 minus a psychiatric diagnosis. 17 Whereas these associations were partly attributed to illness severity and pandemic-related contextual factors (e.g., social isolation, overwhelmed healthcare systems, and stigma), they do not adequately account for observed differences in psychiatric sequelae. 17 Moreover, the inability to conclusively determine why there were between twofold and threefold increases in the risk of neurologic and psychiatric complications following a COVID-19 infection, in this and other studies, calls for further examination of the association between COVID-19 and risk factors for psychiatric morbidity. 17, 18, 19 With many long-term adverse mental health outcomes linked to COVID-19, effective interventions which optimize recovery and minimize relapse are needed. Such interventions may serve as appropriate tools to evaluate risk factors that may cause maladaptive psychiatric responses. 20 Furthermore, they may aid with the management of anxiety, fear, frustration, stigma, and paranoia by mitigating psychopathological symptoms and reducing contextual stress. 20 Interventions that have been assessed in COVID-19 patients include: virtual and physical psychotherapeutic approaches, e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), emotional freedom techniques (EFT), and ultra-brief psychological interventions (UBPI); combined psychiatric and psychological interventions; technology and media; complementary and alternative therapies; self-care; spirituality and religion; and pharmacological. 21, 22 In a randomized controlled clinical trial of 51 people with COVID-19 consisting of an experimental group receiving progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) technology for 30 minutes each day for five consecutive days and a control group receiving only usual care and treatment, subjects in the experimental group reported lower depressive symptoms, lower anxiety levels, and better sleep quality compared with those in the control group. 23 Another randomized control .

A prospective cohort study of patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) three months after initial COVID-19 symptom onset noted impairment with self-care and anxiety or depression as being present in 13% and 22% of its 78 subjects with at least one Charlson comorbidity at baseline compared to subjects without any Charlson comorbidities (4% and 9% respectively). Among subjects without any Charlson comorbidities, 70% reported an abnormal PROM, and 33% had at least one moderate issue in at least one EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D). 29 In addition, questions remain about the long-term ((\u2265 6 months) outcomes of Although some studies indicate that most people who acquire COVID-19 are at risk of psychiatric sequelae and their symptoms tend to improve over time, others suggest that symptoms may worsen over time or point to a different disease trajectory. 30, 31 Research and any future recommendations about PASC and mental health should be guided by the best available evidence.",

Information related to a variable (exposure, outcome, covariate), misclassification, confounding, participant selection, reverse causation, missing data, study power, and generalizability will be appraised. Two reviewers will initially pilot the checklist to enhance consistency, mitigate potential issues with mechanistic scoring, and mitigate performance bias in the overall risk of bias assessment. Studies that do not adequately report on statistical analyses or address confounding, biases (selection, performance, detection, attrition), and other biases will be deemed lower quality studies, i.e., when they consistently have 'no,' 'unclear, and 'not applicable' ratings' across relevant items.",

A random-effects meta-analysis will be conducted if possible. Statistical heterogeneity across studies will be explored using Higgins I 2 and Cochran's Q statistics. A Cochran's Q test based on a \u03c7 2 statistic with a p <0.05 and greater than the degrees of freedom (df) will indicate heterogeneity. The I 2 statistic will be interpreted as follows: 0-40% = minimal heterogeneity; 30-60% = moderate heterogeneity; 50-90% = substantial heterogeneity; 75-100% = considerable heterogeneity. If there is substantial heterogeneity, subgroup analysis (based on the duration of PASC or COVID-19 severity) will be conducted. Subgroup effect sizes (Cohen's d or Hedges g) and correlations will be assessed and compared with unadjusted values to interpret for meaningful effects. Observed effects will be considered robust if the effect estimates of the primary outcome remain consistent or there are no large differences in the magnitude of effect across subgroups. Subgroup analyses will not be performed if there is minimal or moderate heterogeneity. A narrative synthesis will be performed if meta-analysis is not possible. The reasons for not pooling data (e.g., high statistical, methodological, and clinical heterogeneity) will be reported in the review. A methodological quality-based sensitivity analysis presented as a summary table will be used to assess the robustness of the findings. Authors of included studies with missing information will be contacted for clarification. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach will be used to rate the overall certainty of the evidence obtained from the study.",
