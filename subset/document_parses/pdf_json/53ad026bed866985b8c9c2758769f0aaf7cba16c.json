In order to assure that 2019 was a good representation of the typical admissions numbers, we reviewed the number of adult and pediatric patients that were admitted in our Burn Center during the same time period of 2016, 2017 and 2018. We observed a stable trend in the data above mentioned, so we considered that 2019 was representative of a normal year in terms of burn admissions numbers in our Center. For each patient were analyzed the following variables: Age and gender, date of admission to the Burn Unit, total body surface area (TBSA) burned, burn depth, burns involving head or neck, number of surgical procedures, intensive care utilisation, inhalation injury, days of hospitalization and COVID PCR test result. The burn etiology, mechanism of injury and the circumstances surrounding the accident were determined as far as possible in order to develop focused prevention strategies. Both groups were compared to explore if there were differences between them. Furthermore, we made a separate analysis of patients aged 0\u00c016 years old.",

The Vall d'Hebron Burn Center has faced an unprecedented challenge during the current COVID-19 epidemic: On one hand, it became a non-COVID ICU admitting severely polytraumatized patients (including those with neurotrauma or acute spinal cord injury) and patients with other critical conditions, like sepsis. On the other hand, the center continued offering burn care to our big reference population (approximately 8 million people), striking a balance between contributing to the epidemic response and preserving ongoing burn care in a safe and ethical fashion, as previously recommended by international burn experts [4] . Under such circumstances, one of our main concerns was to maintain the Burn Unit as a free-COVID area. For this reason, from March 19, 2020 (when the number of COVID patients exponentially increased in the hospital), all the patients undergoing admission (either burn patients or non-COVID critically ill patients) were PCR-tested and isolated regardless of symptoms before their admission to our Burn Center. Isolation was maintained until negative results were confirmed. Due to this meticulous screening, we did not have any case of COVID-19 positive patient in our unit after March 19, preserving burn center function and non-COVID ICU function. Before March 19, two positive SARS-COV 2 patients were confirmed and transferred to a COVID area.",

This can be mainly explained due to the confinement of the population and the decrease of industrial activity and traffic accidents; furthermore, people who suffered minor burns refrained from consult likely because they were fearful of visiting our hospital (where the incidence of COVID-19 admissions was the highest in Catalonia). Moreover, authorities advised to avoid unnecessary visits to hospital.",

We did not identify any factor that explains the increase in the pediatric patients' admissions, other than the mandatory confinement: all the regional pediatric centers remained opened and maintained their activity. In addition, we are the only reference center for pediatric burn patients in our whole reference region, that includes Catalonia, Balearic Islands (except Ibiza) and Andorra. This finding is consistent with those made by other authors [6, 7] . That can be mostly explained by the strict confinement measures implemented in Spain (probably the strictest in Europe): children were not allowed to exercise outside, take walks or leave their house except for medical reasons, resulting in bored and psychologically exhausted children. This situation combined with parental burnout, who continued remotely working, may led to a lack of sustained or adequate supervision. Moreover, multiple studies suggest that most of the burns in children occur at home, where they are close to hot liquids and participate in tasks like cooking, ironing, etc. [8, 9] .",

Furthermore, we noted an increase in flame burns from the ignition of clothing and misuse of inflammable substances. In addition, an increase in the number of burns among school-age children (over 4 years old) was noted during the confinement. Whilst scald burns are seen by most authors as the most common burn etiology among children aged 0\u00c04 years old [10\u00c015], flame burns are more common among older children, often due to fire play and risk-taking behaviors, resulting in larger and deeper burns [8, 14, 16, 17] .",

We also found a decrease in the proportion of above 65 years age group admissions during Period 1 (16%) compared to Period 2 (30%).

Furthermore, our investigation of burn incidents in children during both periods reveal a predominant burn cause (scald from hot drinks and cooking liquids) and repeated mechanisms of injury consisting in: (1) child pulling pans, mugs or kettles from cooker tops and tables (2), accidental spill of hot liquids when holding a young child and cooking or drinking hot beverages at the same time. Similar injury mechanisms have been also reported by other authors [ 15,20\u00c022] . In addition, we observed a surge in scalds resulting from the practice of steam inhalation during the lockdown period, as a home method to prevent and treat respiratory infections. Other centers have also reported an increase in scalds relating to steam inhalation during the confinement [7, 23] .",
