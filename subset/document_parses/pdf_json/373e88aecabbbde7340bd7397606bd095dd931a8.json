Conversely, genes E and M consistently use the broader set of synonymous codons, which does not vary in respect to the reference genome. CAI and SiD time evolutions show a tendency to decrease that emerge for most genes. Forsdyke plots are used to study the nature of mutations and they show a rapid evolutionary divergence of each gene, due to the low values of x-intercepets.",

SARS-CoV2 belongs to Coronaviridae family, with a genome around 30 kb in length and a structure characteristic of known coronaviruses. The virus genome encodes for structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins [12] . The four structural proteins are the envelope protein (E), the membrane protein (M), the nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike glycoprotein (S). ORF1ab gene encodes for the two isoforms of the poliprotein complex pp1a and pp1ab, where the first is the intial segment of the latter, which are further proteolytically cleaved to produce 16 different non-structural proteins.

Envelope protein analysis is redundant for constant CAI values through evolution. The distribution of each codon in P C 1 is more uniform, resulting from a weighted and coherent contribution of all codons, whereas, in P C 2 the contribution is more focused on specific codons. The fastest evolving gene appears to be the one coding for Nucleocapsid with a globally descending trend. Spike too displays the same trend but with a down-peak in the month of July.

After filtering out incomplete genomes, we retained a total of 134,905 complete genomes, with the purpose of investigating their divergences from the first sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC 045512.2). We focused on seven SARS-CoV-2 genes/proteins that are crucial for virus structure, synthesis, transmissibility and virulence, namely the Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane, Envelope, RdRp and the two segments of ORF 1ab separately, ORF 1a and ORF 1b. The SARS-CoV-2 genomes have a tendency to diverge constantly from the reference genome. This is in accordance with a recent study by Pachetti and colleagues (2020) where they have demonstrated that the number of SARS-CoV-2 mutations change over time [4] . The accumulation of mutations most likely affects the codon usage bias and has been investigated through RSCU, CAI, SiD and ENC.",

Envelope appears to be the most spread but it should be considered that there are more than 134,000 points for that gene, that must be localized. Due to its shortness, every mutation has a high impact on the RSCU, resulting in a rather dispersed cluster. Nucleocapsid spread instead is due to the high rate of mutations occurring in that gene.",

This is in contrast with the initial hypothesis of adaptation of the viral Codon Usage to the host one. An explanation can be found in the already high starting values for SiD and CAI: having a close codon usage with the host would increase the efficiency of translation, for the cellular resources could be used in the most efficient way, speeding up viral replication. This can lead to the death of the host and is thought to be counterproductive for the virus, as it would stop its spreading. For this reason, an efficiency balance needs to be reached through continuous adjustments.",
