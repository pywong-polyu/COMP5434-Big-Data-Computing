Here we present methods for estimating force of infection from serological surveys of infections which produce lasting immunity, taking into account imperfections in the test used, and uncertainty in such imperfections. The methods cover both single serological surveys, in which age is a proxy for time at risk, and repeat surveys in the same people, in which the force of infection is estimated more directly. Fixed values can be used for the sensitivity and specificity of the tests, or existing methods for belief elicitation can be used to include uncertainty in these values. The latter may be applicable, for example, when the specificity of a test depends on co-circulating pathogens, which may not have been well characterized in the setting of interest. We illustrate the methods using data from two published serological studies of dengue.",

For infections inducing lasting immunity, the force of infection is usually estimated via serological surveys ('serosurveys') of immunological status. Ideally, assays used in serosurveys should be highly sensitive and specific while also suitable for high throughput, in terms of the cost and personnel required (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . In practice, however, available assays may not completely meet all these criteria, as is currently evident with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID19) (12) .",

Previous studies have simultaneously estimated test sensitivity and force of infection for single or repeat surveys (16) (17) (18) , and estimated the force of infection subject to fixed values for sensitivity and specificity in a single survey (20) . Here we present methods for estimating the force of infection taking into account imperfect sensitivity and/or specificity, and uncertainty in these parameters, for either single or repeat surveys. Should wellestablished and generalizable values of sensitivity and specificity be available, they can be used in the methods described here. However, this is not always the case.

In effect, the elicited distribution is both the prior and posterior distribution. This approach was shown for the model for repeat surveys but could equally be applied to the one for a single survey. It was illustrated by eliciting beliefs about sensitivity and specificity from a single expert. To reach substantive conclusions, multiple experts would be required (25) . Estimates from systematic reviews could be used instead of expert opinion if they were generalizable to a given study area.",

The baseline seroprevalence is assigned a beta distribution with both parameters equal to 1, i.e. uniform on the interval [0,1]. The prior for the second seroprevalence is the same except that, consistent with the above assumptions, it is constrained to be at least as high as the baseline seroprevalence. For each survey, the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) are defined in terms of the seroprevalence and the assumed sensitivity and specificity: PPV = S e \u03c0 / (S e \u03c0 + (1-S p )(1-\u03c0)) NPV = S p (1\u2212\u03c0) / ((1-S e )\u03c0 + S p (1-\u03c0)) The probability of each person being truly seropositive, Prob(D + ), is then PPV if the test is positive, and 1-NPV if the test is negative. The probabilities of testing positive or negative are functions of sensitivity and specificity, in the same way as for a single survey. Finally, the numerator of the force of infection is estimated as the increase in expected number of true positives from the first to the second survey, and the denominator is estimated as the expected person-time at risk, calculated as the sum of the individual times between the surveys, weighted by each individual's probability of being seronegative at baseline. This is shown in the following equation, where the sum is over all individuals in both surveys, and the subscripts on D indicate the first or second survey:",

For the current purpose, the estimated force of infection is evidently strongly associated with the sensitivity and specificity. Although posterior likelihoods of sensitivity, specificity and force of infection could be obtained from a formally consistent Bayesian model, the identifiability of such a model would need to be demonstrated. Our interest here is in information on sensitivity and specificity as inputs, not outputs. Hence, we have not referred to the elicited beliefs for sensitivity and specificity as \"priors\". Although these beliefs are used in Monte Carlo simulation, posterior likelihoods are not obtained for them. Rather, values are repeatedly sampled from the fitted beta distributions of sensitivity and specificity, then MCMC estimation is done based for a parameter are estimated as quantiles of samples drawn, via MCMC, from its Bayesian posterior distribution. Confidence intervals are quoted from frequentist analyses which were carried out for comparison.SoftwareWe use the \"rjags\" package in R (version 3.6.3; The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).This package requires a separate installation of the JAGS package(29). R code is provided in Appendix 2. For the analysis of the Colombo survey, for each value of sensitivity and specificity used, a burn-in of 1,000 iterations was used, with estimates of the force of infection based on 50,000 iterations thinned by 10 (i.e. keeping every 10 th result). For the analysis of the repeat surveys in Medellin, the following was done separately for sensitivity and specificity: 2,000 draws were made from the fitted beta distribution then, for each draw, there was a burn-in of 2,000 and the force of infection was estimated from 5,000 iterations thinned by 50. This was done i) with sensitivity varying while holding specificity at 100%, ii) the reverse, and iii) with both parameters varying. Hence the distribution of the force of infection was estimated from 20,000 values. Assessment of convergence was done visually.",

These are from only one expert and only used and intended for illustrative purposes. The distribution for specificity is closer to 100% and with lower variance than that for sensitivity. The figure also shows the fitted beta and logisticnormal distributions, the former of which was used to generate the force of infection results inFigure 5.Results from the force of infection model are shown inFigure 5. As expected fromFigure 4, the distribution of the force of infection taking into account uncertainty in specificity (Figure 5a) has smaller variation than that for sensitivity(Figure 5b). For the former, the point estimate of the force of infection is 4.8% per year, with a 95% credible interval from 4.0 to 5.8%. For varying sensitivity, the point estimate is much higher, at 15.6% per year, and the credible interval much wider: 5.5% to 44.4%. With sensitivity and specificity both",
