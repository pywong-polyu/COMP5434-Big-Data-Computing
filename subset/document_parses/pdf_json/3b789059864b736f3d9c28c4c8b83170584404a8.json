Multiple sclerosis contributes to significant burden on patients and caregivers. The pharmacological treatment in MS involves treating acute exacerbations and preventing relapses and disability progression using disease-modifying therapies. Clinical evidence suggests that teriflunomide is one of the therapeutic choices for patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). However, genetic and cultural differences across different regions may contribute to variations in drug use. Therefore, it is necessary to consider real-world evidence for teriflunomide usage in GCC countries. Methods: An expert group for MS gathered from GCC countries in December 2020. The consensus highlighting role of teriflunomide in MS management has been developed using clinical experiences and evidence-based approach. Results: The expert-recommended patient profile for teriflunomide usage includes individuals aged 18 years and above, both men and women (on effective contraceptives) with clinically isolated syndrome or RRMS. The factors considered were cost-effectiveness of the drug, patient preference, adherence, monitoring, established safety profile, and coronavirus disease 2019 status. Conclusion: Expert recommendations based on their clinical experience will be more helpful to clinicians in clinical settings regarding the usage of teriflunomide and provide valuable insights applicable in day-today practice.",

            "text": "The variety of treatments currently available and emerging therapies prompt that the management of MS cannot fit into the \"one-size-fits-all\" model. Hence, these treatments may be used as sequential monotherapies or for escalation or induction strategies based on the efficacy and safety measures. 9 However, the choice of treatment decision is essential and is highly specific to the individual undergoing treatment, considering the genetic and environmental factors that play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MS and/or disease progression and response to drugs. 10 Currently, many disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are approved for RRMS management. The oral DMTs have resulted in better compliance as compared with injectables. 11 Teriflunomide, an oral DMT, has shown promising clinical trial efficacy and safety outcomes in the management of RRMS. Most importantly, teriflunomide selectively and reversibly inhibits the key mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase requisite for de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway, leading to reduced proliferation of activated T and B lymphocytes without causing cell death. 12 This mechanism is effectively highlighted in phase III teriflunomide trials that state the therapeutic benefits of teriflunomide without causing clinical immune suppression. 12 Teriflunomide is known to be well tolerated with minimum safety concerns; the latter include its long half-life, potential teratogenicity, and monitoring for potential hepatotoxicity. 9 Therefore, in the current narrative review, we, a group of neurologists and experts in MS management from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, provide consensus recommendations to establish a broad patient profile recommendation for teriflunomide usage. This recommendation would support the treating physicians and patients to decide on the usage of teriflunomide as a treatment option in the management of MS patients.",

These study findings are in line with the Teri-PRO (study using patient-reported outcomes to evaluate teriflunomide treatment in relapsing MS patients) trial that confirmed no disease progression for the entire duration of the trial as reported by both the patient-and physician-reported measures. The probability of no evidence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity was found to be significantly greater (baseline vs. posttreatment: 48.1 vs. 92.3, p < 0.0003). The TEMSO core study also reported a greater probability of no evidence of MRI activity in recently diagnosed patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg vs. placebo over 2 years. 15, 17 A study examining the rebound disease activity in patients who transitioned to teriflunomide reported no change in EDSS at 12 months as compared with baseline. 22 A complete nationwide population-based cohort study conducted in 3239 patients who were treated with teriflunomide depicted that there was a higher percentage of patients in the treatment-naive group experienced relapse when compared to the patients who had been treated with teriflunomide (p < 0.0001). 23 The adverse events reported (n/N [%]) in the Kuwait cohort were hair thinning ( (Table 1) . These safety results were comparable to the major clinical trials, namely Teriflunomide Phase II, TEMSO, TOWER, and TOPIC (Table 1) . 15 The realworld cases discussed by the experts (unpublished) reported hair thinning as a repeated side effect of teriflunomide. However, the experts agreed that this problem was transient and subsided after 3 months into the therapy, and patient education about hair thinning is important to prevent teriflunomide discontinuation. However, discontinuation of the drug is the only option in patients with severe hair loss even after 3 months.",

When compared to healthy controls, no significant deterioration was noted over the follow-up in brain volume or normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) global or tract-based spatial statistics DTI measures in MS patients. This study suggested that treatment with teriflunomide had shown potential effects by slowing down the accumulation of microstructural tissue damage in the GM and NAWM. 24 Additionally, no clinical progression or adverse events occurred during the follow-up. 24 The patient-reported outcome studies have reported increased preference, higher adherence, and greater patient satisfaction to oral DMTs. 25 Pregnancy outcomes in patients with MS treated with teriflunomide A 26-question survey conducted in women with MS reported oral treatment was significantly more common in women with no desire for children vs. short-and medium-term desire (p < 0.01 for both). This questionnaire-based study also stated issues surrounding pregnancy influence therapy choice in women of childbearing age with MS. 27 Another clinical study and post marketing data reported consistent pregnancy outcomes in the general population and patients with MS treated with teriflunomide monotherapy. This study even ruled out the teratogenic signal in teriflunomide-exposed pregnancies. 28 The Teriflunomide Pregnancy Registry Enrollment Update also reported similar findings and reported no structural or functional abnormalities in newborns of women or partners of men exposed to teriflunomide during pregnancy. 29 Based on the real-world clinical experience, experts from Oman seconded the study findings and they stated that, as per the standard protocol, women of reproductive age who are on effective contraception should limit the usage of teriflunomide.",

These three patients were switchers to teriflunomide before contracting COVID-19, that is, two patients received interferon beta-1a and the third patient received dimethyl fumarate. They switched to teriflunomide due to side effects associated with these DMTs. Two cases were those of nurses (36-year-old female and 29-year-old male). The patients were cured of COVID-19 while on teriflunomide treatment without any event or side effects. In line with this observation, a case report and literature review of usage of teriflunomide in COVID-19 suggested that MS patients who develop the COVID-19 infection should not discontinue teriflunomide therapy. 30 Another study featuring five cases of COVID-19 in teriflunomide-treated MS patients stated that the patients continued the therapy with self-limiting infection and without relapse. 31 This review highlights synergy in the outcomes of the clinical trial and the real-world studies.",

Further, this French Covisep registry elucidated that age, EDSS, and obesity were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. 32 The MS International Federation (MSIF) suggests that people with MS taking DMTs, including teriflunomide, do not have an increased risk of more severe COVID-19 symptoms. 33 Teriflunomide noncompetitively and reversibly inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a mitochondrial enzyme. Inhibition of DHODH interferes with pyrimidine synthesis and might affect the viral replication that might explain its potential antiviral effects, as reported by in vitro experiments. The in vitro experiment reported that inhibiting DHODH results in pyrimidine depletion, thereby delaying the coronavirus replication. 34, 35 In the case of COVID-19 infection, teriflunomide demonstrated antiviral activity and mild immunomodulatory potential. 35 Teriflunomide may be a relatively safe option to continue ongoing treatment or start with newly diagnosed MS patients with mild activity during the pandemic. Its safety reports in patients infected with COVID-19 are limited. 36 Precautions for reducing the risk of infection with COVID-19 in patients with MS 33",

Besides general safety measures, the following precautions have to be undertaken: Discuss with your healthcare provider about optimal care plans, through video consultations or in-person visits where needed. Do not avoid hospital visits if they are recommended based on your current health needs. \u2022 Stay active and try to take part in activities that will enhance your mental health and well-being. Physical exercise and social activities that can take place outside and with social distancing are encouraged. \u2022 Caregivers and family members who live with, or regularly visit, a person with MS in one of the higher-risk groups should also follow these recommendations to reduce the chance of bringing COVID-19 infection into the home. Patients with progressive MS, those who are older, those who have a higher level of physical disability, those with comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and heart and lung disease), and Black and Hispanic populations are among groups with the highest risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19.

Majority of patients on teriflunomide were females(22/33 [66.7%]). The age group of the patients with MS who switched to teriflunomide was 20-39 years. Majority of switchers to teriflunomide received treatment with interferons and 12 na\u00efve patients received treatment with teriflunomide. One patient discontinued the drug due to side effects. Three patients stopped due to relapses. Unplanned pregnancy was reported in 2 patients while 3 other patients reported hair thinning. TheTable 1. Overview of real-world studies on teriflunomide and Kuwait cohort study.Defined as a new neurological abnormality separated by at least 30 days from the onset of a preceding clinical event, present for at least 24 h, and occurring in the absence of fever or known infection. At least one functional system score or the EDSS score must have increased compared with the previous EDSS assessment,consistent  with the patient's symptoms. Screening of patients for entry into the TOPIC study was stopped due to 2010 revisions to the MS diagnostic criteria, which enabled an earlier diagnosis of MS (in some cases at the first clinical event). Patients who were still participating in the study at the stoppage could enter the extension study and receive active treatment with teriflunomide 14 mg or 7 mg.

As most COVID-19 vaccines, including the mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines, do not contain live infectious agents, vaccination is safe for MS patients.33,37,38 Of note, there is no evidence that MS patients are at a higher risk of complications from the mRNA, nonreplicating viral vector, inactivated virus, or protein COVID-19 vaccines compared to the general population.33 Although data on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in those with MS is not yet available, science suggests that COVID-19 vaccines are likely to be safe and effective for those with MS.37 Evidence suggests all patients with MS, including those on any class of DMT (none of which are associated with significant peripheral immunosuppression), can and should be vaccinated against COVID-19.33,37,38 The MSIF further suggested that the COVID-19 vaccine injection should not delay the initiation of DMTs including teriflunomide therapy in MS patients. No dose adjustments are needed if MS patients are already on DMTs including teriflunomide therapy.33,37",
