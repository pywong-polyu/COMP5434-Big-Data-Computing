The impact on healthcare extends beyond COVID-19 management and entails important considerations for clinical services, research and education across primary care and most medical subspecialties; the deferral of activities deemed non-essential (i.e. unrelated to COVID-19 planning and management) are commonplace during this pandemic.",

Medi-yoga is a therapeutic form of Kundalini yoga with simple movements, breathing exercises and meditation. Participants use a tablet with an Internet connection for the online yoga sessions and an application to support daily individual yoga practice. The primary endpoint is a composite of physical function, healthrelated quality of life and symptoms of depression and anxiety; data are captured by questionnaires and a 6-minute walk test performed in the outpatient clinic. Secondary outcomes are cognition, heart rate, blood pressure, sleep and physical activity. Interviews are also conducted before and after the intervention with all patients.",

Thus, data collection for many ongoing studies has been suspended or reorganised using alternative data collection methods. This situation has far-reaching consequences for the timelines of many research projects. Given the uncertain timeline of the pandemic and the rate at which hospitals will resume usual activities, it is unknown when patient recruitment and data collection can be resumed or organised as originally intended. For APPROACH-IS II, the decision was made initially to pause data collection for three months for regions affected by the virus; this timeline will be revisited regularly and will be extended if appropriate. As the Tele-yoga study is a randomised trial with predetermined follow-up points, it was not reasonable to suspend data collection for patients already enrolled in the trial (whether currently receiving the intervention or in the follow-up phase). Alternative data collection methods are being considered, such as performing the walk test at home, sending an activity monitor by mail, and assessing cognitive function over the telephone. The timing of the resumption of study recruitment will be consistent with guidelines from Sweden's Ministry of Health.",

            "text": "The main outcomes of APPROACH-IS II are PROs, including anxiety and depression symptoms, which are increasingly present during infectious outbreaks. [7] [8] [9] Other APPROACH-IS II questions pertain to social support, parental support and advance care planning, of which responses would expect to be impacted by social restrictions and isolation accompanying the current pandemic. Thus, it would be extremely challenging to know whether responses to PRO measures reflect patients' histories of living with congenital heart disease, which was the intent of the study, or instead reflect responses to current pandemicassociated stressors. Therefore, the risk of biased data was the second reason that APPROACH-IS II researchers opted to recommend the suspension of data collection. Furthermore, there will be challenges determining the optimal time to resume data collection, given that the lifestyle and psychosocial impact of the pandemic (and therefore PROs) are likely to extend beyond the pandemic's duration for many individuals. 10 For this reason, the date of survey completion will be collected and considered within statistical analyses. Yet, this will still be challenging, because PROs may fluctuate depending of the severity of the outbreak at that time. 11 The Tele-yoga study will face similar challenges interpreting patient-reported health-related quality of life and symptoms of depression and anxiety during these challenging times. In addition, in the Tele-yoga intervention, patient engagement may vary during the pandemic. For example, patients in the intervention group might engage more with the yoga instructor during online sessions as a means of increasing social connections. Depending on the impact on their employment and parenting, patients might have more or less time to engage in daily independent yoga practice. Another unanticipated change in the intervention is the reduced quality of the online live streaming service used for twice-weekly yoga sessions because the use of such platforms by the general public has increased exponentially during the pandemic. It will, therefore, be important to incorporate the timing of the intervention (before, during or after the pandemic) within statistical analyses. It will also be important for researchers to address the shift in data collection methods, namely from primarily in-clinic to at-home assessments, when interpreting study results.",
