We examined moderation by parent gender, education, family income, and coparenting conflict. We found large deteriorations from before the pandemic to the first months of the pandemic in child internalizing and externalizing problems and parent depression, and a moderate decline in coparenting quality. Smaller changes were found for parent anxiety and parenting quality. Mothers and families with lower levels of income were at particular risk for deterioration in wellbeing. Results indicate a need for widespread family support and intervention to prevent potential family \"scarring,\" that is, prolonged, intertwined individual mental health and family relationship problems.",

Although low parent education/income is linked to lower levels of family member well-being in general, it is unclear how these risk factors would predict change in wellbeing during a high-stress period such as the pandemic. It is possible that well-being among those with elevated levels of risk may already be so low that additional pandemicrelated stressors have little additional influence. It may also be possible that pandemic-related stress is sufficiently severe such that it swamps the impact of pre-existing risk / 3 factors, leading to generally similar, low levels of well-being during the pandemic regardless of pre-existing risk. We hypothesize, however, that both pre-existing and pandemicperiod risk factors will be salient, and that lower parent education/income and higher prepandemic coparenting conflict will exacerbate the negative impacts of the pandemic (i.e., leading to relatively greater declines in well-being).",

Parents were eligible for the trial if they were at least 18 years of age and resided together. 399 primiparous mother and father dyads enrolled; after four waves of data were collected between pregnancy and 4 years postpartum, 384 parents from 208 families participated in a final wave of pre-pandemic data (2017) (2018) (2019) (2020) . In April and May 2020, we offered participants an opportunity to complete an online questionnaire regarding adjustment during the pandemic. Respondents to this online questionnaire included 122 mothers and 84 fathers from 129 families with an average 2.3 children (SD = 1.0; range = 1-5). The oldest child in each family (45.6% female) was an average of 9.9 years (SD = 1.0); mothers and fathers were 39.5 (SD = 4.4) and 41.2 years (SD = 4.7), respectively. Parents completed an average of 15.9 years of education (SD = 1.3). 95% of participants reported they continued to live with the partner with whom they enrolled in the study originally. Reflecting the original recruitment area, 94.7% of parents were non-Hispanic white; thus, generalizations from this data should be made with caution. No significant differences were found in attrition from Time 1 (the last wave of data collected before the pandemic) to Time 2 (pandemic) by intervention condition, education, income, or race/ethnicity.",

Time (prepandemic = 0, pandemic = 1), parent gender (mothers = 0, fathers = 1) and intervention condition (control = 0, intervention = 1), and the parent gender by time interaction were included in all models. We assessed whether to include the time interval between assessments by examining correlations between time interval and absolute change in individual and family functioning. Results demonstrated that differences observed in most of the outcome variables between pre-pandemic and pandemic waves were not significantly correlated with time interval (rs = \u00c0.10 to .07). The exception was externalizing behaviors where the correlation was significant but small (r = \u00c0.20, p = .05). Results of analyses for externalizing behaviors controlling for time interval were not different than when time interval was not included; therefore, we present the models without time interval as a control variable.",

These lower-risk parents, as one might expect, had lower levels of depression before the pandemic relative to higher-risk parents. Thus, whereas both lower-and higher-risk parents experienced increases in depression with the pandemic, the increases for lowerrisk parents were larger and brought their levels of depression closer to the levels reported by higher-risk parents. In this case, the acute stress of the pandemic partly or wholly \"swamped\" the effect of pre-existing risk (i.e., lower education or higher coparenting conflict) on depression. Although in many ways the pandemic has highlighted disparities in health and vulnerability in our population, in this sample at least, the pandemic may have reduced disparities in parent depression.",

The plot of this interaction indicates that middle-income parents reported the lowest levels of parenting quality before the pandemic, and also reported the largest decreases in parenting quality with the pandemic. A speculative interpretation of these income moderation findings is that, at least in this sample, middle-income parents may have experienced high levels of stress and consequently depression before the pandemic due to a parenting style in which they feel compelled to invest considerable time, energy, and financial resources to promote children's well-being through numerous enrichment activities and high levels of parent involvement (Vincent & Ball, 2007) . These middle-income parents, who do not have the financial resources of wealthy parents that allow one to hire others to perform household or childcare duties, may expend considerable internal resources in maintaining positive, supportive parenting toward their child despite their own elevated levels of stress. With the additional strains brought on by the pandemic, these middle-income parents' ability to self-regulate and maintain positive parenting in the face of their already higher levels of depression may have been most compromised. With regard to the pandemic itself, we suggest that future research examine the implications of deterioration in parent and child psychological well-being for physical health, especially regarding susceptibility to COVID-19. There are two pathways through which mental health and family relationship problems may affect susceptibility to the virus. In order to provide guidance for future investigations, we depict these pathways in a conceptual model (Figure 3) , including the pathways representing the impact of the pandemic on mental health and family relationships reported on in this paper. First, mental health problems and family conflict may compromise parents' abilities to implement and sustain family member protective health actions recommended by public health authorities (such as social distancing, seclusion in households, hand-washing, and mask-wearing (Feinberg et al., Under review) . As there is considerable variation in opinions about and deployment of protective health behaviors in the United States (Gollwitzer et al., 2020; Simonov, Sacher, Dub e, & Biswas, 2020) , it is likely that many parents do not completely agree with each other about the necessity of such practices. Evidence in other contexts indicates that monitoring and guiding children's behavior are compromised when parents are unable to resolve coparenting conflict (Feinberg, 2003) . In addition to influencing exposure to the virus, psychosocial stress, depression, and interpersonal conflict may increase susceptibility to infection and the severity of the resulting illness upon exposure. Evidence indicates that stress, depression, and conflict reduce the healthy immune response to virus infections-likely mediated by dysregulation of inflammatory responses to virus exposure (Cohen, 2020) . This pathway is of particular note given that recent research has documented the influence of immune functioning and \"cytokine storms\" on severity of the COVID-19 illness (Ragab, Eldin, Taeimah, Khattab, & Salem, 2020) .",

Although there was a wide range of income and we found moderation of change in well-being by income, median income was at the 69th percentile of the U.S. distribution-toward the higher end of the middle-income range spanning from the 30th to 81st percentiles (Kochhar, 2018) . 95% of respondents were in two-parent families (the focus of the original study was on couples at the transition to parenthood), and these results are not generalizable to single-parent families. An additional limitation of this study is that we examined change across time, but we were unable to compare change in these families to a sample of families who did not experience the pandemic. However, there is little evidence that mental health and the quality of family relationships deteriorate to a substantial degree over the period of family development (in terms of the age of the oldest child) examined here. With the data presented in this report, we are unable to assess whether family member adjustment recovered in the following months of the pandemic; this is a question we plan to investigate in the future. Finally, our measure of child adjustment was reported on by parents, and thus may be subject to reporter bias; however, most measures of child adjustment in the literature are based on the report of an informant (e.g., teacher or parent vs. direct observation or archival records of school suspensions or arrests). Increasing the reliability typically requires triangulation across informants; but with schools and activities operating remotely during the time when the data were collected, there were no other informants capable of rating child adjustment across families.",

Proc., Vol. x, xxxx, 2021 FEINBERG ET AL. / 11 (Fontanesi et al., 2020) . One intervention strategy would be to promote individual and family resilience before a crisis period. For example, recent findings from a randomized trial suggest that a universal, couple-focused, preventive intervention at the transition to parenthood resulted in better parent, child, and family well-being during the pandemic, 10 years after program implementation (Feinberg, Under review; Feinberg, Jones, Roettger, Solmeyer, & Hostetler, 2014) . A second strategy would be to provide support to families after the onset of a crisis. Such intervention should promote better coping skills, mood management, family relationship quality, and accessing of social support. An efficient strategy for supporting families in a period of acute stress would focus on positive coparenting (Feinberg, 2002) -that is, parents' mutual support and childrearing coordination. Empirical and experimental evidence demonstrates that coparenting quality plays a critical role in supporting parent mental health, positive parenting quality (Prime, Wade, & Browne, 2020) , and children's adjustment ; Figure 1 ). An evaluation of a coparenting-focused, telehealth intervention delivered in Australia during the pandemic suggests that this approach is acceptable to and beneficial for parents and families (Giallo, Seymour, & Feinberg, Under review) .",

            "text": "Based on our findings of large negative impacts of the pandemic on parent and child well-being, we believe it is important to consider the possibility of these negative impacts persisting after the pandemic. This is analogous to the possibility raised by economists that severe disruption in businesses and financial markets might \"scar\" the economy that make it hard for recovery to take hold. We suggest that similar scarring may take place within families; after a decline in inter-related factors such as parent mental health, child adjustment, coparenting, and parenting quality, initial increases in well-being in one area may be undermined by persisting problems in another. For example, research suggests that parent depression and coparenting quality are in particular reciprocally linked (Feinberg, 2003; Tissot, Favez, Frascarolo, & Despland, 2016) , and indeed these two factors were substantially linked (r's = .39-.58) in our data. The inter-relatedness of depression and coparenting creates the potential for a vicious cycle of increasing depression leading to coparenting conflict leading to more severe depression. If one parent began to experience reduced depression after the pandemic, it is possible that a dynamic of coparenting conflict would persist and undermine such gains. Likewise, the alleviation of child-related stressors (e.g., opening of schools and extracurricular activities) may not lead to improved coparenting quality if one or both parents remain depressed and parenting quality remains compromised.",

Assisting families in recovering from the pandemic period may require multicomponent, inter-disciplinary approaches by schools, counselors, mental health clinicians, pediatricians, family service agencies, faith-based congregations, and youth-serving recreational and athletic organizations. Thus, it will be important to follow families' as the pandemic and screen for persistence of disruptions in parent and child well-being.",
