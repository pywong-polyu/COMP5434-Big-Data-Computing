We aim to report our experience in children with COVID-19 presenting with suspected intussusception imaged with ultrasound. Methods Children under 18 years who had an ultrasound for possible intussusception underwent retrospective analysis and were tested for COVID-19 between April 1 and December 14, 2020. Patients' demographic, clinical, radiological and surgical characteristics were reviewed. Results Twenty-four COVID-19-positive patients were identified; 19 boys with mean age 3 years (range: 3 months-18 years). Ultrasound was abnormal in 11 patients (11/24, 46%). Sonographic features of enterocolitis were documented in seven children (7/24, 29%). Three boys (3/24, 13%) were found to have ileocolic intussusception on ultrasound and underwent air enema with failed reduction (3/3, 100%), precipitating surgical reductions, all with favorable outcomes. One patient (1/24, 4%) was found to have a long segment of persistent small bowel-small bowel intussusception which was surgically repaired. Conclusion Given the known association between failed reduction at air enema and delayed presentation, heightened awareness for intussusception in the setting of COVID-19 should be maintained, though more often, the etiology was attributed to other GI manifestations of COVID-19.",

Delay in diagnosis secondary to delayed presentation will lead to delay in providing the adequate non-invasive treatment through enema reduction and increase risk of failure. Increased risk of requiring surgical reduction and bowel resection has previously been reported with symptom duration exceeding 24-48 h [11, 12] . All three patients with failed reduction in our cohort presented to the emergency department 24 to 96 h (mean 56 h) after experiencing GI symptoms, which may account for our failure rate.",

Specifically, most COVID-19-associated intussusception cases have been successfully treated with non-surgical reduction [3, 4, 6, 7] . There was only one reported case of failed pneumatic enema reduction requiring surgical intervention which also identified malrotation and was treated with both intussusception reduction and a Ladd's procedure [5] . The symptom duration in these patients ranged between 30 and 96 h (mean 55.5 h) which is similar to the range and mean symptom duration of our patients, suggesting that delayed presentation is not the only factor accounting for our failed reduction rate. We do not think it likely that our failed reduction rate was related to radiologist concern over patient COVID-19-positive status since the enema reduction fluoroscopic time ranged between 16 and 21 min (mean 18 min) with multiple attempts, which is much higher than established ranges for enema reduction, reported previously in the literature at 4.9 min for failed procedures [13] .",

The pathophysiology involves the formation of lymphoid hyperplasia of Peyer's patches in the ileum as well as the presence of inflammatory neuropathy secondary to intestinal nervous plexus lymphocytic infiltration leading to abnormal bowel peristalsis which in turns causes bowel telescoping into each other [18] . Although it is not documented, the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-related intussusception may also be similar to what is seen with adenovirus. Furthermore, the intestinal epithelial cells express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) enzyme which mediate the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Enterocyte neuronal cells also express ACE-2 receptors [19, 20] which might also explain COVID-19 GI infection in our cohort, since almost 30% of children had sonographic evidence of enterocolitis. This is beyond the scope of this report, but suggests further area for study, including pathologic analysis of the bowel in cases where bowel may be compromised and resection performed.",

Specifically, the cohort of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases is small, and therefore, the ability to draw statistical inference from the available demographic and clinical data of the three children with intussusception is limited. In addition, there is large difference in patient numbers between SARS-CoV-2-positive (n = 24) versus SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (n = 403) who were imaged for intussusception limiting the ability to run an accurate statistical comparison between these two groups. While our group noted more variable diagnoses on ultrasound imaging of SARS-CoV-2-negative patients versus SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, this can be explained by the larger number of imaged SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. While the failure rate of enema reduction in patients who tested negative for COVID-19 and had intussusception during the same period of time (17%) is close to the known failure rate in our institution (13.9%) [10] , it is vastly different from the failure rate in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (100%). This significant difference in patients' outcome after fluoroscopic enema needs further evaluation with a larger cohort of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with intussusception to assess for possible demographic and clinical factors playing a role in failure of enema reduction. Furthermore, our institution was not performing strain analysis during the study period to check for any possible propensity of a particular variant for GI involvement in children. Multi-institutional longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the association between SARS-CoV-2 and GI disease, not limited to intussusception, in the pediatric population.",
