In recent years, clonal hematopoiesis (CH) of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has emerged as a risk factor for chronic inflammatory background and subsequent aging-associated diseases. The purpose of this study was to identify biological factors (particularly leukocyte subtypes and inflammatory markers) associated with a risk of clinical deterioration (i.e., orotracheal intubation (OTI)) and to determine whether CH was likely to influence clinical and biological behavior in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Here, we describe clinical and biological features, including the screening of CHIP mutants in a well-annotated cohort of 122 hospitalized patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (55% requiring OTI). We showed that elevated white blood cell counts, especially neutrophils and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at admission, were associated with an increased requirement of OTI. We noticed a high prevalence of CH (25%, 38%, 56%, and 82% of patients aged <60 years, 60-70 years, 70-80 years, and >80 years) compared to a retrospective cohort of patients free of hematological malignancy explored with the same pipelines (10%, 21%, 37%,",

Although a large proportion of affected patients present with little or mild flu-like symptoms, the disease may cause severe or fatal complications in some people. This has led to research efforts to identify people at higher risk of severe illness and death. Advanced age or preexisting diseases, such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, or cancers, have been characterized as risk factors for severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization and intensive care [1] . Severe complications have been attributed, at least in part, to hyperinflammation and inappropriate cytokine release [2] . Serum profiling of COVID-19 patients has revealed a distinct inflammatory response characterized by high levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and reduced type I interferon [3] .",

This condition, named clonal hematopoiesis (CH) of indeterminate potential (CHIP), implies that genes recurrently mutate in myeloid hematological malignancies, among which the master epigenetic regulators DNA-methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and its partner Tet-methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) are the most frequently involved [8] . The etiology, biological impact on hematopoiesis, and evolution of individuals with CHIP currently represent notable fields of research. Case control studies have shown that CHIP was associated with a higher risk of hematological cancer [4, 5] , as expected, but also with an increase in incident coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality [4, 9, 10] , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [6, 7] . Interestingly, further studies have suggested a connection between cytokine-mediated processes and CHIP [6, 9, [11] [12] [13] [14] , with higher serum IL-6 [15] and C-reactive protein (CRP) [16] levels in CHIP carriers. Studies using murine models have also demonstrated that Dnmt3aand Tet2-deficient animals were characterized by impaired production of type I interferon and increased IL-6 production, respectively, compared to wild-type mice [12, 17] .",

A high depth of coverage (>1500 X) was obtained for all CHIP-associated genes [4] in this panel ( Figure S1 ) and mutations were detected until a filtered VAF of 1.5%-2% was obtained, with at least 20 reads carrying the variant (Table S1 ). The median depth of coverage was 3720 X and 2629 X for DNMT3A and TET2 full genes, respectively.",

Additional in silico predictions were performed when possible. Frameshift and nonsense variants were always considered as relevant mutations. Single nucleotide variant effects on protein function were predicted using SIFT (Sorting Tolerant from Intolerant) and PolyPhen-2. The effects of splicing variants were predicted with Human Splicing Finder version 3.1. Additional criteria for the classification of variants as somatic driver mutations are given in Table S2 . The exclusion of sequencing artifacts was performed by estimating the sequencing noise at identified variants' positions in other DNA samples. No variants identified in the present study were found in 65 serial sequencings of a commercial genomic negative DNA (CytoScan\u2122 Reagent Kit Components, Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Since genetic background and polymorphisms could give rise to some artifacts, we also ensured that no identified variants were found more than expected in a series of 4240 DNA samples from patients suspected of myeloid malignancies (Table S3 ). Finally, in 9 patients with identified variants (12 different somatic mutations), we repeated the sequencing in another sample (DNA sampled on the day of admission, i.e., between 7 and 16 days before the first analysis) and confirmed the results ( Figure S2 ).",

Among these patients, 89 (73%) were transferred to the ICU during hospitalization and 67 (55%) required OTI. Twenty-two (18%) and six (5%) patients experienced venous thromboembolic disease (pulmonary embolism, n = 18; deep vein thrombosis, n = 4) and arterial disease (strokes, n = 4; myocardial infarction, n = 2), respectively. At the time of this report, 95 patients were cured (defined by discharge from the hospital), 17 died (mortality rate: 15%), and 10 were still hospitalized. High levels of white blood cell count (WBC), especially neutrophils and C-reactive protein, were associated with more severe forms, defined by an increased requirement of OTI ( Figure 1) A total of 91 mutations were found in 55 individuals (45% of the whole cohort) (Figure 2A ,B, Table S4 ). DNMT3A and TET2 mutations were by far the most common, concerning 28 (23%) and 26 patients (21%), respectively. Overall, mutations in DNMT3A and/or TET2 were present in 36% (44/122) of COVID-19 patients and were found in 80% (44/55) of those with CH. Ten patients had both DNMT3A and TET2 mutations. Other recurrently mutated genes included ASXL1 (n = 7; 6%) and TP53 (n = 5; 4%). The average number of detected mutations among patients with CH was one (range, 1-5). The median variant allele frequency (VAF) was 2% ( Figure 2C ), but 10 patients had mutations with VAFs higher than 10% (none of them were known to have a hematological malignancy). Particular attention was paid to other CBCs during management, especially for the existence of monocytosis, blasts or evolution of cytopenias. None of them had additional argument for an active malignancy. As expected, CH was more frequent in elderly people, and its prevalence increased with age ( Figure 2D ). CH affected 25%, 38%, 56%, and 82% of patients aged <60 years, 60-70 years, 70-80 years, and >80 years, respectively. The median age of CH-positive and CH-negative patients was 72 years and 60 years, respectively (p < 0.001). Laboratory values from CBC and inflammatory markers did not differ significantly between CH-positive and CH-negative patients (Table 1, Figure S3 ). Serum levels of IL-6 in patients with available material were not different between CH-positive vs. CH-negative, DNMT3A-positive vs. DNMT3A-negative, and TET2-positive vs. TET2-negative patients.

Univariate analyses showed no significant difference in outcome, clinical symptoms, or comorbidities between the two groups, except for myocardial infarction and obliterative arterial disease, which were reported more frequently in the medical history of CH-positive patients (p = 0.046). Intriguingly, OTI requirement was less frequent in patients with DNMT3A mutations (10/28 (36%) vs. 57/94 (61%) in mutated vs. unmutated; OR = 0.361, 95% CI: 0.150-0.867, p = 0.023) but the small size of our cohort and the absence of a validation cohort do not allow for further speculations.

However, it is important to note that different panels, sequencing technologies, or bioinformatics pipelines may introduce biases in the sensitivity threshold of CH detection, thereby greatly limiting such comparisons. This may in part be related to a broader TET2 coverage in the present study. Additionally, it should be noted that certain regions, including the ASXL1 hotspot, are prone to technical artifacts with IonTorrent sequencing platforms, which could have limited ASXL1 mutant detection in our study. Finally, individuals in our retrospective cohort should not be considered as healthy people since most of them had unexplained cytopenia. However, this would likely increase the prevalence of CH in our control population and therefore not affect the conclusions regarding the higher CH frequency in COVID-19 patients. We acknowledge that this finding may suffer from several biases, including the absence of sampling prior to COVID-19, the relatively small size of the studied group, and the absence of matched controls for confounding factors including comorbidities. Notably, the impact of acute inflammatory states on CH (possibly affecting clone selection or expansion) in COVID-19 patients remains unknown. Indeed, it has been suggested that the emergence of CH (especially TET2 mutants) may be facilitated in response to inflammatory stress [22, 23] . Given the lack of samples collected prior to COVID-19 infection and in non-hospitalized patients, we were not able to determine whether the high frequency of CH in these patients could be associated with a higher rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 or reflect a consequence of the acute inflammatory state. Additionally, although all biological and clinical were prospectively collected and reviewed, we could not exclude the existence of other undiagnosed pathological conditions in our patients. Overall, we show that CH does not significantly impact clinical and biological findings in COVID-19 patients or outcomes, including OTI or death. Given that 75% of CH variants were identified with a VAF below 5%, it was expected that this would have little or minimal clinical consequence. Due to the low number of individuals presenting with larger clones, we were not able to perform analyses regarding higher VAF cutoffs.",
