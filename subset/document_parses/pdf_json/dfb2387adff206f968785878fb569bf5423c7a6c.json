Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among registered members of the Saudi Society for Rheumatology. The questionnaire focused on biosimilars and NMS. Logistic regression was performed to ascertain the effect of demographics and practice characteristics on the use of biosimilars and NMS. Results: Out of 249 SSR members, 143 completed the survey, generating a response rate of 57.4%. Of those (59.44%) were men with a mean (\u00b1SD) age and years of practice of 42.3 \u00b1 9.13 and 10.3 \u00b1 8.9, respectively. Rheumatologists managing adult patients (81.82%) and Ministry of Health practice (43.36 %) were the majority of respondents. Previous experience in prescribing a biosimilar was reported by 43 (30.07%) participants, with a higher probability among women (p = 0.015). A total of 26 (18.18%) participants had performed NMS on eligible patients. Adequate knowledge on biosimilars was reported by 69 (48.25%) participants. The adequacy of evidence to grant biosimilar approval for the studied indication and extrapolation to treat other conditions was reported by 88 (61.5%) and 69 (48.3%), respectively. The concept of totality-of-the-evidence was well understood by 37.1%. Biosimilars had been previously used by 43 (30.07) participants in their practice. NMS had been attempted by 26 (18.18), while 86 (60.1%) participants believed that NMS might harm patients. Conclusion: There is a clear knowledge gap about the biosimilar approval process among adult and pediatric rheumatologists who took part in the survey. In addition, a large number of participants reported having negative opinions about NMS. There is a need to organize SSR-led educational activities, and develop national guidelines regarding biosimilars and NMS.",

            "text": "Rheumatic diseases are associated with a significant burden on patients and the community in Saudi Arabia . Biologics have led to a dramatic improvement in the long-term outcomes of patients with rheumatic diseases; however, this has come with an increase in direct costs to health care systems (Curtis and Singh, 2011) . The introduction of biosimilars to the clinical practice of rheumatology has led to significant cost savings and improved access to treatment with biologics in many countries (Baumgart et al., 2019) . biosimilars have been observed worldwide. This could be related to economic pressures, heterogeneity of regulatory procedures, and differences in strategies on how to introduce biosimilars into health systems (Kim et al., 2020) . All of these factors apply to the Middle East region; which faces many healthcare-related challenges, and has been shown to have a varying acceptance of biosimilars (El Zorkany et al., 2018) . Due to a lack of national guidelines, the levels of understanding and use of biosimilars in Saudi Arabia are low, and need to be addressed (Halabi et al., 2018) . Rheumatologists are important stakeholders who play a critical role in facilitating biosimilar uptake. When switching from a familiar biologic therapy to a biosimilar therapy is undertaken, adequate communication with patients and caregivers, assessment of the continuity of medical care, and verification of the development of adverse events are main support tasks that need to be completed. Previous studies in other countries have uncovered some concerns and issues regarding the use of biosimilars that are primarily the result of an incomplete understanding of biosimilar manufacturing and approval processes Omair et al., 2017) . The main obstacles to complete understanding that have been reported are as follows: 1) comprehension of the concept, totality-of-the evidence; 2) extrapolation to all approved indications based on successful clinical trials in a model disease; and 3) inadequate long-term safety and efficacy data (Alten, 2015) .",

Prior to the approval of biosimilars in Saudi Arabia in 2015, we conducted a survey on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment strategies. Of the 54 participants in that study, 26.3% used biosimilars prior to originators (Omair et al., 2017) , whereas in the current study, we showed that about 60% of respondents indicated they are currently ready to start using biosimilars for treatment. We also conducted a study on Arab rheumatologists during a regional meeting held in 2018 and found that only 30% of participants expressed that they were either definitely or highly likely to prescribe a biosimilar to an eligible patient. The timing of this study, during the COVID-19 pandemic, is associated with increased economic pressure on the healthcare system and a shortage of medications. This might impacted the responses of participants. There is currently an increasing demand for biosimilars, especially with the economic impact of COVID-19 that has affected the medical supply chain across the world. This has led to drug shortages, which in turn may mandate the development of guidelines on the use of biosimilars and NMS.",

An inadequate understanding of the differences in the biosynthesis of biosimilars compared to their originators and the reversed ratio of preclinical/clinical regulatory requirements are two important shortcomings that impacted the perception of the rheumatologists responding to our survey. This might have led to unacceptance and an increased risk of the nocebo effect (Barsky et al., 2002) .

However, the FDA in the United States and the European Medicine Agency have not required additional studies focused on children and young people (Aragon Cuevas and Hedrich, 2020) . This has led individual centers to develop committees to evaluate the needs and challenges of adopting biosimilars in children (Aragon Cuevas and Hedrich, 2020) . Most of the current realworld evidence on prescribing biosimilars or performing NMS has been published as abstracts or is pending publication. Most pediatric rheumatologists practicing in Saudi Arabia are working in tertiary care centers.
