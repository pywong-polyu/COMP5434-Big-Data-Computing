This study aimed to explore the occurrence and prognosis of DAH after allo-HSCT, in addition to comparing discrepancies in the incidence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of DAH between patients undergoing haploidentical HSCT (HID-HSCT) and matched related donor HSCT (MRD-HSCT). We retrospectively evaluated 92 consecutive patients among 3987 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of DAH following allo-HSCT (HID: 71 patients, MRD: 21 patients). The incidence of DAH after allo-HSCT was 2.3%, 2.4% after HID-HSCT and 2.0% after MRD-HSCT (P = 0.501). The prognosis of patients with DAH after transplantation is extremely poor. The duration of DAH was 7.5 days (range, 1-48 days). The probabilities of overall survival (OS) were significantly different between patients with and without DAH within 2 years after transplantation (P < 0.001). According to the Cox regression analysis, a significant independent risk factor for the occurrence of DAH was delayed platelet engraftment (P < 0.001), and a high D-dimer level (>500 ng/ml) was a significant risk factor for the poor prognosis of DAH. HID-HSCT is similar to MRD-HSCT in terms of the outcomes of DAH.",

DAH is defined as an acute onset of hypoxemia, dyspnoea and/or haemoptysis, while chest radiographs reveal new or aggravated diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, according to previous studies [3, 6, 7] . Previous studies have indicated that the presence of progressive bloody bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on bronchoscopy is one of the conditions for the diagnosis of DAH [6] [7] [8] [9] . The pathological mechanism of DAH after bone marrow (BM) transplantation is unclear. According to previous studies, DAH may be related to the failure of neutrophil and platelet transplantation [3] , direct or indirect damage to the lungs caused by acute graftversus-host disease (aGVHD) [7] , infection [10] , toxicity of the conditioning regimen [5] and the cytokine storm [11] . Despite the rapid administration of prophylactic antibiotics, systemic glucocorticoid therapy and supportive care, the mortality rate of DAH amounts to 80-100% [3, 4, 12] . Consequently, the elucidation of the aetiology of DAH and effective treatment methods is urgently needed.",

Controls and patients were matched such that they would be comparable in terms of the details of HSCT and corresponding medical and nursing measures. \"The length of follow-up\" referred to the follow-up time after patients received a stem cell infusion.

The blood samples of patients with fever were submitted for the cytological and microbiological examinations mentioned above. In this study, DAH was defined as an acute onset of hypoxemia, dyspnoea, and/or haemoptysis with chest radiographs revealing new or aggravated diffuse pulmonary infiltrates [3, 6, 7] . The diagnosis of DAH was established based on the following criteria: (1) acute attack of hypoxemia, dyspnoea, and/or haemoptysis [3, [8] [9] [10] ; (2) existence of diffuse pulmonary infiltration on chest radiographs [4, 6, 7, 16] ; (3) presence of progressively bloodier return with each subsequent bronchoalveolar lavage [4, 10, 17] ; (4) no microorganisms isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [6, 7] ; and (5) no evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema detected by clinical manifestations, central venous pressure measurements, or echocardiography [9, 18] . The medical records of each patient were reviewed by a haematologist and a pulmonologist, ensuring that each patient included in the study met the diagnostic criteria for DAH.",

In addition, DAH is an important complication of both HID-HSCT and MRD-HSCT with an extremely poor prognosis. The incidence of DAH in HSCT recipients ranges from 3 to 8%, according to previous reports [23] . In the study by Kekre [3] , the authors classified all patients as having DAH, regardless of a documented infection from bronchoalveolar lavage. Our study excluded all patients in whom microorganisms were detected in the BALF. The incidence, risk factors, and prognosis were calculated based on patients with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage without microorganisms in the BALF. In our study, the cumulative incidence of DAH was 2.3%. The type of transplantation did not affect the incidence of DAH. Due to the lack of effective treatment strategies for DAH, the current method to improve the prognosis is to identify as many risk factors as possible and avoid their occurrence.",

Although none of the patients with DAH in our study were diagnosed with an infection, patients with fever still accounted for 29.3%, which is not significantly different from the proportion of patients with fever reported in the literature [5, 6, 16, 24] . This lack of difference may be due to inflammatory processes with neutrophil infiltration through the endothelial wall into the lung parenchyma [3, 25] , chemotherapyinduced mucositis [26] and other factors. In the multivariate analysis reported by SW Um, bleeding was identified as a risk factor for fever [27] . The mechanism of fever caused by bleeding is not very clear, and this mechanism may also be related to systemic and pulmonary inflammation evoked by haemorrhage [27] [28] [29] . Haem and other haemoglobin byproducts may function as ligands for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and TLR4 stimulation occurs first peripherally along with the recruitment of circulating macrophages and neutrophils and peripheral endothelial cells (EC) that produce PGE2, which leads to fever [30] [31] [32] .",

            "text": "We identified delayed platelet engraftment was an independent significant risk factor for DAH. Delayed platelet engraftment was also considered a risk factor for DAH in the study by Keklik [3] . Delayed platelet engraftment indicates long-term thrombocytopenia, which makes patients prone to bleeding. Although thrombocytopenia clearly leads to an increased risk of haemorrhagic disease after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, platelet supplementation does not effectively alleviate the progression of DAH [3, 33, 34] . The duration of platelet deficiency, but not the degree of platelet deficiency, may have a greater impact on the occurrence of DAH. DAH is increasingly postulated to be associated with EC damage [7, 11, 25, 35] , and delayed platelet engraftment indicates a higher intensity of myelosuppression [36] , which reflects the severity of EC damage to some extent [37] . Furthermore, a lower CD34+ dose has been shown to be associated with slower neutrophil engraftment and platelet engraftment [38, 39] . In our study, fewer CD34+ cells were infused in patients with DAH than in those without DAH, although the infusion of fewer CD34+ cells did not remain significant in the multivariate analysis. We suspect that delayed platelet engraftment is an important and indispensable component of the pathogenesis of DAH. A more precise prospective study is required to confirm this hypothesis, which will help improve the management of allogenic HSCT recipients. Severe acute GVHD, TMA, delayed neutrophil engraftment, myeloablative conditioning containing TBI and UCB HCT have also been reported as risk factors for DAH [3, 8, 40, 41] . However, these factors were not considered risk factors for DAH in our study. In the univariate analysis, the incidences of grade III-IV aGVHD after allo-HSCT were indeed significantly higher in the DAH group than in the non-DAH group. Endothelial cell (EC) damage caused by GVHD may explain this effect [42] . Early identification of high-risk patients and the implementation of appropriate precautions are meaningful for this life-threatening complication of DAH. The association of DAH with TMA has been infrequently reported [41] . DAH and TMA are both post-HSCT EC activation syndromes [11, 25, 35, 43] . Prolonged EC activation and damaging stimuli can lead to EC dysfunction, which is hypothesised to be critical in procoagulant, proinflammatory and proapoptotic responses that may result in early post-HCT complications [44] . The role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the pathogenesis of TMA and DAH has also been elucidated in previous studies. NETs cooperate with the injured endothelium to promote thrombosis in small vessels, leading to haemolysis, thrombocytopenia, poor end-organ perfusion, and ultimately, TA-TMA [45] . Little is known about the role of NETs in HSCTassociated DAH. Jarrot et al. suggested a pathogenic role of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and NETs in lung injury during pristane-induced DAH [46] . The treatment for DAH is often lacking and inadequate, which leads to rapid deterioration and high mortality rates for patients. DAH treatment is usually tentative and practical, including general supportive care (such as fluid and sodium management and mechanical ventilation), adequate prophylactic antibiotics and systemic glucocorticoids, sometimes with ACA and recombinant activated factor VII [3, 4, 8, 10, 12] . We found that patients receiving a low dose of glucocorticoids presented a better prognosis than those receiving a high dose, while in multivariate analysis, no dose of glucocorticoids played a significant role in determining the prognosis of patients with DAH, consistent with previous studies [3, 4, 8] . Based on these findings, a limitation of our study is that patients who were perceived to be sicker at the time of DAH diagnosis might have inherently been placed on higher doses of steroids by their treating physicians. Prospective, randomised trials are needed to compare the effects of different doses of glucocorticoids to confirm the appropriate therapeutic dose. In clinical practice, when to use steroids and the dose of steroids to use in patients with immune deficiency after HSCT have become great challenges to clinical workers, which requires more clinical research to guide the specialists in making decisions. Intubation and the use of noninvasive ventilators did not affect the prognosis of patients with DAH, consistent with previous reports [3, 6] showing that respiratory failure, possibly due to diffuse lung injury, cannot be corrected with oxygen support.",

We showed that a high D-dimer level (>500 ng/ml) was a significant risk factor for a poor prognosis of patients with DAH. In previous studies, high blood levels of D-dimer and low levels of fibrinogen at the onset of transplantation-related complications were significantly associated with EC damage. [47] [48] [49] Elevated D-dimer levels appear to be related to acute lung injury [50] . In summary, elevated D-dimer levels might be caused by EC injuries in the pulmonary capillaries, reflecting the severity of endothelial injury in DAH, which may be a risk factor for the poor prognosis of patients with DAH after HSCT.",

The nature of retrospective nested case-control studies determines their lack of statistical efficiency compared to large cohort studies. In conclusion, we showed that DAH is very difficult to treat, the disease progresses rapidly, and few effective treatment options are available, leading to a very poor OS rate. Haploidentical transplantation performed similarly to matched related donor transplantation in terms of outcomes related to DAH. Delayed platelet engraftment was suggested to be a risk factor for the occurrence of DAH. High D-dimer levels (>500 ng/ml) were a significant risk factor for the poor prognosis of patients with DAH. Medium doses of glucocorticoids may exert a certain effect, but do not alter the extremely poor prognosis of patients with DAH. Multicentre prospective studies are needed to further investigate practical methods for prophylaxis for DAH and effective therapeutic strategies, thereby improving the prognosis of patients with DAH.",
