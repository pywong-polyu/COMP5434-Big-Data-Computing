In this manner, the schools can guarantee these benefits to children, regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, and socio-economic status [2] .",

Consequently, a great number of children worldwide spent their daily activity at home with little access to structured activities, leaving schools to be the last bastion where PA is achievable. Sedentary attitude, due to lockdown, leads to adverse effects on children, such as mental swings, depression, and an impairment of the general health [3] . Epidemiological evidence has suggested that a sedentary lifestyle leads to an increasing risk of several clinical conditions [4] such as overweight [5] and cardiorespiratory impairments [6, 7] . Moreover, an additional PA practice leads to better coordination and cognitive functions [8, 9] . The link between PA and cognition is supported by evidence that cognitive and motor tasks activate the same neural regions [10, 11] . The overlap in the brain areas, responding to both motor and cognitive processes, may be the mechanisms by which, during PA, the involvement of prefrontal structures and arousal in the brain tissue were observed [12] .",

Only FIT significantly improved the math performance from pre-to post-assessment. Comparing the two experimental protocols, we found no significant differences, while only FIT showed significantly better results than CON. It has been shown that single bouts of PA (acute exercise) cause physiological arousal, facilitating the available attentional resources and the engagement of cognitive functioning [48] . It is possible that higher PA intensity levels in the cardiovascular condition contributed to higher scores. The cardiovascular protocol used music to provide the executive rhythm (music beats), and the work/rest ratio was correctly organized by the teacher. These conditions allowed children to reach a good level of exertion. It was previously shown that lasting fitness and cognitive effects, especially on attention, were obtained after more intense exercise intervention [49] . The rhythmic pumping of the hearth, in the concurrence between tempo of music and exercise, generates a similar resonant frequency in the brain, influencing the autonomic nervous system [50] . The use a synchronous rhythm between music and exercise could be the explanation for the cognitive functions' improvement [28] . In the creative protocol, the activity started from an event-telling and its dramatization, in order to promote the transition from the children's imaginative skill to the deliberate PA, giving the children support to try. In this protocol, the music was used only to elicit emotional experiences and positive affective regulation, since cognitive creativity is enhanced by listening to music during exercise [51] . As Runco [52] showed, creativity stimulates the divergent thinking, requiring finding new ideas in motor problem solving tasks more than promotion of high exertion. It was hypothesized that, despite these recognized benefits of creative tasks, the acute bout of this protocol probably did not reach the optimal intensity to promote better acute effects, such as the cardiovascular protocol. The time needed by the teachers to explain to the children the tasks and the execution modalities could have reduced the effective exertion time.",

The cardiovascular approach provides the highest results in term of short-term efficacy; the better time on/off of the cardiovascular protocol may have allowed the proper exercise volume (duration \u00d7 intensity). Nevertheless, it is possible that cardiovascular protocol, reply in a chronic administration, may lead to a loss of motivational impact or enjoyment. In contrast, the creative protocol may provide new stimuli and motivation improvements, since it provides a major engagement on cognitive performance. This report provided useful information for teachers to organize future active breaks between curricular lessons. As guidelines, an active break plane based on the turnover of creative and cardiovascular active break protocols in the same school day could be proposed. School in the present time represents the only one pillar to comply with the current WHO guidelines on the minimum PA dose per day for children. Promoting adequate levels of PA in children is a major public health issue.
