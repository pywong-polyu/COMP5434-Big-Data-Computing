Method: Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to explore the lived experience of nine women with PwM, who had sought psychological assessment/therapy. Participants were recruited via social media and completed semi-structured interviews online/via telephone. Results: Identified themes concerned two broad areas: (i) the challenges of having therapy whilst lacking memories and (ii) what was helpful in therapy. Challenges included: delayed help-seeking; having emotional/sensory reactions in the absence of recognisable triggers; experiencing therapy as more applicable to remembered trauma (vs. unremembered); and difficulty discussing and processing unremembered trauma. However, participants also described helpful aspects of therapy including: feeling safe and supported; working with emotional and sensory forms of experience; having scientific explanations for trauma and memory; and having 'permission' from therapists not to remember. Conclusions: Recommendations for clinicians included: being aware that clients with PwM may have more difficulty accessing treatment and perceive it as less applicable to them; focussing on clients' emotions and sensations (not cognitive memories) in therapy; and supporting clients to develop a more self-compassionate understanding of their experiences and lack of memory, thus supporting them to accept that not remembering is 'permitted'.",

Sin embargo, hay poca evidencia disponible sobre la provisi\u00f3n de tratamiento para esta poblaci\u00f3n. Objetivo: Este estudio tuvo como objetivo abordar esta brecha mediante la exploraci\u00f3n de las experiencias de las personas que han tenido una intervenci\u00f3n psicol\u00f3gica para TEPT sin recuerdos (PwM en su sigla en ingl\u00e9s). M\u00e9todo: Se us\u00f3 an\u00e1lisis fenomenol\u00f3gico interpretativo para explorar la experiencia vivida de nueve mujeres con PwM, quienes hab\u00edan buscado una evaluaci\u00f3n/terapia psicol\u00f3gica. Las participantes fueron reclutadas a trav\u00e9s de redes sociales y completaron entrevistas semiestructuradas en l\u00ednea o por tel\u00e9fono. Resultados: Los temas identificados se refer\u00edan a dos grandes \u00e1reas: (i) los desaf\u00edos de tener terapia mientras se carece de memoria; y (ii) lo que fue \u00fatil en la terapia. Los desaf\u00edos incluyeron: b\u00fasqueda de ayuda retardada; tener reacciones emocionales/sensoriales en ausencia de desencadenantes reconocibles; experimentar la terapia como m\u00e1s aplicable al trauma recordado (frente no recordado); y dificultad en discutir y procesar el trauma no recordado. Sin embargo, los participantes tambien describieron aspectos \u00fatiles de la terapia incluidos: sentirse seguros y apoyados; trabajar con formas de experiencia emocional y sensorial; tener explicaciones cient\u00edficas para el trauma y el recuerdo; y tener 'permiso' de los terapeutas para no recordar. Conclusiones: Las recomendaciones para el cl\u00ednico incluyeron: ser conscientes de que los clientes con PwM pueden tener m\u00e1s dificultades para acceder al tratamiento y percibirlo como menos aplicable a ellos; en la terapia centrarse en las emociones y sensaciones de los clientes (no en los recuerdos cognitivos); y apoyar a los clientes a desarrollar una comprensi\u00f3n m\u00e1s compasiva de sus experiencias y falta de recuerdos, apoyando as\u00ed que acepten que no recordar est\u00e1 'permitido'. Diagnostic criteria acknowledge that a degree of memory loss or fragmentation is often a characterising feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013, 5th ed.). However, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, 2018) states that interventions targeting PTSD should involve 'elaboration and processing of the trauma memories' (para. 1.6.17). The concept of reprocessing traumatic memories is also a core feature of the prevailing cognitive models of PTSD (Ehlers & Clark, 2000; Foa & Kozak, 1986) . Thus, best practice guidance appears to require the presence of memory to effectively treat PTSD.",

Survivors of trauma occurring after the typical period of amnesia may still experience memory impairments when the adverse experiences are chronic or multiple, due to repeated traumatisation in childhood increasing the likelihood of memory loss for some or all of these experiences (Brewin, 2012; Goodman, Gonzalves, & Wolpe, 2018) . For example, Briere and Conte (1993) found that frequency and duration of childhood sexual abuse were positively correlated with amnesia for the abusive experiences in adult survivors.

            "text": "Intrusive re-experiencing of the trauma event is commonly described as a core feature of PTSD (Ehlers et al., 2002) . However, intrusive, non-memory thoughts are also common in PTSD and may include evaluations of the consequences of the trauma and how it might have been prevented (Hackmann, Ehlers, Speckens, & Clark, 2004; Reynolds & Brewin, 1999) . For example, an individual who has no memory of a drug-facilitated sexual assault may still be aware that an assault took place (e.g. due to physical evidence) and may ruminate on the causes and consequences of the assault. Ehlers and Clark (2000) suggested that re-experiencing may also manifest as emotional or sensory reactions to trauma triggers, in the absence of cognitive memories. They termed this affect without recall and theorised that people may be unable to recognise this as a form of trauma memory. This was echoed by King (2001) who described 'affect without recollection' in TBI survivors presenting with PTSD. Similarly, Padmanabhanunni and Edwards (2013) describe 'somatic intrusions' (p. 374) in survivors of drug-facilitated sexual assault and suggested these represented non-visual intrusive memories. Gauntlett-Gilbert et al. (2004) described challenges arising in the treatment of drug-facilitated sexual assault survivors who experienced distressing sensory memories (e.g. smells) and were often preoccupied with attempts to recover cognitive memories. Anecdotally, they report exposure techniques were ineffective with these individuals and recommended targeting beliefs about memory.",

A full account of this debate is beyond the scope of this paper, and contrary to its aims. Based on the literature reviewed above, this study conceptualises the existence of PTSD without memories (PwM) as a phenomenon that occurs when individuals have experienced traumatic events which, due to a range of potential biological and developmental factors, they cannot recall or have only sensory remnants of. Awareness of the trauma, therefore, develops through experiencing the symptoms of PTSD, and potentially also from corroborating evidence (e.g. when people with TBI are aware they were involved in a traffic accident but can only remember the moments preceding the crash).",

Importantly, all participants reported having a mixture of remembered and unremembered trauma, largely in the context of multiple or chronic traumas. For example, some participants had experienced prolonged abuse in childhood and had memories of the more recent traumas but not of earlier ones. With regards to the absent memories, one participant reported no memory at all; and eight participants reported sensory memories only. The nature of the traumatic experiences that had led to PTSD without memories included: sexual violence in adulthood; childhood sexual abuse; witnessing domestic violence/family breakdown in childhood; exposure to acute parental distress in childhood; coercive control/honour-based violence; and traumatic experiences whilst detained under the mental health act. Although this was not explicitly asked in interviews, five of the nine participants reported some factual knowledge of events due to: family informing (P5); Note. ADHD = attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; ARFID = avoidant or restrictive food intake disorder; CBT = cognitive behavioural therapy; DID = dissociative identity disorder; EMDR = eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing; NHS = National Health Service; U.K. = United Kingdom; U.S.A. = United States of America. *Due to researcher error, participant ethnicity was not recorded at initial data collection. Participants were invited to provide this information post-analysis when findings were emailed to them; however, only six responded leading to incomplete ethnicity data. **All participants reported previous experiences of therapy prior to the most recent intervention.

This is consistent with our findings, wherein some participants described 'searching' for memories and endorsed beliefs that memory would simplify treatment. Approaches to PTSD treatment may inadvertently reinforce these beliefs. For example, a study published whilst this research was in-progress found that not writing a therapeutic trauma narrative resulted in greater maintenance of positive outcomes for survivors of drug-facilitated sexual assault (Jaffe, Kaysen, Smith, Galovski, & Resick, 2021) . They suggest that recall-focussed therapy may unintentionally highlight amnesia-related stuck points in PwM and maintain symptoms. Such evidence may partially account for why participants in this study found treatment less effective for unremembered trauma. However, not addressing memory gaps was also reported as unhelpful by participantswhich is consistent with trauma-informed care principles emphasising the importance of recognising traumatic experiences (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014).",

A safe and supportive space; accessing timely and sufficient treatment; the chance to make sense of one's story and to have scientific explanations for symptoms are all features that would likely characterise typical PTSD treatment (Ehlers & Clark, 2000; Ehlers, Clark, Hackmann, McManus, & Fennell, 2005; Sweeney, Clement, Filson, & Kennedy, 2016) . Less consistently provided (dependent on setting and therapist skill/experience) might be: flexible and personalised interventions; therapists acknowledging the challenges of treating PwM; explicit and permissive acknowledgement and explanation of unremembered trauma; and a focus on sensations and emotions as opposed to memory content. Having reported both desire for and ambivalence about recovering memories, participants in our study seemed to find 'permission' to accept nonrecovery of trauma memories was most helpful. Furthermore, having explanations for why they might lack memories enabled some to become less preoccupied with recall and develop more helpful and selfcompassionate coping strategies. This concurs with findings showing that psychoeducation can successfully challenge unhelpful interpretations of memory gaps in PwM (Padmanabhanunni & Edwards, 2013; Woodward, 2020) .",
