As cardiometabolic diseases are known risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes (13) (14) (15) (16) , it is possible that obesity may also act as a particularly important risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes in minority ethnic communities. Early research supports this hypothesis, in which the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, severe disease, and COVID-19 mortality in minority ethnic communities has been shown to be magnified in the presence of obesity (17, 18) , although this has not been confirmed in all studies (19) . However, evidence to date is preliminary and based on small cohorts with a limited number of outcomes, with minority ethnic groups analyzed as one category. As minority ethnic groups cover heterogeneous populations, it remains uncertain whether associations between obesity and COVID-19 outcomes differ in all minority ethnic groups or how they apply to national in-hospital settings.",

Obesity has been hypothesized to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 through mechanisms linked to restricted pulmonary function and chronic inflammation (2, (22) (23) (24) ; adipose tissue has also been suggested as a viral reservoir (23) . Patients from Black ethnicities may have greater inflammatory responses to infection (24) (25) (26) , and excessive systemic innate inflammation due to obesity (\"adipositis\") is associated with susceptibility to other infectious diseases (27) . Because both clinical and genetic evidence strongly suggests that inflammatory processes drive mortality in COVID-19 (28, 29) , these mechanisms may place Black ethnicities with obesity at a higher risk of organ failure and death. It is also possible that sociodemographic factors, such as greater levels of deprivation and discrimination, may also act through a host of different mechanisms to lower resilience to infection or delay admission to hospital (24) , which again could become more severe in the presence of obesity. However, further research is required to disentangle the mechanisms behind the observations reported in this paper.",

Although there was a high level of uncertainty in older minority ethnic populations due to a younger average age and the resulting limited sample of older adults, the findings are consistent with another in-hospital study in which associations of BMI with mortality or mechanical ventilation were largely attenuated in those over 70 years of age (30) . Therefore, the findings from this study may only be generalizable to those under 70 years of age, with ethnic specific associations in older adults needing further investigation. Obesity may also be a particularly strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes in otherwise healthy adults, where the highest odds of COVID-19 mortality with obesity was seen in Black ethnicities without other coexisting chronic diseases.",

However, there are some important limitations. Obesity was defined through clinician assessment, with the prevalence an underestimate compared with levels that would have been expected based on population estimates (31). Thus, the coding of obesity possibly reflects more extreme phenotypes of obesity that are likely to prompt a clinical coding, and it is unknown whether this procedure was biased by ethnicity. However, the pattern of obesity prevalence in this sample is broadly consistent with national survey data for overweight and obesity prevalence (32), with rates higher in Black ethnic groups but lower in other minority ethnic groups compared with White ethnicities. It is also important to note that, in order to inform clinical care, analyzed risk factors need to reflect data that are readily available to treating clinical staff through clinical records. Therefore, the coding of obesity in this study may have real-world utility as it corresponds to data collected within routine clinical care.

As such, it is acknowledged that the terms \"Black,\" \"South Asian,\" \"White,\" and \"other\" cover a wide range of different cultures and races. Consequently, our analyses may have masked important differences between further stratified ethnic groups. However, comparisons using these broad ethnic groupings are informative for understanding initial ethnic differences that can then be further and more granularly investigated. Finally, this analysis did not have access to potential sociodemographic confounders, such as deprivation, housing, or employment status. However, the purpose of this analysis was to highlight ethnic differences in the strength of obesity as a global risk factor for in-hospital outcomes following admission with COVID-19, rather than for supporting potential etiological conclusions around reducing levels of obesity per se.",
