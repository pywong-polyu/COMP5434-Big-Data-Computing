We aimed to evaluate cytokine profiles of mothers and their infants following COVID-19 in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Serum samples at delivery from 31 mother-infant dyads with maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy (COVID) were examined in comparison to 29 control dyads (Control). Samples were evaluated using a 13-plex cytokine assay. RESULTS: In comparison with controls, interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) were higher in COVID maternal and infant samples (p < 0.05) and IL-8 uniquely elevated in COVID infant samples (p < 0.05). Significant elevations in IL-6, IP-10, and IL-8 were found among both early (1st/2nd Trimester) and late (3rd Trimester) maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections throughout gestation are associated with increased maternal and infant inflammatory cytokines at birth with potential to impact long-term infant health.",

Throughout the pandemic, clinical studies have consistently shown that maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy generally does not result in vertical transmission from mother to infant [2] [3] [4] . While the rarity of vertical SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been well-characterized, the effects of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy on the developing fetus are less well defined. Of particular importance is the maternal immune activation and inflammation in response to SARS-CoV-2 which has significant potential to cause harm to the developing fetus. Indeed, inflammatory exposures during the perinatal period have been shown to impair infant growth and development in other disease processes [5] [6] [7] with a particular risk for alterations in brain development and cognitive function later in life [8] .",

While pregnant COVID-19 patients have a variety of clinical presentations, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy has been associated with increased COVID-19 disease severity and higher rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions when compared with COVID-19 in non-pregnant patients. Further, in comparison to pregnant patients without SARS-CoV-2 infections, pregnant patients with COVID-19 have an increased risk for preeclampsia and increased maternal mortality [11, 12] . Additionally, there is substantial evidence supporting intrauterine inflammation in pregnancies affected by maternal COVID-19 disease. Multiple studies have identified histological evidence of placental inflammatory lesions [13, 14] and male fetusspecific upregulation of placental interferon response genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines [15] .",

However, no study to date has characterized corresponding maternal and infant cytokine repertoires in larger cohorts, particularly from pregnancies with maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections in early pregnancy. Here we hypothesized that when compared to control pregnancies, SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and their infants have significant alterations in inflammatory cytokines and that these alterations vary by the gestational timing of maternal COVID-19. In the current study, serum cytokines were evaluated in mother-infant dyads by examining maternal blood and cord blood/infant blood at the time of delivery between SARS-CoV-2 positive and control pregnancies (i.e., contemporary patients negative for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery). In particular, we evaluated changes relative to the gestational timing of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

This panel was selected because it included cytokines previously identified to be altered among adult COVID-19 patients [9, 10] as well as cytokines associated with adverse long-term fetal outcomes in perinatal inflammatory exposures [5] [6] [7] [8] . Samples were pre-diluted 1:2 and the kit was run according to manufacturer's instructions. Sample data were collected using the Cytek\u00ae Aurora flow cytometer (Cytek Biosciences) in the Boston University School of Medicine Flow Cytometry Core facility. Cytokine concentrations for each sample were determined from extrapolation from standard curves using the LEGENDplex Data Analysis Software. Pilot testing of 20 cord blood and 20 infant blood samples indicated a very high correlation for this cytokine panel, thus these sample types were grouped together for the purposes of analysis as an \"infant\" sample for analysis of the full cohort.",

This is a non-parametric technique that estimates a probability distribution based on the number of samples below detected concentrations [20] . This method is preferred over simple substitution methods particularly when there is a large proportion of censored data. This Kaplan Meier method was used to calculate means and standard deviations separately within COVID and control groups and by sample type (maternal blood and cord/infant blood). Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals between the COVID and reference groups were then calculated for each cytokine within both maternal and cord/infant samples. We also examined differences between mean cytokine levels in maternal blood and cord blood/infant blood by timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Mean cytokine levels for early COVID (1st/2nd trimester) and late COVID (3rd trimester) were compared to each other and then to the reference group using t-tests for independent samples with unequal variances. Lastly, among the COVID-19 dyads, we calculated the correlation coefficient for individual cytokines between maternal and cord/ infant samples. All statistical analysis was performed using SAS software V9.4 (SAS Analytics). Graphical data for cytokine levels was created using Prism Software (Graphpad).",

These data also suggest a prolonged upregulation of these cytokines lasting weeks to months after disease onset as as only a small percentage (1%) had active symptoms at the time of delivery sample collection. The differing maternal-infant correlation profiles for IP-10, IL-6 and IL-8 between mothers and infants in the COVID cohort suggest that the infant cytokine elevations are not merely a passive transfer of maternal cytokines passing into fetal circulation. Rather, these changes may be the result of an independent fetal immune response to maternal SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy, as also suggested by a recent study showing evidence of fetal leukocyte activation in a cohort (n = 3) of cord blood samples from pregnancies affected by maternal COVID-19 in the third trimester [17] .",

Our data were congruent with these findings showing persistent IP-10 elevations in maternal and most significantly infant serum from early gestational COVID-19 infections. In pregnancy, elevated maternal IP-10 has been implicated in miscarriage and preeclampsia [23, 24] , but the long-term infant effects of IP-10 exposure in the perinatal period are currently undefined.",

Control: mothers with no report of COVID-19 disease at any time during their pregnancy and negative for SARS-CoV-2 at time of delivery screening.

Late COVID: mothers with SARS-CoV-2 positive testing in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy (28-41 weeks gestation). development. In preclinical studies, IL-6 is a central mediator of enhanced postnatal offspring intestinal inflammatory T cell activation following maternal perinatal infection [27] . Additionally, IL-6 and IL-8 elevations in pregnancy have independently been associated with altered infant neurodevelopmental outcomes [28, 29] , with prenatal exposures to IL-8 particularly implicated in the risk of schizophrenia later in life [30, 31] . The current study has several limitations. First, our cohorts were of moderate sample size and we did not evaluate a complete repertoire of COVID-19 related clinical variables (i.e., c-reactive protein levels, white blood cell count). As only a small subset of our cohort had these labs available, they were not included as part of this analysis. Our cohort also had a larger proportion of patients with maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections in early gestation as compared with late gestation. Ongoing analysis with larger cohorts will be required to characterize the cytokine profiles of early vs late pregnancy SARS-CoV-2 infections more completely.",

Indeed, of all our clinical parameters evaluated between control and COVID cohorts, the only value which reached statistical significance was an increase in fetal intrauterine growth restriction in the COVID cohort. As there was no accompanying difference in the incidence of preeclampsia, the growth restriction could be an early indicator of primary fetal pathology resulting from altered intrauterine physiology in response to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future studies involving more extensive patient cohorts and pre-clinical models will be required to characterize the driving mechanisms and developmental impact of the cytokine alterations identified in this study.
