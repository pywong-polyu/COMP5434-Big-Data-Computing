Both vaccines induced spike protein-specific effector T cells which were dominated by type 1 helper T cell responses following AZD1222 vaccination. A significant reduction of anti-inflammatory T cells upon re-stimulation was also restricted to AZD1222 vaccinees. While IgM and IgG were the dominant isotypes elicited by AZD1222, BNT162b2 led to a significant production of IgG and IgA.

Figure 3A shows representative data of CD19 + CD45RA + B cells and illustrates for a participant vaccinated with AZD1222 a shift of subpopulations expressing CD27 and CD38, respectively. While CD27 + CD38 bright plasmablasts were significantly enriched on day 6 following vaccination with AZD1222 and reached a median of 3.08%, a plasmablast peak after BNT162b2 vaccination was detectable on day 13, yet reached a median of 1.57% only (Fig. 3B , upper panels). The increase in plasmablasts after the AZD1222 vaccination was flanked by an increase in CD27 + CD38late memory B cells on days 13 and 20 Likewise, alterations among T cell subpopulations were restricted to AZD1222 vaccinees only (Additional file 1: Figs. S3 and S4). In detail, we detected a shift in the expression patterns of CD27 and CD38 on CD8 + cells especially 2 days after AZD1222 vaccination (Additional file 1: Fig. S3A ). This translated into a significant enrichment of CD27 -CD38 + terminally differentiated cytotoxic T cells for this group (Additional file 1: Fig.  S3B ). Additional file 1: Fig. S4A exemplifies for CD4 + cells a change in the expression patterns for CD27 and CD127 on day 20 after AZD1222 administration. We thus discovered that CD4 + CD127 -CD27 + effector memory T cells re-expressing RA (TEMRA) were enriched towards the end of the observation period (Additional file 1: Fig. S4B ). Taken together, we here demonstrated that significant changes among subpopulations of B-and T-lymphocytes were observed after vaccination with AZD1222 only.",

However, we assumed that both vaccines would on a small scale induce a specific cellular immune response towards the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which would become detectable upon re-stimulation with the antigen. We therefore used both, recombinant spike protein and BNT162b2 vaccine, and aimed to investigate cytokine profiles as well as the expression of inducible activation markers. In case of the recombinant spike protein, we expected it to be taken up by antigenpresenting cells (APCs). Upon processing the protein in lysosomes, respective peptides would predominantly become displayed on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules and thus would be ready to activate spike protein-specific T helper cells. By employing the mRNA vaccine, we anticipated its cellular uptake, translation into protein and then both, secretion for uptake by APCs and class II presentation as well as processing the protein for presentation via HLA class I molecules and thereby re-stimulating cytotoxic T cells [20] .",

Therefore, we cultured day 20 PBMCs from both vaccination groups in Fig. 3 Vaccination with AZD1222 and BNT162b2 induced significant yet transient alterations among peripheral plasmablasts.

In addition, both vaccines facilitated the expansion of inducible spike-specific cytotoxic effector T cells as demonstrated by significantly increased percentages of FasL + CD8 + cells after in vitro re-stimulation (Fig. 5B) . We further detected a significant increase in IFN\u03b3producing CD8 + T cells from AZD1222-but not from BNT162b2-vaccinated donors (p = 0.0325 vs 0.1514, Fig.  5C ).

To that extent, spike protein-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA were assessed for all time points via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As shown in Fig. 7A , Fig. 4 Spike-specific IFN\u03b3-producing lymphocytes were significantly increased after vaccination with BNT162b2. PBMCs were isolated at the day of vaccination (day 0) and 20 days later. Cells were then stimulated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for 24 h. Subsequently, an ELISPOT assay for the detection of IFN\u03b3-producing cells was performed. A Representative shots of spot-forming cells from individuals vaccinated with either AZD1222 (A9 and A12) or BNT162b2 (B4 and B20). PBMCs were stimulated with PMA as a positive control (bottom). B The counts of spot-forming cells from day 20 were normalized to counts from day 0. Data show the relative increase in IFN\u03b3 + cells after vaccination (n = 16 for AZD1222 and n = 15 for BNT162b2). p-values result from one-sample t-tests assessing the differences of group means to the hypothetical value of 1 both vaccines induced the production of detectable amounts of antibodies as early as day 13. However, significant differences emerged between AZD1222 and BNT162b2 vaccination concerning the distribution and amounts of spike-specific antibody isotypes. In detail, AZD1222 predominantly induced IgM and IgG, while IgA was virtually absent, even at day 20 after vaccination. In contrast, although not significantly different from AZD1222, BNT162b2 elicited little IgM. There were though increased IgG and IgA titers in BNT162b2vaccinated subjects and these differences reached statistical significance on day 20 for IgG and already on day 13 for IgA (Fig. 7A) . When looking at response rates instead of Ig titers, there were significantly more IgM and significantly less IgA responders to AZD1222 compared to BNT162b2 as calculated via Fisher's exact test (Additional file 1: Table  S3 ). When testing for surrogate virus neutralization, we found that SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain neutralization was 1.6-fold higher for BNT162b2 (median 784 IU/mL) when compared to AZD1222 (median 482 IU/ mL, p = 0.0175). Interestingly, Spearman rank correlation analyses indicated strong relationships between neutralizing antibodies and amounts of spike binding IgM (r = 0.6411, p < 0.001), IgG (0.9328, p < 0.001), and IgA (0.6952, p < 0.001), respectively. Collectively, disparate vaccine strategies for spike protein delivery impacted differently on the humoral immune response and shaped distinctive antibody isotype layouts as well as virus neutralization capacities after single doses of AZD1222 and BNT162b2.",

While both vaccines elicited strong cellular and humoral responses, the individual impacts on the peripheral immune compartment were strikingly different. In detail, the adenoviral vector AZD1222 led to a transient yet profound leukopenia on day 2, involving significant reductions of B and T lymphocytes as well as granulocytes. As decreased leukocyte counts have previously been reported for both, regular adenoviral infections [21] and adenovirus-mediated gene therapeutic approaches [22, 23] , we consider it likely that the leukopenia observed here can be attributed to the viral vector rather than the spike protein [24] . For example, Park and colleagues observed in an outbreak of adenoviral pneumonia among 191 otherwise healthy adults a high percentage of patients that exhibited febrile leukopenia [21] . Furthermore, Varnavski et al. observed a transient decrease of leukocyte counts in two separate studies in which a human adenoviral vector was applied in rhesus macaques and mice, respectively [22, 25] .",

In detail, Kwissa and colleagues have shown that CD14 + CD16 + monocytes were increased in both humans and non-human primates shortly after infection with the dengue virus and that these cells were able to stimulate the differentiation of plasmablasts [28] . Both the enrichment of CD4 + TEMRA and terminally differentiated cytotoxic CD8 + T cells have been associated with human cytomegalovirus Fig. 6 AZD1222 vaccination supported the induction of type 1 helper T cells. PBMCs were isolated on day 20 after vaccination and stimulated with (stim.) or without (unstim.) spike protein encoding mRNA (BNT162b2) for 24 h and analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of inducible activation markers and intracellularly trapped cytokines among CD4 + cells. Sample sizes were n = 9 for AZD1222 and n = 15 for BNT162b2, respectively. Paired samples are illustrated by color coding. In vitro re-stimulation significantly increased CD25 + CD137 + cells in both vaccination groups (A) and TNF\u03b1-producing cells in the AZD1222 vaccinated group, only B.

Indeed, the BNT162b2 encoded mRNA bears an m1\u03a8 modification which attenuates innate immune sensing [34] . We therefore assume that the relatively small enrichment of peripheral plasmablasts after BNT162b2 vaccination, which can also be observed during COVID-19 [35] , resulted from an adaptive response towards the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein whereas the larger enrichment observed with AZD1222 likely reflects a combined response towards the spike protein and the adenoviral vector. In order to verify this hypothesis, future studies should examine the proportions of peripheral plasmablasts and memory B cells that express a B cell receptor specific for either the spike protein or adenoviral antigens, respectively. In fact, a study by Ciabattini and colleagues demonstrated for subjects that were vaccinated with BNT162b2 spike-specific memory B cells that persisted in the circulation for at least 6 months after the second dose [36] .",

A SARS-CoV-2 spike binding antibodies were detected by ELISA and absorbance readouts were normalized to calibrator values to obtain arbitrary units. Gray lines depict the positive response threshold within a range of 0.8 to 1.1 arbitrary units. Sample sizes were n = 18 for AZD1222 and n = 18 for BNT162b2, respectively. p-values resulting from one-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons tests were < 0.0001 for all three isotype analyses. B Neutralizing antibodies were determined by the surrogate virus competitive ELISA.

We also demonstrated that receptor binding domain neutralization strongly correlated with spike binding IgM, IgG, and IgA which is in line with previous data [5, [37] [38] [39] . Even though we cannot yet predict whether this trend will be continued beyond the first 3 weeks after vaccination, a pronounced IgA response combined with a higher virus neutralization capacity following BNT162b2 vaccination may explain its superior effectiveness in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 after both infection with wild type SARS-CoV-2 and its variants [15, 17, 19, 40] . Indeed, Chan et al. demonstrated that, following vaccination with BNT162b2, IgA is detectable in nasal swabs and that plasma IgA levels correlate with their capacity for SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding inhibition which was also demonstrated for patients who recovered from COVID-19 [35, 41] . Optimizing existing vaccines might therefore also aim at alternative antigen delivery, e.g., towards mucosal sites, in order to support not only IgA production but also tissue-resident effector cells which will help contain viral loads at the nasopharyngeal entry sites [42, 43] .",

When analyzing the spike proteinspecific T cell responses, we observed that both vaccines elicited functional immune responses. Both vaccination regimes expanded effector cells to a comparable degree as documented by significant increases in activated CD25 and CD137 co-expressing CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes as well as FasL expressing CD8 + cells upon re-challenge. However, when looking at intracellular cytokine production, AZD1222 induced a prominent type 1 helper T cell (Th1) response as illustrated by significant increases in IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1, respectively. Because adenoviral vectors have previously been shown to facilitate strong cellular immunity towards the delivered antigen and drive the expansion of Th1 cells [6] , we believe that this Th1 reaction towards the adenoviral vector exerted some bystander effect on the response against the spike protein. However, an inordinate Th1 response may foster a cytokine layout that is hardly supportive of class-switch recombination towards IgA [44] . On the other hand, we assessed neither IL-5 nor transforming growth factor (TGF)\u03b2 and are therefore are not yet able to verify whether BNT162b2 indeed induced more IgA promoting cytokines.",

Even though these results seemingly contradict the intracellular cytokine readout of stimulated vs unstimulated day 20 T cells, they show that both vaccines induced Th1 responses. In addition, we found a reduction of IL-2 and IL-10 co-producing CD4 + and CD8 + T cells upon in vitro re-stimulation which however only reached significance in the case of AZD1222 vaccination. IL-10 is a hallmark of regulatory T cells and exerts antiinflammatory effects via suppressing not only effector T cells, but also antigen presentation and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by APCs [45] [46] [47] . We like to speculate that this significant reduction of IL-10 expression is not restricted to in vitro re-challenge but may also occur after booster immunization and perpetuate a Th1 response that impedes an IgA promoting cytokine milieu.",

Nonetheless, our results depict for both vaccines significantly disparate effects on the peripheral immune layout and on the regulation of T cell effector molecules and we assume that these differences were generated by the different strategies for spike antigen delivery. Another limitation is the lack of virus neutralization data using SARS-CoV-2. However, recent data demonstrated that readouts from surrogate virus neutralization robustly correlate with conventional virus neutralization and are therefore a suitable measure for humoral protection from infection [48] .

We propose that the induction of higher quantities of IgA might be associated with superior protection against breakthrough infections after booster injections.

Individuals with a study-independent appointment at a vaccination center were eligible to participate. No other specific inclusion criteria were set. Apart from their age and sex, no other personal data (i.e., underlying medical conditions) were documented. Blood samples were obtained by consecutive venipuncture immediately before vaccination (day 0) and on days 2, 6, 13, and 20 thereafter. Participants that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding IgG were excluded from further analyses. PBMCs were isolated from anti-coagulated blood by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque TM PLUS to the manufacturer's instructions (Cytiva). PBMCs were subsequently suspended in fetal calf serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) and were frozen at \u221270\u00b0C until further use.
