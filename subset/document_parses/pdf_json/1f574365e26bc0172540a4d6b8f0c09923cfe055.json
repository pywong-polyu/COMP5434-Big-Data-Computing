However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, new challenges arose, and many existing ones intensified (Blume et al., 2021) . Due to school closures in spring 2020 related to COVID-19 restrictions in Germany, schools no longer offered a learning environment characterized by students' interactive and analog learning with peers (Schiepe-Tiska et al., 2016a; Eickelmann et al., 2019) under the guidance and support of the teacher (Hattie, 2010) . Instead, home learning became the main form of scholastic learning. In Germany, this meant teachers provided exercises, and parents were required to offer learning support, while physical contact with classmates was restricted (Wildemann and Hosenfeld, 2020; W\u00f6\u00dfmann et al., 2020) . Therefore, digital devices gain importance to participate in scholastic learning.",

            "text": "A well-studied finding is that students' states and traits and their school, family, and peer context influence learning outcomes (Wang et al., 1993; Doll and Prenzel, 2004; Helmke, 2007) . Like in-class learning, there are more or less supporting variables for children and adolescents' in-home learning in the COVID-19 pandemic (M\u00fcller and Ehmke, 2016) . Compared to adolescents, children tend to ask more for support from their parents to cope with a new situation. In line with this finding, parents of children compared to adolescents reported a higher amount of time needed to support students' home learning in Germany in times of COVID-19 (Wildemann and Hosenfeld, 2020) . Further results on learning during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that students who have good grades tend to spend more time learning at home than others. Furthermore, students from higher socio-economic backgrounds report higher perceived learning success, higher learning motivation, more autonomy, and more parental support in home learning. Nevertheless, current studies about home learning (Fickermann and Edelstein, 2020; Huber and Helm, 2020; Thorell et al., 2020) miss out on students' peer context even though peers play an important role in class learning. Classmates can support each other by motivating or explaining on eye level (Wecker and Fischer, 2014) . Therefore, the present study examines students' self-evaluation and process of coping successfully with home learning and its relation to students' support from school, family, and peers. The study applies a mixed-methods design that extends previous research by combining quantitative data about the self-perceived coping success with qualitative data about the process of coping to provide a more complete and nuanced picture than would have been possible with either approach alone. In addition to its value for current research, our paper adds to the knowledge of models of home learning in times of school closures. Finally, considering policymakers, administrators, and school personnel, our paper highlights critical factors that promote or hinder successful home learning.",

Studies indicate the importance of coping strategies to facilitate positive, adaptive outcomes (Sprang and Silman, 2013) . Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, children and adolescents experienced a dramatic shift in how school learning works. To achieve academically in times of COVID-19 lockdown, students must learn to cope with the demands of this new learning situation. Theory and research on coping and learning, therefore, provide a framework to empirically examine students' coping with learning at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The way students cope with new situations depend on personal predispositions and their context (La Fuente et al., 2017) .

Similar to homework, children and adolescents in home learning are confronted with school-related tasks in the home environment. Therefore, homework models (e.g., Trautwein et al., 2006; Moroni et al., 2015) provide a basis for considering the relationships among achievement, homework behavior, homework motivation, student characteristics, parent role, and learning situation. They hypothesize that student characteristics, parent role, and learning situation are central factors in student motivation and behavior, which in turn affect student achievement. The models focus on three main protagonists: students, teachers, and parents. In our theoretical model, we included student peer group as an additional source of help for students in times of home learning.",

While self-efficacy is one's subjective belief in the ability to complete specific tasks in school and overcome obstacles and difficulties (Schwarzer and Jerusalem, 1999) , school joy is more connected to the affective part of Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 733428 the motivation. Self-efficacy is nurtured by comparing with others and feedback from people in their social background (Bandura, 1977) . While self-efficacy and enjoyment are strongly related to students' academic achievement, believing in one's abilities and enjoying learning might also help students cope with challenging learning situations. Previous studies showed that children and adolescents who have and believe in having the necessary abilities show more effort and perseverance in learning even when they face obstacles (Bandura, 1993; Parker et al., 2014) . Furthermore, self-efficacious people are more likely to cope with new situations and challenges (Bandura, 1977; Wigfield et al., 2015) . Children compared to early adolescents show more self-efficacy, and girls compared to boys tend to underestimate their abilities (Schiepe-Tiska et al., 2016b; Skinner and Saxton, 2019) . Moreover, children and girls show a higher tendency to seek the help of others to cope with challenging situations (Skinner and Saxton, 2019) . Besides the well-known gender differences between boys' and girls' self-efficacy, Blume et al. (2021) showed that primary students' gender also correlates with their task enjoyment in times of Studies showed variances in students' academic achievement and motivation during home learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A first review showed that between one-fifth and one-half of the young respondents expect negative consequences on their learning success (Helm et al., 2021) , while a third of them enjoyed learning at home (Helm et al., 2021) . Students who have difficulties organizing and motivating themselves show more problems in coping with learning at home than in school (Becker et al., 2020; Goldan et al., 2020) . Parents predominantly describe their children and adolescents as motivated and expected consistent achievements, while most teachers disagree with parents' impressions (Wildemann and Hosenfeld, 2020; Helm et al., 2021) .",

Family stress models and family investment models emphasize the importance of parental economic situation for the development and well-being of children and adolescents (Conger and Donnellan, 2007) . This link was often explained by the broader possibilities of sufficient income or certain educational attainment to support children and adolescents (Maaz et al., 2014; Moroni et al., 2015; M\u00fcller and Ehmke, 2016) and the stress that economic pressure can cause in families (Conger and Donnellan, 2007) . School engagement of parents was likely to enhance students' school engagement and achievement even for lower performing students (Im et al., 2016) . During early adolescence, it is more the indirect forms of parent involvement in school (e.g., parent-child communication about the school, discussing educational aspirations) that are associated with achievement than direct forms (e.g., helping with homework; Fan and Chen, 2001; Hill and Tyson, 2009 ). Compared to other countries, the direct and indirect relations between students' socio-economic backgrounds and students' coping with learning are highly linked in Germany (M\u00fcller and Ehmke, 2016) .",

Some parents also described their relationship with their children and adolescents as more strained than in the past (Wildemann and Hosenfeld, 2020) .

For peers' effect on learning, the most common perspective is that peers, like families and school, are sources of motivation, aspiration, and interaction partners (Hanushek et al., 2003) . Compared to teachers or parents, peer groups are relationships where children and adolescents can explore, try new things, encourage, inspire, and support each other on eye level (Brandes and Schneider-Andrich, 2017) . By functioning as informational support or role models, by motivating each other to hang on to a task, or by stabilizing each other emotionally, peers have been a valuable resource for learning (Youniss, 1994; Hanushek et al., 2003; Kindermann and Skinner, 2009; Ditton, 2013; Brandes and Schneider-Andrich, 2017) . Nevertheless, children and adolescents are more strongly influenced by peers with whom they have high-quality interactions (Barry and Wentzel, 2006) . It is therefore important that research also focuses on the quality of interactions and how satisfied children and adolescents are with their relationships with their peers.",

We collected data simultaneously within different sample groups. Study 1 addresses the relationships between individual, family, and institutional contexts with self-perceived coping success (RQ2 and RQ3). For this purpose, we analyzed data from an online survey to validate our theoretical model. Study 2 looks at the individual perspectives of children and their parents on the changes in their (learning) everyday life due to the home learning situation. On the one hand, the study focuses on the personal challenges experienced and how they are overcome (RQ1), but on the other, the study elaborates the importance of parental and peer support for the home learning contexts of the students (RQ3). We addressed these questions through semi-structured interviews with students and their parents. Our interviews focused on students' learning situations and their strategies to adapt to the new teaching and learning situation and cope with the associated challenges. Especially the role of teachers, parents, and peers can be presented in detail. We integrate the quantitative and qualitative data to gain a better understanding of students' self-perceived coping success. The operationalization and basis of investigation can be seen in Figure 2 .",

Both datasets were collected via standardized computerassisted personal interviews. The AID:A 2019 probability sample focuses on 0-to 32-year-old target persons sampled with all household members following a stratified sampling process. For the COVID-19 survey, all target persons were contacted again. Our analysis included all students in general schools (except students with special needs) participating in both waves. This procedure resulted in a total sample size of 407 German children and adolescents from 330 households for study 1, which we analyzed in two subsamples: children aged 9-12 years (n = 141) and adolescents aged 13-18 years (n = 266).

Participating families were recruited via a corresponding supplemental question at the end of the quantitative survey (cp. study 1). We selected a quota sample of 21 families from the group of 2,798 parents who agreed to participate in a supplemental qualitative interview of parents and children as part of study 1. Quota sampling was based on the gender of the children (50% girls), the degree of urbanization of the place of residence (two-thirds urban, one-third rural), siblings (two-thirds with, one-third without siblings), and the age of the children (between 6 and 14 years). In addition, we included families' socio-economic background (perceived coping with income) and state of residence in Germany in the sampling procedure. We included 10 interviews with children between the ages of 10 and 14, including four girls and six boys, in the analyses for this paper. The parent interviews were conducted with the mother of the participating child in nine families, and in one family, the corresponding interview was conducted with the father. Eight of the 10 families have more than one child. About the care situation, the families implemented different models. In four families, one parent is mainly responsible for the care tasks (three mothers, one father); in five families, both parents share the childcare, and in one family, the child is cared for by family friends.

Therefore, a key challenge initially was to coordinate the conditions and processes for successful home learning between children, parents, and school. Thus, it is not surprising that the children frequently bring up that they can learn better at school. They miss their teachers' explanations that increase their understanding of learning materials. In addition, the school setting helps them concentrate and motivates them better. In this context, students feel overwhelmed by many tasks with mostly little support from the school. \"We get the assignments from school by email, and you have a bit of a feeling that you somehow get more assignments than you would normally if you went to school, and you also cannot learn or understand things as well as in normal lessons\" (Maja, 11y).",

While younger children of primary school age (6-10y) needed intensive guidance with explanations and substantial instructions to solve given tasks, pupils in secondary school were sometimes already able to work quite independently.

In Germany, face-toface instruction has been replaced by various formats of home learning, in which parents primarily support their children in coping with school obligations. With this in mind, this paper argues that the home learning situation can be described as analogous to parental monitoring of their children's homework. In the literature review, we identified factors that describe the extent to which children cope with the home learning situation. We illuminate this general thought through the presentation of two studies in a mixed-methods approach that examines how students cope with the home learning situation during school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Study 1 shows, through a quantitative online study, that children with differences in school joy, parental support, and quiet place to study, and adolescents with differences in grade, family climate, availability of technological devices, and a quiet place to study cope differently with home learning. The results of the second study highlight, using qualitative telephone interviews with children and youth, students' challenges in solving and completing their assignments, time management, work discipline, and self-motivation. It also reveals that children and adolescents ask parents and peers for help. Parents experienced answering their children's calls for support as an immense effort. In line with previous findings of home learning in times of the COVID-19 pandemic (Huber and Helm, 2020; W\u00f6\u00dfmann et al., 2020) , children's and adolescents' characteristics and their school, family, and peer context affect how students cope with the new home learning situation. Whereas in study 1, based on the mean values, it seems that children and adolescents are coping quite well with the learning situation at home, Study 2 shows that the changed learning situation is accompanied by a series of adaptations, which are also clearly stressful for students.",

Among the students' characteristics, the pre-pandemic grade was found to be particularly significant for adolescents. It is noteworthy, however, that this effect is absent for children. In addition, our results show that children's enjoyment of school before the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to their ability to cope better in the current learning situation at home. Apparently, children and young people who were already better at learning before the COVID-19 pandemic are finding it easier to do so during the pandemic. This result fits with the findings of the interview study that besides solving tasks and completing them, students need to develop new structures in their time organization and a new form of work discipline, for which, in turn, concentration and motivation are essential prerequisites.",

The new, unfamiliar situation is particularly stressful because the students have to work alone for the school. In this respect, coming to terms with this situation is also about overcoming the isolation of being \"alone at your desk\" and creating social connectedness. One possible explanation why the school context is less important in study 1 than reported in previous studies on homework is that home learning has radically changed in times of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the previous results are not directly transferable. Another Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org explanation could be that we only looked at the first period of home learning with the study: Possible differences between different school contexts, such as differences in the type of school, were not (yet) visible. In this first, early phase of the pandemic in Germany, many parents worked at home or were on reduced hours and thus may have been able to support their children in their learning. However, the differences may also be due to our operationalization of the school context with few variables. Furthermore, the study mainly analyzes the quantity of contact and the working time. The quality, on the other hand, was not part of the quantitative study. However, this could also be decisive for the children and adolescents' perceived coping ability.",

The bivariate correlations show that children in deprivation are less well equipped than other children and deprived children report lower coping success. The regression analysis suggests a mediation effect, as the effect of deprivation is removed when equipment availability is controlled for. Thus, it can be stated that children in deprivation are disadvantaged by not having all the necessary resources at their disposal, which affects their self-perceived coping success with home learning.

Thus, the interview study shows that this means not just explaining the tasks correctly. Parents are challenged in their competencies regarding the current learning material and as \"managers\" of home learning by helping the children organize the working day, divide and structure the school tasks, and keep track of the work tasks that have been done and those that still need to be done. Furthermore, they often have to act as \"motivation coaches\" and support concentration and motivation. An explanation for the discrepancy between the quantitative and qualitative data might be that parents can provide support without their children and adolescents noticing it.

            "text": "Considering the theoretical framework, our studies suggest that homework theories (Trautwein et al., 2006; Dumont, 2012) only partially represent the COVID-19 situation. Student characteristics, school characteristics, and the role of parents are indeed important in the current COVID-19 period. However, the respective characteristics are partly different than in the homework situation. This is hardly surprising, as the home learning situation is different from the homework situation: Students spend more time alone doing exercises without getting much feedback than in the pre-pandemic homework situation. Furthermore, the digital changes of the school situation can influence students' achievement and motivation in home learning. Mainly, younger pupils must first acquire the corresponding skills and competencies. In line with the homework model by Trautwein et al. (2006) or the home learning model of Huber and Helm (2020) , parents play a central role. Nevertheless, compared to checking children's and adolescents' tasks, it might be more challenging to support and accompany children in this often new digital learning space. Especially in study 2, the importance of peers becomes visible; this has rarely been considered in the homework literature so far but does not appear in recent models developed for home learning (Huber and Helm, 2020) . It is important that this aspect is taken up in both theoretical considerations and quantitative studies.",

            "text": "Even though the present study provides added value to the existing literature, the study's limitations should also be noted. First, the conclusions of the present analysis are restricted to the study's sample. Second, it should be noted that the AID:A COVID-19-specific add-on was only able to reach a portion of the respondents in 2019. Third, students from the highest school track are overrepresented among our sample. We took into account students up to the age of 18, and students in Germany's highest school track go to school for a longer period of time than in other German school tracks. Fourth, our study is only cross-sectional, limited to the period of the initial lockdown. As a result, no causalities can be verified. Longitudinal data are also needed to examine the interaction of the different contexts. The first study shows that school and family context differs between the first time of strict school closures in Germany due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the second time of school closures (W\u00f6\u00dfmann et al., 2021) . Therefore, to get a more holistic view of students' learning situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the different periods should be regarded. Furthermore, the construct of self-perceived coping success with home learning was only measured with one single indicator. Additional information about students' learning success in the form of grades or tests would be a valuable source for getting more insights into the long-term effects of students' coping with home learning and their performance. The problem of single indicator measures also applies to some predictors in our models (e.g., peer support). This could also be an explanation for the fact that some correlations do not occur as expected. Finally, it should also be noted that no extensive information was available on the individual contexts, so possible central aspects were not taken into account here, which is why the school context, for example, appears to be of little importance.",

As already mentioned, the disadvantages of certain groups of students have to be made up for in the post-pandemic period. If the pandemic lasts longer, or if other situations arise in which learning at home is necessary, it must be ensured that the family is not ascribed such a central role in the learning situation, in addition to adequate equipment necessary for all students. Not all families can adequately support their children. It was already true before COVID-19 and is becoming even more critical in times of home learning.",
