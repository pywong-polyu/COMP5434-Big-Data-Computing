In Australia, COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown measures were introduced from 21st March 2020 [8] and by 31st March 2020, Stage 3 COVID-19 restrictions were in place, where stay at home orders were mandatory, except for essential workers (medical care and caregiving), and members of the public were only allowed out of the home to shop for basic supplies, to exercise, and for work that could not be done from home [9] . These restrictions lasted until 15th May 2020 when some Australian states began easing restrictions on public gathering and non-essential services [8] .",

Furthermore, associated factors of pandemic separations and restrictions such as the fear of infection or infecting loved ones or others, longer durations of social isolation measures, limited access to basic supplies, the lack of clarity around guidelines and purposes of social distancing measures, and stigmatisation can cause frustration and anxiety in people placed under quarantine [14] .

For instance, a systematic review of 19 studies found that depression and anxiety levels were higher and psychological well-being was poorer among the general population globally compared to periods prior to COVID-19 [18] . Other systematic reviews found the general population in China experienced psychological distress including anxiety, depression, stress and posttraumatic symptoms associated with COVID-19 outbreak [19, 20] . A longitudinal study has also found increases in suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and self-harm over time from 31 March to 19 April 2021 among the general adult population in the United Kingdom [21] . In the United States, the proportion of emergency department visits for mental health conditions and suicide attempts were markedly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than the same period in 2019 [22] .",

Among the factors identified are individuals with chronic sickness and poor self-rating of health status [17] , and pre-existing or previous diagnosis of depression and anxiety [23, 28] and lived experiences of mental illness [15] . Furthermore, the risk of severe COVID-19 infection has been found to be higher among individuals with risky lifestyle behaviours including smoking, low levels of physical activity and obesity [29, 30] . Lifestyle behaviours are strongly associated with the mental health outcomes and contribute to the negative mental health consequence of COVID-19 [31] . For instance, increased alcohol consumption was associated with increased depressive symptoms, poor mental health and mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic [32] .",

Studies pre-COVID 19 have suggested FIFO workers in the resources sector in Australia have higher prevalence of psychological distress [34] , loneliness and social isolation [36, 37] and suicidal risk [38] , and risky levels of alcohol consumption [39] than reported in the general populace. For instance, a study has reported 28% prevalence of high to very high psychological distress among FIFO workers compared to 10.8% in the general population [40] . This suggests that FIFO workers may be at a higher risk of experiencing worse mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. FIFO work involves travelling long distances to isolated areas, rotating consecutive days working and living on-site with periods at home [33] . Compared to other work arrangements and the general population, FIFO workers typically work long hours of standard 12 h shifts that may alternate between day and night shifts [41] , live in provided accommodations at worksites away from their home [33, 41] , and work on rotation systems of for example 14 days on and 7 days leave [33] , suggesting intermittent separations from families and other social support. The FIFO work arrangements are commonly practiced in the mining sector; classified as 'essential workplace-where work cannot be done from the home' [42] , workers were exempted from stay home orders during the COVID-19 pandemics, but traveling workers were subjected to quarantines and/or self-isolations. Furthermore, being a high-risk industry, the advent of the pandemic suggests further quarantine and selfisolation on-sites, limited social activities at campsites and possible extended work periods during COVID-19 lock-downs, which may further propagate the distress, loneliness and isolation experienced by some workers, causing poorer mental health. These may also be coupled with uncertainty/fear of job losses due to the falling prices of commodities on the world market and crippling economic nature of the pandemic, which has been found to be one of the stressors among FIFO workers [34] , although the Australian economic has not been badly impacted by the pandemic.",

Post hoc comparisons were conducted for significant variables using Bonferroni t-tests to examine the differences between age, placement under travel quarantine, self-isolation, impacted by social distancing guidelines, and experience of common COVID-19 related symptoms groups. Further, multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between socio-demographic, lifestyle behaviours, history of medical conditions, COVID-19 exposure measures, and COVID-19 related symptoms in relation to the mental well-being of FIFO workers during the early restriction periods of COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.",

This current finding supports findings of previous studies where younger people were found to experience poor mental health during COVID-19 pandemic in Australia [15] and other countries [16, 21, 26, 27] . Mental health has been indicated to be of increased concern among young people [55] , with environmental experiences such as social inequality [56] among others indicated to play an important role in worsening mental health in this population group. In Australia, a national survey has indicated equity and discrimination as one of the major concerns expressed by young people [55] . Furthermore, young people often report problems with coping with stress [55] whereas older age is associated with better emotional stability and higher positive emotional well-being [57] . As such, younger people may find it more difficult to cope with stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to older people who may have developed adaptive skills due to the experiences of previous crises [16] . Again, younger workers may experience negative emotions due to being away from their young families/children at home and also may have additional childcare responsibilities and/or increased financial strain during the pandemic [15] . In addition, the older FIFO workers may have worked FIFO for longer periods and adjusted to the FIFO lifestyle, had more life experiences and developed the emotional resilience and coping skills for stressful events. The current finding suggests the need for younger FIFO workers to be monitored and provided with the support to cope with stresses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative mental health issues that may arise during this period.",

This is in contrast with the observations made in other studies elsewhere in the general population where individuals with history of chronic illness/pre-existing health conditions typically reported poorer mental health outcomes such as stress, anxiety and depression [17, 60] and lower mental well-being [52] . Having pre-existing health conditions can predispose individuals to severe or deadly COVID-19 infections [60] , and as such, could increase the anxiety around getting infected and perceived survival risk when infected, among individuals with pre-existing conditions. Such individuals, as part of protecting themselves from getting infected, are most likely to suffer reduced social interactions significant to promote mental health [13] due to the social and physical distancing guidelines. Furthermore, precautionary COVID-19 exposure measures including self-isolation, impact of social distancing guidelines and testing for COVID-19, and lifestyle behaviours including alcohol intake, smoking and physical activity were found not to be associated with mental well-being in FIFO workers. Findings inconsistent to our study have been documented in other studies e.g., [15, 32, 62, 63] . FIFO workers work in stressful environments and on job arrangements that involve separation from partners and/or families [64] , and as such, workers who are able to develop the skills to cope/adapt or having built a resilience to the work stresses are able to remain in the workforce [65] . This could suggest that most FIFO workers in our study may have developed the emotional stability and resilience to be able to cope with stresses of COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures.",

In this regard, public health managers and organisations should support interventions that identify and prioritise vulnerable groups to guarantee their access to the needed support. Such interventions could include the monitoring and provision of appropriate and sustained support to cope with stresses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative mental health issues that may arise during COVID-19 pandemic, its restriction measures and the subsequent economic disruptions. The findings of this study are also suggestive of the need for public health and organizations to provide prompt and adequate information about the COVID-19 infection and its accompanying public health measures, such as quarantine or self-isolations. Consistent and adequate information on the COVID-19 infection could minimize the anxiety that may surround experiences of symptoms that could be consistent with COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, such information provided in a prompt manner to persons under quarantine will enable better understanding of the importance of being quarantined and minimize the anxiety of being infected or infecting loved ones [14] . The negative mental health consequences of quarantine measures highlighted in this study also underpin the need for public health mangers and organizations to limit the length of quarantine periods, and provide persons with environments that reduce the sense of isolation and improve communication between persons and their families and social networks during quarantines. This has previously been shown to minimize the associated negative consequences of quarantine and improve mental health in other setting, and is likely extendable to the FIFO community [14] .",

However, some limitations of this study are acknowledged to guide the interpretation of our findings. First, the study employed cross-sectional design and techniques to collect data; as such, any causal interpretation of the findings is limited. The study also relied on participants' selfreported data which could not be verified and could therefore be subjected to under-or overestimation of the levels of the study parameters. The study is also limited by small sample survey and self-selection bias: the study relied on non-probability convenient sampling techniques to recruit participants, thus could have resulted in a non-representative sample of the FIFO workers, where workers who were either positively or negatively impacted by COVID-19 choosing to participate in the study or otherwise. Data on participants' educational level, marital status, and occupation were excluded as participants were not willing to provide data on, leading to several loss of data, as such, these variables could not be adjusted for in the multiple linear regression model though they have been documented to be associated with mental health outcomes during COVID-19 [27] . The measure of physical activity may not provide a more precise estimate of typical moderate/vigorous physical activity levels, as the item used did not specify or collect data on the number of minutes spent per day to engage in physical activity. There were also low reported cases of COVID-19 in Western Australia compared to other Australian states like Victoria and New South Wales and reported in other countries. Furthermore, there was also no reported case of COVID-19 among the study population during the course of the study period.",

However, workers who were younger, placed under travel quarantine and experienced symptoms consistent with the common symptoms of COVID-19 had poor mental well-being. Knowing and admitting the negative emotions and distress experiences among this work groups may help in providing suitable support and interventions to help lessen these negative experiences. This study identified vulnerable groups of FIFO workers that need to be monitored and provided with the needed and sustained support to cope with stresses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative mental health issues that may arise during COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent restriction measures.",
