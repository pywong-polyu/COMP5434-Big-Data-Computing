As such, studying HIV drug resistance allows for real-time evaluation of evolutionary mechanisms. Characterizing the biological process of drug resistance is also critically important for sustained effectiveness of ART. Investigating the link between \"black box\" deep learning methods applied to this problem and evolutionary principles governing drug resistance has been overlooked to date. Here, we utilized publicly available HIV-1 sequence data and drug resistance assay results for 18 ART drugs to evaluate the performance of three architectures (multilayer perceptron, bidirectional recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural network) for drug resistance prediction, jointly with biological analysis. We identified convolutional neural networks as the best performing architecture and displayed a correspondence between the importance of biologically relevant features in the classifier and overall performance. Our results suggest that the high classification performance of deep learning models is indeed dependent on drug resistance mutations (DRMs). These models heavily weighted several features that are not known DRM locations, indicating the utility of model interpretability to address causal relationships in viral genotype-phenotype data.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), affects over 1.1 million people in the U.S. today [1] . While there is still no cure, HIV can be treated effectively with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Consistent treatment with ART can extend the life expectancy of an HIV-positive individual to nearly as long as that of a person without HIV by reducing the viral load to below detectable levels [2] and can reduce transmission rates [3, 4] . However, the fast replication rate and lack of repair mechanisms of HIV leads to a large number of mutations, many of which result in the evolution of HIV to resist antiretroviral drugs [5, 6] . Drug resistance may be conferred at the time of HIV transmission, so even treatment-na\u00efve patients may be resistant to certain ART drugs, which can lead to rapid drug failure [7] . As a result, the analysis of drug resistance is critical to treating HIV, and thus is an important focus of HIV research.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 145, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 439, "end": 442, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 477, "end": 480, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 481, "end": 483, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 672, "end": 675, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 676, "end": 678, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 856, "end": 859, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "HIV drug resistance may be directly evaluated using phenotypic assays such as the PhenoSense assay [8] . Both the patient's isolated HIV strain and a wild type reference strain are exposed to an antiretroviral drug at several concentrations, and the difference in effect between the two indicates the level of drug resistance. Resistance is measured in terms of fold change, which is defined as a ratio between the concentration of the drug necessary to inhibit replication of the patient virus and that of the wild type [9] . These tests are laborious, time-intensive, and costly. Additionally, phenotypic assays are reliant on prior knowledge of correlations between mutations and resistance to specific drugs, which evolve quickly and thus cannot be totally accounted for [10] . An alternative, the \"virtual\" or genotypic test, predicts the outcome of a phenotypic test based on the genotype using statistical methods. Several web tools exist for HIV drug resistance prediction based on known genotype profiles, including HIVdb [11] and WebPSSM [12] , utilizing rules-based classification and position-specific scoring matrices, respectively, to predict drug resistance.

The resulting ambiguity in the classification model proves to be a major limitation to the utility of deep learning in translational and clinical applications [22] .
