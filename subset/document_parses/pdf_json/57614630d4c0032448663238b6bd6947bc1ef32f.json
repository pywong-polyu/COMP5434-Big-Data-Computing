When our body is put in action, such form of awareness becomes deeply-linked, though not fully corresponding, even to processing of postural and balance information, muscular and joint stretch, and visceral sensations, up to higher-level representational contents referred to intentions, affordances, and goal-directed action plans. The peculiar and specific form of awareness for the body in action is, then, enriched by further pieces of information concerning afferent sensorimotor and visual-spatial data coming from the moving body and the consequent adaptation of the moving body representations. Such level of self-representation can be defined as embodied motor awareness and grounds on the ability to self-attribute an agentive stance-i.e., sensing ourselves as the cause of our actions and their consequences [2, 3] . Embodied motor awareness can become a strategic target for empowerment protocols designed to favor the development of self-regulation skills during the interaction between an agent and his/her environment and to strengthen the ability to create integrated representations of the acting self and body, thus promoting self-enhancement and psychophysical well-being [4] .",

            "text": "Among them, the Feldenkrais Method (FM) is one of the most established and diffused one, even beyond the field of physiotherapy and motor rehabilitation. It has been originally defined as a somatic education method based on movement and aimed at extending and optimizing the way the body is used to act by working on bodily awareness [6] . The rationale of the method relies on the assumption that increasing awareness of the moving body enables the improvement of movement efficiency during daily activity and decreases dysfunctionality determined by the habitual re-enaction of suboptimal action patterns. To pursue such a goal, the method uses guided exploration practices focused on different sets of movements (both familiar and unfamiliar) in order to train attention, perceptual discrimination, and proficiency in detecting sensorimotor information while moving [7] . The general improvement of the organization of the movement is achieved by exploring and enacting the functional relationship between the kinetic components to be integrated into the action [8] . Besides that, it has been suggested that the implicit learning process subserving such practice also facilitates learning of novel strategies to improve the organization and coordination of body movement, thus developing a richer and more effective spatial and kinesthetic representation of the relationships between body segments [9] . Therefore, among the primary results of regular practice of FM, there is often reported an improvement of posture, balance, and flexibility, as well as the release from muscle tension, the adoption of effective breathing patterns, and a generalized sense of wellbeing and \"centeredness\". Yet, focusing on empirical investigations of the effects of practicing the method, the scenario seems more complex and less defined. Indeed, critical reviews of the available literature exploring the outcomes of protocols using Feldenkrais' techniques have highlighted that regular practice with the method (mainly by following regular group sessions of practice guided by an expert trainer) can reliably improve balance, especially in older adults, and likely leads to the reduced perceived effort while performing complex actions, improved range of motion and dexterity, decreased pain (even in chronic conditions), increased comfort while moving, and improved perception of the body image understood-according to Gallagher [10] -as the synthesis of perceptual, conceptual and emotional representation of the body [11] [12] [13] . Nonetheless, the review report also systematically underlines the high risk of bias presented by the available primary studies, as well as, in many cases, poorly reported methods. Such factors undermine the strength of reported results and of their interpretation.",

            "text": "Investigations of neurofunctional correlates of FM practice or of its outcomes via neuroimaging methods are, indeed, limited, to our best knowledge, to one work by Verrel and colleagues [8] , who reported the first exploratory results regarding increased resting-state activity in higher-order motor areas following a brief FM-based practice involving the feet. While those findings suggest the involvement of action-related neural mechanisms in the learning process elicited by at least some forms of FM practice, no complementary evidence for the effect of FM on the activity and responsivity of the sensorimotor network (which is expected to be the primary target of the training) during actual motor tasks are available. Given the peculiar interest of the method on the development of movement dynamics, on motor control, and on awareness of kinematic chains, electroencephalography might be the method of election in the quest for novel findings on neurofunctional mechanisms supporting FM practice and the related somatic-perceptual learning process. The remarkable cognitive and temporal resolution and the low invasivity of such techniques have already favored its application in exercise and movement sciences [17] [18] [19] , and might represent valuable advantages even in research on mechanisms of action underlying movement-based embodied awareness practices. In particular, task-related synchronization and desynchronization of the EEG mu band proved to be an informative marker of activation and responsiveness of the sensorimotor system during movement-related tasks such as action preparation, execution, observation, and imagination [20] [21] [22] . Monitoring and quantifying the modulations of the mu band during movement-related tasks might then help qualify the neuroplastic changes in sensorimotor activity following a training period of movement-related practices.",

In addition, we will investigate potential training-induced modulations in the complexity of practicers' body structural map-understood as the conscious visual-spatial representation of one's own body, i.e., according to the triadic taxonomy of body representation [26] , the structural description of the relationships between body parts based on both vision and somatic perceptual information-via a standardized human figure drawing test. Indeed, while the effect of FM-based interventions on effective representations that contribute to the definition of the body image has been previously explored by looking at self-reported acceptance, perception, or contentment of specific problematic body parts [27, 28] , the actual level of detail of the structural map of practicers' body seems not to have ever been directly tested.",

Artifactfree data have then been used to compute condition-specific power-density (PD) spectra by fast Fourier transform (Hamming window, resolution: 0.5 Hz). Average power-density for the mu EEG band have finally been extracted, log-transformed and used to compute neurometric measures relative to the premotor (Fz), motor (Cz), and posterior (Pz) regions of the sensorimotor network.

By this calculation, any value lower than 1 would mirror the desynchronization of the mu band (i.e., greater cortical activation) during the task with respect to reference resting-state, while any value higher than 1 would mirror greater synchronization of the mu band (i.e., lower cortical activation) during the task with respect to reference resting-state.",

While clinical reports and narrated examples from clinical practice often point out an increase in the quality and complexity of perceptual and affective representations of the body following regular FM practice, available empirical investigations only provide faint evidence in favor of such an expected outcome. Indeed, to our best knowledge, a modulation of perceived body-image is cited in just two studies on the method, it is mirrored by an unspecific improvement of the self-reported perception of body dynamics in acute patients after myocardial infarction [27] or by increased contentment with regard to problematic body zones and increased familiarity with their body in patients with eating disorders [28] . While such evidence hints at valuable implications for practice, it should be acknowledged that they only scrape the surface of the underlying construct and that the impact of FM practices on the development or improvement of body image and, in particular, of visual-spatial representations of the body should be object of further testing. The here-reported lack of systematic effects of the protocol on the complexity and integrity of the body structural map (as measured via an adapted and quantifiable version of the human figure drawing test) could be explained by the remarkable variability of participants' performances at the test. Such variability might, indeed, have prevented inferential tests from pointing out statistically significant differences following the training period. Yet, qualitatively, it is worth reporting that the observed range of improvement in the experimental group with respect to the control group is higher and that about 60% of EXP participants showed a more complex representation of the body map after the protocol, findings that might be worth further investigation.",

Indeed, while it allows for quantifying the complexity of the examinees' body structural map and while its relatively restricted task instructions allow to reliably elicit the examinee's inner visual-spatial representation of the body, such tests cannot be considered an exhaustive measure of representational levels constituting body image. As an example, the standardized version of the HFD that has been used in this study does not provide information on the conceptual or semantic connotations of the body and its parts (i.e., body semantics) nor on perceived levels of movement efficiency or functionality of the body and its parts. Complementing the HFD with other tools able to capture such features of the body representation might help to better investigate the effects of FM practice on body image and body schema.",

Indeed, frontal structures play a crucial role in planning, programming, and encoding of motor acts [43] [44] [45] , and superior frontal structures-i.e., dorsal premotor cortices-together with the posterior parietal cortex proved to code and process action-related information, well beyond the canonically-defined components of the mirror system [41] .

The integrated activation of the posterior parietal cortex, premotor cortex, and cerebellum allows movement planning and prediction of results [50] . Furthermore, parietal cortices play a crucial role in the integration of motor and perceptual information for the prediction of the sensory consequences of a movement, in the formation of multisensory representations of the body, and in the attribution of actions to oneself [51] . Consistently, lesions of parietal cortices-as well as disconnection of or direct damage to other nodes of the complex system encompassing the premotor loop, the limbic system, and the ventral attentional network [52] -can cause disorders in body and motor awareness, such as a distorted perception of the body or of its components, alteration of the body schema, anosognosia for hemiplegia, and disorders of agency attribution [53] . In addition, parietal areas, together with premotor ones, are involved in the perception and conscious representation of illusory movements following muscle-tendon vibration [54] [55] [56] . Taken together, such evidence outlines the specialization of parietal structures in creating a bridge between perceptual and motor information by integrating them to allow for the implementation of goal-directed actions and in shaping adaptive body representations [54, 57] . The fact that mu rhythm showed a systematic modulation during each action-related task in participants who completed the FM protocol suggests that one of the first latent mechanisms to be affected by the practice might have to do with the integration of sensorimotor information flow to create situated representations of the body in action, which represent a common prerequisite to perceive and code observed actions and to plan and implement actual or imagined actions. The fact that mu desynchronization occurred over central and parietal locations during both action execution and imagination depose in favor of the potential of FM practice to modify processes subserving aware action programming.",

The desynchronization of the mu EEG band was used as a marker of cortical activation to explore the modulation of activation and responsivity of sensorimotor structures induced by regular practice with group ATM sessions. Such electrophysiological marker proved to be able to highlight consistent outcomes of practice, as well as to provide valuable information on potential mechanisms underlying the somatic-motor learning process thought to be at the core of the practice.",

While such consistency could be traced back to the complementarity of neurophysiological processes underlying those action-related functions and to the well-known overlap of the neurofunctional substrates subserving them, it also hints at the pervasivity of the effects of FM practice. Furthermore, we believe that it points out the synergic effect of training awareness of own body in action, consistent with models that suggest that the consciousness of our movements is not an abstract mental process, separate from acting, but an intrinsic element the action implementation mechanisms supported by the extended frontoparietal sensorimotor network [58] .",

The strength of observed findings and their interpretation would therefore benefit from replication with additional samples, and subsequently from further testing with peculiar population groups connoted by suboptimal and/or optimized sensorimotor efficiencies, such as people with motor disturbances or athletes and performance artists, whose profession has likely led them to develop peculiarly optimized body representation and motor schemas. In addition, we acknowledge that the experimental design connoting the present study (i.e., randomized waitlist controlled design)-even though allowing to test the specific effects of FM practice on the complexity of body maps and on responsivity of sensorimotor structures during motor-related tasks, and allowing to preserve ethical principles of equal access to potential opportunities for empowerment and well-being-presents intrinsic limitations when it comes to comparative efficacy with respect to others treatments. Building on preliminary systematic studies on the effects of FM practice and on the mechanisms that foster those effects, future investigations should focus even on exploring the comparative advantages and shortcomings of such embodied awareness practice with respect to other alternative empowerment protocols. Furthermore, future research might include even field measurements of motor performance changes in order to better sketch the extent and practical implication of an empowerment protocol based on embodied awareness practices.
