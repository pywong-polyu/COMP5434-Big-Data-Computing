The encoded video bitstream is typically very bursty with a Variable Bit Rate (VBR), then commonly leading to a self-similar behavior of aggregated traffic. The series of encoded frame sizes usually present long-term dependency [4, 6] , where a router's queue can be severely affected by this behavior. Access networks have capacity-limited when compared with the over-provisioned Internet backbone [7] [8] [9] , and most of the observed congestion occurs in these access networks [10, 11] . According to Adams [12] , a congestion occurs when the arrival packet rate at incoming link interface exceeds the departure rate at output interface. Congestion can cause packet losses in the network due to insufficient queue capacity, and then these drops could affect quality parameters of transmission causing high latency and resources' waste [13] .",

This phenomenon is known bufferbloat. Large buffers cause high queue delay, especially during congestion events. On the other hand, smaller buffers reduce queue delay, but at the cost of increasing packet loss and decreasing link utilization [12] .

End-to-end latency and packet discard in the router's queue impairs the quality of live videos. In DASH VoD system, the client buffer stores many segments as possible, mitigating effects of delay, jitter, and packet retransmission. However, large buffers should be avoided in live streaming, once a few seconds of buffer delay are not admitted. Packets of live videos have a deadline either on the server or on the client, becoming useless after a few seconds. Thus, the bufferbloat phenomenon results in video quality reduction for live DASH and AQM can be used to prevent congestion of router's queues and improve the quality of video as perceived by the user [18] .",

Most AQMs randomly discard packets during congestion periods, regardless of the nature of the traffic pattern. The self-similar behavior of video traffic and the problem of bufferbloat may increase the average packet delay. This, in turn, impairs the quality of live streams, as the packets have strict delay limits. Live video streaming traffic has predictable features, which can be used to implement a new class of AQM algorithms. Considering DASH live streaming, AQM could assist DASH to prevent quality degradation caused by network congestion, performing early discards and anticipating congestion, leading to a smoother adaptation procedure, resulting in better average video quality, and reducing the number of DASH quality switches.",

The proposed AQM uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [20] with Neural Networks to predict the behavior of the queue fed by DASH live video. Based on the forecast of queue delay, the new proposed method performs a random early discard to prevent future congestion, forcing traffic sources to reduce their transmission rate. This process induces the DASH clients to decrease the quality of segments before congestion arises. We show that proposed method improves average user-perceived video quality. LSTM has been shown to model temporal series with Long Range Dependence (LRD) more accurately than conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and traditional forecasting models [21] . LSTM-NN is computationally efficient, with a worst-case time complexity given by O(n), where n is the number of weights [20] , allowing its implementation in routers. Performance evaluation was done using real DASH servers and clients transmitting through a simulated network implemented with Network Simulator version 3 (NS-3) [22] . The quality of the received video was estimated with the structural similarity index (SSIM) and with the number and duration of interruptions. We present performance comparisons between proposed method and state-of-the-art AQM algorithms: RED, adaptive RED (ARED), Controlled Delay (CoDel), and Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced (PIE). To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies evaluating the impact of AQMs in end user's perceived video quality, as well as an AQM designed for improved quality of live DASH. Results show that the average SSIM varies greatly, depending on the AQM method implemented in the routers and as the network congestion increases. Considering live DASH, the proposed method outperforms all the competing AQMs.",

Large buffers have been inserted all over the Internet without sufficient thought or testing [31] . This phenomenon causes high latency and jitter, with negative effects on the applications. Controlled Delay Management (CoDel) [32] is an AQM designed to provide a solution for the bufferbloat problem. Its operation is based on the queuing delay control by creating a timestamp of packet arrival time. CoDel uses two keys variables: target and interval. In conformance with RFC 8289 [33] , ideal values of target are 5% to 10% of the connection Round Trip Time (RTT). Because most unbloated RTTs in open terrestrial-based Internet have a ceiling of 100 milliseconds [34] , default values of interval and target are set as 100 and 5 milliseconds, respectively. At each interval, CoDel computes the delay of all packets dequeued for forwarding. If the minimum queue delay is lower than the target, or the buffer contains fewer than MTU worth of bytes, packets are not dropped. If minimum delay is greater than the target, CoDel enters in drop mode, and a single packet is discarded. Then, the next interval is set in accordance with the inverse square root of the number of successive intervals in which CoDel is in drop mode. Thus, default sequence of the interval in drop mode is given by 100, 100/ \u221a 2, 100/ \u221a 3, . . .. Once the minimum delay of all packets in interval goes below the target, CoDel exits the drop mode, no packets are discarded, and interval returns to its default value. According to the authors, CoDel became attractive to queue management because itn segments: is easy and efficient to implement, in addition to being parameterless [32] .",

PIE may randomly drop a packet in the presence of congestion; however, congestion detection is based on the queuing latency like CoDel instead of the queue length like conventional AQM schemes. PIE discards packets randomly according to a probability. The drop probability is computed using the current estimation of the queuing delay and the delay trend, which means the delay increases or decreases. PIE algorithm updates the drop probability periodically using Little's law (queue delay is given by the ratio between queue size and arrival rate) and the delay threshold. In addition, the scheme uses a maximum allowed value for packet bursts to be allocated in the buffer. Auto tuning of parameters is used not only to maintain stability but also to adapt to sudden changes. Once the drop probability is updated periodically, short packet bursts are allowed during this time without any extra discard. Pan et al. [35] argue that PIE design is stable for an arbitrary number of flows with heterogeneous RTTs and achieves low latency and high link utilization under various congestion situations.",

Called CHOKeH, the algorithm reduces the drop rate of responsive flows without the need to maintain any per-flow state. The basic idea of CHOKeH is similar to RED, using the average queue size to measure the network congestion and two thresholds, min th and max th . For each packet arrival, if the average queue size is between min th and max th , CHOKeH splits the current queue size in two regions of equal length, the rear and front regions. CHOKeH randomly choose the dropcandidates of each region with differently probabilities. This procedure ensures that high bandwidth unresponsive flows with many recent arrivals are penalized. The results show that the CHOKeH achieves better throughput and a stable behavior of average queue size than competing AQMs.",

Besides resolving the gradient problem, LSTMs are capable to retain information longer than regular RNNs [41, 43] . Furthermore, LSTM predicts time series with long-range dependence more accurately than the RNN [41, 44] . According Dashtipour et al. LSTM is a successful augmented RNN model which is used to learn sequential information with dependencies that LSTM can store and use to compute information for a long time period [45] . LSTM memory block comprises four main units: the memory cell, the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate. The memory cell (C t ) is recurrently connected and is in charge to maintain or forget information at every new interaction. The forget gate ( f t ) determines which information should be removed from previous state of memory cell (C t\u22121 ). For that, f t uses the current input of the network (x t ) and the output at previous time step (y t\u22121 ). The most used sigmoid function (\u03c3) scales all values of f t into a range from 0 (completely forget) to 1 (completely remember):",

This is possible if the router in access network uses a traffic classifier, what is feasible.

            "text": "The performance evaluation was done by integrating \"real\" DASH server and client into a NS-3 simulation. DASH server and client were implemented using virtualization. The network topology was implemented as recommended by International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation G.1050 [47] . ITU-T G.1050 describes a model for evaluating multimedia transmission performance over IP networks. Figure 2 presents the implemented scenario for simulations. The Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) simulates the bottleneck in the access network, connecting the client and edge routers by a 6 Mbps link. This enabled us to generate background traffic to evaluate the AQM algorithms at several congestion levels. The remaining links were set to 1 Gbps and 100 Mbps as proposed by ITU recommendation. DASH server and client were implemented using the GPAC Project on Advanced Content [48] . They were installed in virtual machines and were attached to the simulated scenarios through a tap bridge. The AQM was installed at the edge router, also as illustrated by Figure 2 . Background traffic sources were implemented using the On-Off application class of NS-3. The duration of On and Off states is modeled by random variables. During the Off period, no traffic is generated and in the On state, a Constant Bit Rate (CBR) is produced. Modeling On and Off states, respectively, with the Pareto and Exponential probability distributions, enables the simulation of video traffic with self-similar characteristics [49, 50] . The On and Off states were configured using the duration and time interval between video frames, respectively. The On-Off Pareto model has self-similar characteristics [49, 50] , with Hurst parameter given by H = 3\u2212\u03b1 2 [51] . The H parameter is typically adjusted between 0.5 and 1.0 for long-range dependent time series, and according to Fitzek and Reisslein [52] the VBR encoding have Hurst parameters above 0.7 for all aggregation levels, with a high degree of long-range dependence. Furthermore, \u03b1 and x m parameters were set to produce self-similar background traffic with Hurst parameter of 0.85. Several simulations were performed by varying (i) the AQM method used and (ii) number of background traffic sources. The former were varied from 0 to 14 flows, using maximum transfer unit of 1500 bytes and generating a traffic rate of 500 kbps-as they are TCP sources the traffic will adapt according to network conditions. For each video and background traffic intensity, in addition to the proposed method and Droptail, the following AQMs were tested: RED, ARED, CoDel, and PIE. The RED's max th threshold was set to 500 packets and min th of 250 packets. This induces RED to allow a maximum of 1 s of queue delay.",

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the videos used, such as video total length, number of frames, genre, detail, motion activity, format of raw video source, and frame rate. The videos were selected from different genres, detail, and motion activity, improving the diversity in performance evaluation. The detail feature provides a summary of the histogram descriptors in the pictures of raw video sequence and the motion activity captures the degree or intensity of scene changes [54] . Motion activity has the following meaning [55] : (1) very low intensity, (2) low intensity, (3) medium intensity, (4) high intensity, and (5) very high intensity. The BBB is the longest video sequence used in the tests, with 1440 frames and 40 s, presenting very low motion intensity and medium detail, those two characteristics lead to a good compression ratio. The SF video uses a fixed camera to capture a bee in the foreground and a flower in the background, with low motion intensity and high detail. RH and PA videos display, respectively, medium and high motion intensity, and medium detail. PA shows people passing by to a very close camera while RH records the vehicle traffic in a rush hour in the city of Munich. RB uses a fixed camera to capture water movements, presenting high motion intensity and detail. We included a Touchdown Pass (TP) video to test the sports genre. TP illustrates fast-moving players on an American football field and consists in 570 frames, 19 s, raw video format of YUV422, and 30 fps.",

An interruption occurs when the video playback is temporally stalled as a consequence of buffer starvation due network congestion [61] . As long as the download rate is greater or equal to the rate at which the video is played, the playback is not interrupted. If the download rate falls below the playback rate, the DASH client automatically switches to a lower representation. However, if the network conditions become noticeably bad even a lower bit rate segment cannot be downloaded in time. Thus, in a DASH live streaming, network congestion can lead to the expiration of a segment. According to Juluri, Tamarapalli, and Medhi [61] , these interruptions events lead to a poor user perceived experience. Apart from the number of interruptions, its duration is also an important metric in live streaming.

The Touchdown pass, Big Buck Bunny, and Sunflower videos were transmitted in a NS-3 point-to-point simulated network with a link rate of 6 Mbps. They were chosen for presenting a diversity from high, medium, and low detail and motion activity. The link delay was increased from 50 to 300 milliseconds with steps of 10 milliseconds. We take the average SSIM of all three videos and mapped it into a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) metric as showed in Table 2 . MOS is a popular subjective metric often used to rate user's Quality of Experience, ranking the video from 5 (excellent) to 1 (bad) [64] . Table 3 presents the SSIM impact when link delay goes increasing and its MOS mapping. With average queue delay above 150 milliseconds, the average SSIM is high and the MOS is good, close to excellent. Thus, we use 150 milliseconds as the low th . Below this threshold, no packet discards are needed. As link delay crosses 150 milliseconds and keeps on increasing, MOS is reduced from 4 to 2, until the link delay reaches 240 milliseconds. Therefore, mid th was set to 240 milliseconds. Between 150 and 240 milliseconds, the proposed method discards packets with probability p 1 . The variable w was set to 0.8, concentrating the most of packets discard between those thresholds. Above 240 milliseconds, MOS goes down to 1, and attains the worst value (bad). Hence, up th was set to 300 milliseconds. Between 240 and 300 milliseconds, the proposed method discards packets with probability p 2 . Variable \u03b4 has been set to 100 milliseconds, which gives the LSTM neural network enough time to make the prediction. Because we use a hybrid scenario, mixing simulated and real traffic, values lower than 100 milliseconds interfered in the live streaming, thus decreasing all AQM performance. This is because of the CPU performance of used machine (an Intel i7 seventh generation). Figure 3 presents the average SSIM as a function of the active background sources. It is possible to see that the proposed method outperforms the competing AQMs, mainly when the bottleneck link is highly congested. ARED presents the second best performance. Droptail displays the worst SSIM, because of the bufferbloat phenomenon, which causes a massive increase in the queue delay. The RED discard policy and the burst pattern of the background traffic sources decrease RED performance. However, it is possible to observe that RED's performance is improved when the network became more congested-this was also induced by the small buffer size of 750 Kbytes used for RED. In this case, DASH clients are no longer able to probe enough link bandwidth and start to request only lower-quality segments. This reduces the quality switches and enables the client to download more video segments.",

            "text": "We also evaluate the average SSIM for all videos to allow a better understanding of video quality degradation. As illustrated in Figure 4 , the proposed method outperforms the competing AQMs. For 12, 13, and 14 active background sources, the proposed method has a gain of 0.02, 0.16, and 0.22, respectively, over the better-ranked AQMs. Tables 4 and 5 show the number (N) and duration (D) of interruptions for BBB and RB videos. Each segment is 1 s long. One can see that the proposed method outperforms the competing AQMs for both metrics. Considering the BBB video, the proposed AQM interrupts the video only once and by 1 s in highest level of congestion. For the same level, ARED and PIE interrupt the video twice for 19 s, whereas CoDel, Droptail, and RED, for more than 20 s. When ten backgrounds sources are active, Droptail and RED interrupt the video for 15 and 12 s, respectively. Droptail stops the video 4 times. This is due to bufferbloat phenomenon. In the case of RED, the cause is queue occupation instability, which makes the customer switch abruptly between the quality of segment. 0  0  1  1  2  9  2  19  CoDel  0  0  2  9  1  28  1  32  Droptail  4  15  1  35  1  38  1  40  RED  2  12  1  20  1  13  1  26  PIE  0  0  1  3  1  19  2 19 As shown in Table 5 , the proposed AQM does not interrupt the RB video. RED is the only AQM that stalls the video when 10 backgrounds source are running, which is worse than Droptail. On the other hand, when 14 backgrounds sources are active, RED does not interrupt the video. As mentioned earlier, this is because of the high level of congestion and the size of queue used for RED, which denies the DASH client to request the highestquality segments. When 12 or more background sources are active, Droptail fails to play the entire video. Figure 5 presents the quality transition among the segments for BBB video with 10 background sources. RED and Droptail allow the DASH client to request the highest quality of segments, even with the network congested. Self-similar traffic has a great variability, which is also reflected in the queue occupation. The DASH client ends up losing the next segments timeout on the server. As a consequence, the video's playback is stalled for both RED and Droptail, negatively impairing the quality perceived by the user. In simulations using background traffic without self-similarity, the impairment in quality is much lower. This behavior was noticed in several simulations. In the opposite way, the proposed method is able foresee the queue behavior and induces the DASH client to reduce the quality of segments in small steps. The combination between delay thresholds and the two linear discard probabilities, based on predicted queue delay, achieves a smoothed transition between segments. Overall, the proposed method presents better average PSNR than competing AQMs. The use of proposed method results in shorter and less frequent interruptions in video playback. With more than 10 traffic sources, Droptail shows the worst performance for both. Indeed, the bufferbloat phenomenon increases packet latency, which causes segment expiration and often freezes video playback.",

However, considering the live video streaming, the use of large buffers is not allowed, because large buffers may result in higher delay because of the buffering time, mainly in situations of network congestion. Choosing video segments with better quality increases network congestion, which paradoxically worsens the user-perceived quality. If the network conditions become noticeably bad even a low-quality segment cannot be downloaded in time. This could lead to an expiration of in-flight segments or in the server. This, in turn, can freeze the video for a couple seconds, impairing in the user-perceived quality.",

Long Short-Term Memory was used to forecast the queue delay, anticipating the congestion-this is possible because video traffic is highly auto-correlated and can be predicted. The performance evaluation was done combining computer simulation and real video streaming. We also evaluate the performance of several AQM strategies available in the literature to live video streaming, which is another contribution of this article. Results indicate that the proposed method achieves a better average PSNR for real-time video streaming than ARED, CoDel, Droptail, PIE, and RED. Also, the proposed AQM algorithm decreases the number and duration of video interruptions, mainly for congested networks.",
