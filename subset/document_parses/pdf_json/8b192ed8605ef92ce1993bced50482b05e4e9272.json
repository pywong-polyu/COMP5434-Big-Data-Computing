The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between immune-inflammatory index and mortality in PSI IV-V patients with COVID-19. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of COVID-19 patients from Feb. to Apr. 2020 in the Zhongfa Xincheng Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Patients who presented high severity of COVID-19related pneumonia were enrolled for further analysis according to the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) tool. Results. A total of 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were identified at initial research. The survival analysis revealed that mortality of the PSI IV-V cohort was significantly higher than the PSI I-III group (p = 0:0003). The overall mortality in PSI IV-V patients was 32.1% (9/28). The fatal cases of the PSI IV-V group had a higher level of procalcitonin (p = 0:022) and neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio (p = 0:033) compared with the survivors. Procalcitonin was the most sensitive predictor of mortality for the severe COVID-19 population with area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78, higher than the neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio (0.75) and total lymphocyte (0.68) and neutrophil (0.67) counts. Conclusion. Procalcitonin and neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio may potentially be effective predictors for mortality in PSI IV-V patients with COVID-19. Increased procalcitonin and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were associated with greater risk of mortality.",

The PSI scoring tool is based on 20 demographic, comorbid, and clinical variables. Higher PSI scores indicate greater risk of adverse outcome, such as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality. The overall mortality rate ranged from 9 to 27% in severe pneumonia patients (defined as PSI class IV-V) [9] . Recently, PSI has been applied in severity assessment for COVID-19 patients. PSI could provide moderate to good predictive value in the mortality rate of COVID-19 [10, 11] . However, many fatal cases are asymptomatic or present mild symptoms after viral infection [4] . Thus, the criteria of real \"severe cases\" classified by the PSI system needs to be reconsidered.",

On the other hand, the total lymphocyte count is decreased in severe cases [19, 20] .

The findings showed that those with higher PSI scores had a greater mortality and shorter survival duration than the mild symptom cohort (p = 0:0003). Specifically, most PSI IV-V patients died within 10 days after admission. The majority of fatal cases occurred within 30 days. (Table 1) .

The general mortality ratio of COVID-19 patients was 2.7% (2 out of 73) for the nonsevere group and 32.1% (9 out of 28) for the severe cohort. Our finding suggests that COVID-19 patients presented greater risk of adverse clinical outcome compared with other typical community-acquired pneumonia [22, 23] .

However, previous data mainly focus on the general infected population with mild to severe symptoms. The prognostic value of these immune-inflammatory parameter in severe COVID-19 patients remains uncertain. In this study, we found that the difference of WBC and neutrophil counts and CRP is not significant in severe cases with COVID-19. Only PCT and NLR are sensitive predictors for mortality. Given that only severe pneumonia cases were included, the optimal cut-off threshold of NLR (8.3) for mortality was much higher than the value (NLR < 3:13) reported previously [14] . Thus, the higher levels of PCT and NLR may be effective predictors of COVID-19 death, especially for the severe pneumonia cases. In addition to COVID-19, accruing evidence has demonstrated that NLR can be a useful biomarker of cerebral infarct [25] , cerebral hemorrhage [26, 27] , major cardiac events [28] , cancers [29] , sepsis, and other infectious pathologies [30] .

We think it necessary to examine the validation of immune-inflammatory parameters in a larger cohort, especially for the severe cases. Second, some important immune-inflammatory parameters, such as interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-) \u03b1, were not evaluated due to the retrospective study design. Finally, we only observed the clinical outcome during hospitalization; the long-term outcome may be useful for the decision of public health strategy in the future.",
