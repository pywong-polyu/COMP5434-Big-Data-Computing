Nursing home residents are often frail, older individuals who cannot live independently due to their health status, functional limitations, cognitive and physical impairments, and other age-related disabilities. 1 COVID-19 has highlighted the vulnerability of nursing home residents, who have disproportionately suffered effects of the pandemic. They are at higher risk of severe disease and mortality from COVID-19 due to their age 2 and comorbidities. 3 In addition, nursing homes' communal living environment increases the risk of the spread of COVID-19, particularly for nursing homes that lack adequate infection prevention and control measures to prevent transmission. 4 As of February 18, 2021, nearly 625,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported among U.S. nursing home residents, representing about 23% of the total COVID-19 cases in the United States. During this period, nursing home residents accounted for 26% of reported COVID-19 related deaths. 5, 6 More than 90% of nursing homes have had at least one confirmed COVID-19 case among residents, and about 77% of nursing homes reported at least one COVID-19 death among residents. In addition, COVID-19 infection and death rates vary considerably across nursing homes.",

Several studies have examined the relationship of COVID-19 infections and/or mortality with nursing home quality [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] and nurse staffing levels. [12] [13] [14] However, the findings of these studies have been mixed partly because they either did not use national data and/or were conducted early in the pandemic, limiting their generalizability across states and across time periods with different COVID-19 infection rates. Furthermore, much of the existing literature has focused on COVID-19 incidence or mortality as the main outcomes of interest. Comparatively, little attention has been given to nursing homes with persistent COVID-19 burden. The lack of consistent understanding of factors related to COVID-19 outbreaks hampers the development of responses to mitigate COVID-19 effects.",

For each rating, more stars indicate higher quality, and each incorporates aspects of risk-adjustment, to account for factors captured by the ratings that are not within the nursing home's control, such as resident casemix. We briefly describe each domain below. 21 The health inspection star rating is based on the scope and severity of regulatory deficiencies identified on the three most recent annual state health inspections as well as inspections arising from complaints and, during the pandemic, focused infection control surveys. The most recent survey findings are weighted more heavily than those from prior surveys. The focused infection control surveys are surveys CMS developed early in the pandemic to allow surveyors to quickly inspect nursing homes explicitly for compliance with federal expectations for preventing the transmission of COVID-19, 22,23 and the results of these surveys were first incorporated into the health inspection ratings in January 2021. To account for variation among states in survey results, health inspection ratings are based on the relative performance of facilities within a state. 21 The staffing rating is based on two, quarterly, case-mix adjusted staffing measures: (1) total nursing hours per resident per day, including registered nurses (RN), licensed practical/vocational nurses, and certified nurse aides 21, 24 ; and (2) RN hours per resident per day. Staffing levels are based on Payroll Based Journal data that nursing homes report on a quarterly basis. 24 The case-mix adjustment for staffing levels is based on resident daily census derived from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) and each nursing home's daily distribution of residents in each of 66 Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV), with the data for grouping derived from resident MDS assessments.",

For this portion of the model, we included factors that we hypothesized to be associated with the initial susceptibility of a nursing home to the introduction of COVID-19. Specifically, we included number of certified beds, cumulative county COVID incidence, urban location, and county ADI. We conducted all analyses at the nursing home level, and the measure of association is the incidence rate ratio.

The findings suggest that nursing homes can adopt practices associated with improved quality that are empirically associated with a lower COVID incidence. For example, nursing homes that ensure better compliance with federal regulations, or facilities that have higher staffing ratios, have a lower COVID incidence. The findings underscore the importance of health inspection surveys and suggest a modest relationship between higher overall ratings and lower rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Second, our measures of nursing home COVID-19 outcomes depend on the reporting by individual nursing homes to the CDC and may represent an undercount, particularly due to variability in the availability of testing. Additionally, our use of cumulative incidence and mortality does not account for the dynamic shifts in the number of nursing home residents over time.

However, we deliberately chose to control primarily for factors outside of nursing home control, such as county-level COVID-19 rates, urban location, and the case-mix adjustments incorporated in the star rating algorithms. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that policymakers can use star ratings, along with information on county infection rates and nursing home size and payor mix, to identify nursing homes more at risk of COVID-19 or potentially other infectious outbreaks. Nursing homes with lower star ratings or residing in counties with higher infection rates may benefit from additional resources, such as technical assistance on infection control practices. We note that the practices that reduce the spread of COVID-19 (e.g., effective hand hygiene, screening for symptoms of infection, appropriate use of personal protective equipment [PPE] ) are also effective at preventing the transmission of other viruses and are requirements for compliance with federal infection control standards; further, assuring compliance with these standards is central to the focused infection control surveys, included in health inspection ratings as of January 2021. Therefore, facilities with lower star ratings may also be more susceptible to outbreaks of other communicable diseases than facilities with higher star ratings.",

First, it clearly demonstrates a relationship between the quality of nursing home (NH) care and the incidence of and mortality from COVID-19. Second, it provides additional data to support, at least in part, the validity of the NH Five-Star quality rating system. Several studies in JAGS and other journals with a much smaller sample of NHs have examined the relationship between NH quality and COVID-19. While they have found variable associations with NH Five-Star quality ratings, two things were clear from these studies. First, the incidence of COVID-19 in NHs is related to the prevalence of the virus in the surrounding community. Second, nursing staffing is critical in preventing the spread of the virus throughout a NH. The current study, using data from almost all of the over 15,000 NHs in the United States documents a consistent and statistically significant association between Five-Star quality ratings and cumulative incidence of and mortality from COVID-19.",

Alternatively, CMS works with a contractor and a technical expert panel to carefully develop and validate the quality measures, at least from a statistical perspective. While it is true that an individual NH's Five-Star rating may not accurately reflect that facility's quality of care, culture, clinical outcomes, and resident/family satisfaction with care, it is extremely challenging to develop valid measures of all these outcomes, and to mitigate the effects of \"gaming the system\" through documentation practices. Changing the way that post-acute and long-term care is provided and funded in United States and further developing valid, personcentered quality measures are among the most important tasks for the field of Geriatrics.
