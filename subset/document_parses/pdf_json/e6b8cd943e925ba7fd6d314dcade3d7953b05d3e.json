Studies have shown that Bruton Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors can reduce inflammation reaction by blocking the Toll-like receptors signaling pathways, which is a good choice for patients with lymphoma [7] . Cytokines can promote tumor progression, indicating cytokine inhibitors, such as anti-IL-6 (Tocilizumab), may bring more benefits to cancer patients. This letter is, to our knowledge, the first to determine the risk of COVID-19 for patients with cancer by a pan-cancer analysis about the expression level of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and want to provide some advices for clinical physicians.",
