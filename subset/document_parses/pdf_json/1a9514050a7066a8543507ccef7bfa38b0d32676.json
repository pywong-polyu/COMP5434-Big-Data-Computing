Recent advances have allowed paired capture of protein abundance and transcriptomic state, but a lack of epigenetic information in these assays has left a missing link to gene regulation. Using the heterogeneous mixture of cells in human peripheral blood as a test case, we developed a novel scATAC-seq workflow that increases signal-to-noise and allows paired measurement of cell surface markers and chromatin accessibility: integrated cellular indexing of chromatin landscape and epitopes, called ICICLE-seq. We extended this approach using a dropletbased multiomics platform to develop a trimodal assay that simultaneously measures transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), epitopes, and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) from thousands of single cells, which we term TEA-seq. Together, these multimodal single-cell assays provide a novel toolkit to identify type-specific gene regulation and expression grounded in phenotypically defined cell types.",

Like most other human tissues, PBMCs are a complex, heterogeneous mixture of cell types derived from common stem cell progenitors (Laurenti and G\u00f6 ttgens, 2018) . Despite the genome being mostly invariant between different PBMC cell types, each immune cell type performs an important and distinct function. Understanding the genomic regulatory landscape that controls lineage specification, cellular maturation, activation state, and functional diversity in response to intra-and extracellular signals is key to understanding the immune system in both health and disease (Satpathy et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Recent improvements in single-cell genomic methods have enabled profiling of the regulatory chromatin landscape of complex cell-type mixtures. In particular, droplet-based single-nucleus or single-cell assays for transposase-accessible chromatin (snATAC-seq, scATAC-seq, dscATAC-seq, mtscATAC-seq) allow profiling of open chromatin at single-cell resolution (Buenrostro et al., 2015; Lareau et al., 2019) . Promising new methods have combined scATAC-seq with simultaneous measurement of nuclear mRNAs (e.g., sci-CAR, Cao et al., 2018; SNARE-seq, Chen et al., 2019; SHARE-seq, Ma et al., 2020) or in combination with cell surface epitopes (ASAP-seq, Mimitou et al., 2020) . However, a unifying approach for all three modalities that can be applied to highly specified functional immune cell types has yet to emerge in the landscape of single-cell methods. We systematically tested whole cell and nuclear purification and preparation methods for PBMCs to overcome limitations that restricted previous assays to measurement of only nuclear components (ATAC and nuclear RNAs) or proteins on the cell surface. We found that intact, permeabilized cells perform extremely well for scATAC-seq, exceeding conventional scATAC-seq on nuclei by some measures (Figure 1b) . This insight enables a new protocol analogous to Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes (CITE-seq; Stoeckius et al., 2017) to measure both surface protein abundance and chromatin accessibility: integrated cellular indexing of chromatin landscape and epitopes (ICICLE-seq, Figures 1a and 3) . Finally, we demonstrate that our optimized permeable cell approach can be combined with a droplet-based multiomics platform to enable the simultaneous measurement of three different molecular compartments of the cell: mRNA (by scRNA-seq), protein (using oligo-tagged antibodies), and DNA (by scATAC-seq), which we term TEA-seq after Transcription, Epitopes, and Accessibility ( Figure 4) . These assays enable a new, more unified view into the molecular underpinnings of gene regulation and expression at the single-cell level.",

This single-nucleus assay utilizes a combination of hypotonic lysis, detergents, and a saponin to isolate nuclei without retaining mitochondrial DNA. After performing snATAC-seq using this method, sequencing, and tabulating data quality metrics (Materials and methods), we identified two major populations of cell barcodes (Figure 1b , left panel): (1) a large number of barcodes, shown in gray, that have a low number of unique fragments and a low fraction of reads in peaks (FRIP). These barcodes contain little useful information but consume 80% of total sequenced reads (Figure 1e , non-cell barcodes) at a sequencing depth of 200 million reads per library (20,000 reads per expected barcode). (2) Barcodes with higher quality as measured by FRIP (red points) that contain enough information to attempt downstream analysis.",

Previous studies of scRNA-seq data have shown that cellular lysis can release ambient RNA that increases the abundance of lowquality barcodes and contaminates droplets, yielding barcodes with both cellular and ambient RNAs that reduces the accuracy of the transcriptional readout (Marquina-Sanchez et al., 2020) . We reasoned that nuclear isolation protocols may cause the release of ambient DNA, causing a similar effect in scATAC-seq datasets. Optimization of nuclear lysis protocols, especially changing to less stringent detergents, provided increased FRIP and decreased non-cell barcodes (Figure 1-figure supplement 1, Figure 1 -figure supplement 2a). Hypotonic lysis conditions used in these protocols may also be a biophysical stressor to the native chromatin state, as previously observed (Lima et al., 2018) . To reduce perturbation of chromatin and retain the cell surface for multimodal assays, we performed cell membrane permeabilization under isotonic conditions to allow access to the nuclear DNA without isolating nuclei through hypotonic lysis. The saponin digitonin was used to cause concentration-dependent selective permeabilization of cholesterol-containing membranes while leaving inner mitochondrial membranes intact, preventing high levels of Tn5 transposition in mitochondrial DNA (Adam et al., 1990; Colbeau et al., 1971) . Digitonin has previously been used for ATAC-seq assays under hypotonic conditions in Fast-ATAC (Corces et al., 2016) and plate-based scATAC-seq (Chen et al., 2018b) ",

            "text": "We assessed the quantitative and qualitative differences between nuclei and permeabilized cell protocols with and without sorting by performing both protocols on a single set of input cells. To fairly compare data quality across methods, we equally downsampled raw data at the level of raw sequenced reads per well for each sample that we compare directly (see Materials and methods for details). We then utilized a uniform set of transcription start site (TSS) regions (TSS \u00b1 2 kb) and a previously published PBMC peak set (Lareau et al., 2019 , Materials and methods) as reference regions for computation of fraction of reads in TSS (FRITSS) and FRIP, respectively. Permeabilized cells yielded many more high-quality cell barcodes than nuclear preps using equal loading of cells or nuclei (15,000 loaded, expected 10,000 captured, Table 1 ). scATAC-seq libraries prepared from nuclei contained many more reads originating from nucleosomal DNA fragments (Figure 1b , lower panels), and non-cell barcodes from nuclei (gray lines) contained more of these fragments than cell barcodes. Thus, an overabundance of mononucleosomal fragments may indicate non-cell fragment contamination. Libraries from permeabilized cells consisted almost entirely of short fragments, suggesting that permeabilization under isotonic conditions did not loosen or release native chromatin structure at the time of tagmentation (Figure 1b , lower panels). Previous bulk ATAC-seq studies have shown that differing nuclear isolation protocols lead to varying amounts of mononucleosomal fragments (Li et al., 2019a) . In agreement with in vitro experiments studying the effects of low salt on nucleosomal arrays (Allahverdi et al., 2015) , this further suggests that hypotonic lysis leads to alteration of chromatin structure, raising the possibility of artifactual measurements of accessibility in nuclei-based ATAC-seq. To assess the effect that this difference has on the data obtained by each Figure 1 continued \u00c05 bp from the 5' and 3' ends of uniquely aligned fragments, respectively. (e) Barplot representations of the fraction of total aligned reads in various QC categories. Fragments overlapping a previously published peak set for peripheral blood mononuclear cell dscATAC-seq (Lareau et al., 2019) are in the 'Overlap Peaks' category. Unique fragments are the remaining uniquely aligned fragments that do not overlap peak regions. 'Waste' reads were not aligned or were assigned to cell barcodes with fewer than 1000 total reads.

The signal at TSS was retained in permeabilized cells, but positions flanking the TSS (occupied by neighboring nucleosomes) had reduced signal compared to isolated nuclei (examined in detail in Figure 1 -figure supplement 6). At CTCF motifs, we observed nearly identical patterns of accessibility in both nuclei and permeabilized cells, suggesting that scATAC-seq signal at regulatory TFBS is retained in permeabilized cells. Neutrophil and dead cell removal improved the quality of nuclear scATAC-seq libraries, which yielded the highest number of unique fragments, reads in TSS, and reads in peaks, though at the cost of fewer high-quality barcodes captured when compared to permeabilized cells (Table 1) . Overall, permeabilized intact cells obtained by FACS had the highest FRIP and FRITSS scores, fewest non-cell barcodes, and greatest cell capture efficiency with only a modest increase in mitochondrial reads (Table 1 , Figure 1e , f).",

            "text": "To provide ground truth for label transfer, we performed flow cytometry on an aliquot of the same PBMC sample used for scATAC-seq above. A panel of 25 antibodies (Supplementary file 3) was used to determine the proportion of each of the 12 cell types used to label the scATAC-seq cells in the PBMC sample (Figure 2-figure supplement 1 and Supplementary file 4). Label transfer was performed using the ArchR package to generate gene scores that enabled label transfer from a reference scRNA-seq dataset using the method provided in the Seurat package ) (Materials and methods). Using these tools, removal of neutrophils improved label transfer scores, and permeabilized cells yielded more cells with high label transfer scores than nuclei-based approaches (Figure 2b , c). In addition, permeabilized cells provided labels most similar to the cell-type proportions identified by flow cytometry (Figure 2d) , with identification of CD8 effector cells only observed in scATAC-seq with permeabilized cells. All methods yielded fewer CD16+ monocytes than observed by flow cytometry, suggesting that CD16+ monocytes may be lost during scATAC-seq using either nuclei or permeabilized cells, or that label transfer methods were not conducive to identifying this cell type ( Figure 2d ). After labeling cell types, we used ArchR to call peaks for each cell type and perform pairwise tests of differential accessibility between each pair of cell types ( Figure 2-figure supplement 2a) . We found many more differentially accessible sites in both cells and nuclei after removal of neutrophils. Differential accessibility was also used to identify differentially enriched TFBS motifs in each cell type ( Figure 2-figure supplement 2b) . Without neutrophil removal (nuclei unsorted, top panel), we were unable to identify significantly enriched motifs in B cells and NK cells that were readily apparent in data from clean nuclei or permeabilized cells (bottom two panels). Together, these results demonstrate that neutrophil removal and the use of permeabilized cells allow for identification of specific cell types and TFBS motifs that are involved in regulation of gene expression.

            "text": "Under standard scATAC-seq protocols, removal of the cell membrane severs the connection between the cell surface and the chromatin state of cells. To test our ability to measure cell surface proteins and chromatin state simultaneously on permeabilized cells, we modified our optimized permeabilized cell scATAC-seq methodology to incorporate measurements using commercially available barcoded antibody reagents, and we term this new method ICICLE-seq . Antibody-derived tags (ADTs) from oligo-antibody conjugates and ATAC-seq fragments can then be selectively amplified by PCR to generate separate libraries for sequencing ( Figure 3-figure supplement 1) . Due to the nature of fragment capture in this system, we obtain both a cell barcode and a single-end scATAC-seq read from the two ends of the paired-end sequencing reaction. We performed ICICLE-seq on a leukapheresis-purified PBMC sample using a 46-antibody panel (Supplementary file 6) and were able to obtain 10,227 single cells with both scATAC-seq and ADT data from three capture wells that passed adjusted QC criteria: >500 unique ATAC fragments (median = 761), FRIP >0.65 (median = 0.725). Cells passing ATAC QC had a median of 3871 ADT unique molecule indexes (UMIs) per cell (Figure 3-figure supplement 2b) . UMAP projection and ATAC label transfer on ICICLE-seq data had resolution similar to scATAC-seq on intact permeabilized cells after dead cell and debris removal ( Figure 3b ). However, the data quality was limited by the poly-A-based capture method and the single-end readout of transposed fragments. Nonetheless, the ICICLE-seq results demonstrated that permeabilized cells enabled simultaneous capture of chromatin accessibility in the nucleus and highquality cell surface epitope quantification. We were able to leverage the additional ADT data to Max. cluster median 1.7 10 2 1.3 10 3 6.7 10 2 1.8 10 2 3.0 10 2 3.0 10 0 9.0 10 0 3.4 10 1 2.1 10 2 1.0 10 3 1.3 10 2 10 2 4.7 10 2 1.8 10 2 1.0 10 2 1.4 10 1 9.3 10 1 2.7 10 1 1.9 10 2 1.2 10 3 10 3 2.2 10 3 2.3 10 2 10 2 10 1 1.2 10 2 1.3 10 3 8.0 10 1 1.2 10 3 1.4 10 1 10 1 3.0 10 2 8.7 10 2 1.2 10 2 1.4 10 2 10 1 1.8 10 2 10 1 8. 0 Source data 1.

Trimodal measurement of transcripts, epitopes, and accessibility with TEA-seq With the release of a commercially available platform for simultaneous capture of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq from single nuclei, we reasoned that permeabilized cells could be used to perform simultaneous capture of three major molecular compartments: DNA can be captured using scATAC-seq, RNA could be captured using scRNA-seq, and protein epitope abundance can be captured using polyadenylated antibody barcodes, which we term TEA-seq after Transcripts, Epitopes, and Accessibility. After trials and optimization of key steps, we were able to obtain libraries on the 10x Genomics Multiome ATAC plus Gene Expression platform that combined all three of these measurements for thousands of single cells ( Figure 4a ) using a panel of 46 oligo-tagged antibodies (Supp Table 6 ). After initial data processing for cells loaded into four wells, we identified 29,264 cell barcodes that passed the QC criteria for scATAC-seq described above and had >2,500,500 unique ATAC-seq fragments (median = 8762 unique ATAC fragments, Figure 4b , d) and had >500 genes detected by scRNA-seq (median = 2399 RNA UMIs; median = 1,249,249 genes detected, Figure 4b ), and >500 ADT UMIs (median = 1171 ADT UMIs, Figure 4c ).

For each modality, we were able to perform dimensionality reduction and UMAP projection to get separate views of the relationships between cells (Figure 4e) , as for ICICLE-seq, above (Figure 3a, b) . However, these views do not leverage the strength of linked multimodal measurements. To begin to take advantage of our tri-modal measurements, we extended a method recently described by Hao and Hao et al. for paired weighted nearest-neighbors (WNN) analysis to allow an arbitrary number of simultaneously measured modalities to contribute to the WNN network (Materials and methods). After applying this three-way WNN, we could generate a UMAP embedding with contributions from all three simultaneously measured modalities (Figure 4f ), which enhanced cell-type separation. We found that marker expression is consistent across all three modalities for some markers, such as CD8A, though we found that consistency across all modalities is not a universal characteristic of functional markers ( ",

            "text": "Identification of putative cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that control the functional state of cells is a distinct advantage of directly linked measurements of chromatin accessibility and gene expression (Cao et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2020) . This linkage is dependent on reliable detection of gene (or protein) expression, which is greatly enhanced by the high sensitivity of epitope detection in methods like CITE-seq Stoeckius et al., 2017) , and now TEA-seq. Because TEA-seq allows direct linkage of chromatin accessibility to both gene expression and protein detection, we used these complementary modalities to investigate peak-to-gene (and peak-to-protein) correlations among the proteins we measured in our TEA-seq epitope panel. We leveraged the analytical capabilities of the ArchR package to compute peak-to-gene correlation , then substituted the more sensitive measurements afforded by ADT counts to compute peak-to-protein correlations. In cases where both gene and protein expression were reliably detected, these comparisons were confirmatory -many of the same putative CRMs that were identified in each comparison ( Figure 4-figure supplement 3) . For some targets, however, more sensitive protein abundance measures allowed detection of many additional correlated CRMs. We present two examples -one of CCR2/CD192 (Figure 4g , h), a chemokine receptor expressed on monocytes (Tsou et al., 2007) ADT Only and CD38 (Figure 4i , j), a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of multiple immune cell types (Ferrero and Malavasi, 2002) , and a target of therapies for multiple myeloma (Dima et al., 2020; Sanchez et al., 2016) . In both cases, peak-to-protein correlations identified many CRMs were missed with peak-to-gene correlation alone. The converse is also observed in our experiment: reliably detected genes may enable detection of some regulatory regions that are not identified using protein detection alone -and peak-to-gene links based on scRNA-seq can be generated genomewide for all expressed genes, whether or not they are targeted by the epitope panel.",

All samples originated from the same pool of thawed and FACS sorted PBMCs (with dead cells, debris, and neutrophils removed). Separate aliquots were taken for scA-TAC-seq and the two unstained Multiome kit preps, while CITE-seq and TEA-seq samples were taken from the same pool of ADT-stained PBMCs (Figure 4-figure supplement 4a). In each case, 15,000 cells were used as input, and we downsampled a single well from the resulting libraries to equal sequencing depth for a fair comparison (200 \u00c2 10 6 total fragments per well for RNA and ATAC libraries; 48 \u00c2 10 6 for ADT libraries). We performed four wells of TEA-seq to generate a large reference dataset (shown in Figure 4 ), and one well for each other assay. For all comparisons presented in Figure 4 -figure supplement 4, we used a single well of TEA-seq. In these direct comparisons, we found that TEA-seq results appeared qualitatively similar to CITE-seq and scATAC-seq across assays ( Figure 4 -figure supplement 4b, e, i). The alignment method used for these datasets allowed us to quantify the number of RNA UMIs that aligned to intronic vs. exonic regions of the transcriptome. We found that the fraction of reads mapping to exons was lower than that found in whole-cell CITE-seq data, similar to that seen using a lysed-cell nuclei preparation (median fraction of reads with exonic mapping: TEA-seq, 51.8%, Nuclei Multiome, 52.2%; CITE-seq, 69.5% . We found that gene detection was most like nuclei and lower in many cases than CITE-seq.

In comparisons of scATAC-seq metrics, we found that TEA-seq performed comparably to standalone permeabilized cell scATAC-seq or Multiome RNA + ATAC using permeabilized cells, with higher FRIP than purified nuclei used for the same assay ( Figure 4 -figure supplement 4e, f). Finally, in comparisons of protein detection by ADTs, we found that antibody performance in TEA-seq varied by target. Many bimodal distributions were retained (e.g., CD4, CD8a, CD86), while some separations were less apparent (e.g., CD45RO and CD45RA; Figure 4 figure supplement 4h), resulting in reduced separation in UMAP analysis for some types (i.e., na\u00efve vs. mature CD4 cells), though most major cell types were able to be separated (Figure 4 -figure supplement 4i). Together, these results show that TEA-seq data is of high quality but may not always be the method of choice if a particular modality is of greatest interest to researchers. The strength of TEA-seq is its ability to measure all three aspects -transcription, epitopes, and accessibility -simultaneously on each cell, enabling deeper insights into the connections between regulation, expression, and function as demonstrated in Figure 4 .",

We found that isotonic cell permeabilization allows the generation of scATAC-seq libraries with high quality as measured by FRIP and low nucleosomal content, suggesting that chromatin state in the nucleus is unperturbed ( Figure 1, Figure 2 ). While a previous study utilized FACS followed by scATAC on individually sorted cells (Pi-ATAC; Chen et al., 2018c) , the use of permeabilized cells enables simultaneous interrogation of chromatin accessibility state in the nucleus and the functional state of cells based on their cell surface proteins (ICICLE-seq, Figure 3 ) together with mRNA (TEA-seq, Figure 4 ) at unprecedented scale for the first time. Our methods utilize permeabilized cells to allow the addition of protein measurements that provide a direct link between high-quality scRNA-seq data and scATAC-seq data using truly paired methods extending beyond SNARE-seq (Chen et al., 2019) and SHARE-seq by taking advantage of 10x Genomics Single Cell Multiome sequencing reagents as a platform for nucleic acid capture. The use of a droplet-based method allows multimodal measurements at a much higher scale by capturing thousands of single cells at a time. We expect that the datasets generated by our study will be useful beyond researchers studying PBMC biology, including those seeking to develop new analytical tools to remove background noise from existing sn/scA-TAC-seq data (e.g., SCALE, Xiong et al., 2019 , or scOpen, Li et al., 2019b and tools to accurately identify links across modalities (e.g., AI-TAC, Tasaki et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "We have focused on PBMCs during this initial development and demonstration of the utility of TEA-seq. PBMCs are a widely used source of clinically relevant heterogeneous cell populations for monitoring clinical disease status and research. As such, TEA-seq optimized for PBMCs will provide unprecedented biological insight into the molecular underpinnings of human immune health and disease. It is likely that the use of TEA-seq in other cell types will require sample-specific optimization. For example, the requirement for neutrophil depletion may be limited to studies related to the immune system or immune-infiltrated tissues. However, the value of debris and dead cell removal is likely to be applicable to disaggregated tissue samples from biopsies (Donlin et al., 2018) . Likewise, researchers should take care when assessing fragment length distributions as a quality control metric. In PBMCs, we found that high abundance of mononucleosomal fragments may indicate neutrophil-driven background, but this indicator of poor data quality may not be observed in other cell types or tissues. Early versions of nuclei-based ATAC-seq suffered issues high levels of mitochondrial reads (Corces et al., 2017) , which may be used to profile clonal populations based on their mitochondrial genomes . Here, we have used low concentrations of digitonin to selectively permeabilize cholesterol-containing membranes, thereby leaving the inner mitochondrial membrane intact (Adam et al., 1990; Colbeau et al., 1971) . Different cell types have been shown to have differing sensitivity to digitonin concentrations, perhaps reflecting natural variance in membrane cholesterol composition (Holden and Horton, 2009) . As such, cell permeabilization for TEAseq may need to be optimized for other cell types. This can be readily tested using bulk ATAC-seq and by measuring library complexity, FRIP score, and mitochondrial contamination to determine data quality.",

Neutrophils were defined as either SSC-A high /CD15+ or CD15+/CD16+. The neutrophil population defined by SSC-A high /CD15+ was larger than that defined by CD15+/CD16+ due to the presence of some contaminating CD15 low monocytes. Therefore, we used the CD45+/CD15+/CD16 + gate for subsequent analysis including summary statistics (Figure 1-figure supplement 4 and Supplementary file 2).",

Selected were ranked by their MOODS match, and the top 100,000 motifs were selected for analysis. Motif locations were expanded to a total of 4 kb centered on the middle of each CTCF motif (using the resize function from GenomicRanges in R). Fragments from cells that passed QC filtering were converted to target site duplication (TSD) center positions (+5 bp from the 5' end and \u00c04 bp from the 3' end of each fragment). All TSD centers that overlapped expanded CTCF motif regions were selected, and the number of TSD centers that overlapped each position relative to the CTCF motif was calculated (sensitive to CTCF motif strand orientation).",

BarCounter was used for single-cell ADT counting as follows: firstly, barcode sequences were compared against the 10x Genomics v3 3 0 GEX barcode whitelist (3M-february-2018.txt.gz). Sequences not included in the whitelist were corrected to a valid whitelist barcode by allowing a single base mismatch (hamming distance of 1) at a low-quality basecall (sequencing quality score <20). Reads with barcodes that could not be corrected were excluded from further analysis. Next, ADT barcode sequences were compared against a CSV taglist containing ADT barcode/antibody associations. Antibody barcodes in the current TotalSeq-A catalog (BioLegend) have a Hamming distance from all other barcodes of at least 3. Therefore, a single base mismatch (Hamming distance of 1) was allowed. Reads containing ADT sequences that could not be assigned to an antibody in the taglist were excluded. Finally, UMI sequences that were unique within their assigned ADT for their assigned cell barcode were counted. Final ADT UMI counts were written by cell barcode to a CSV file for use in downstream analysis.",

ATAC and Gene Expression libraries were prepared according to the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression User Guide (CG000338 Rev A) with several modifications.

We then separated this pool into separate aliquots for antibody staining (for CITE-seq and TEA-seq), nuclei isolation (for 10x Multiome RNA + ATAC), and two separate cell permeabilization aliquots (for scATAC-seq and 10x Multiome RNA + ATAC). scATAC-seq was performed using 0.01% digitonin permeabilization as described above. We then stained the CITE-seq and TEA-seq aliquot using the same 46 antibody panel as described above for ICICLE-seq and TEA-seq, and divided this stained pool for whole-cell CITE-seq (described below) and TEA-seq. Finally, we permeabilized the TEA-seq portion of this aliquot to perform TEA-seq as described above. For 10x Multiome RNA + ATAC libraries, we either permeabilized cells with 0.01% digitonin as describe above or purified nuclei as described by the 10x Genomics Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing Demonstrated Protocol (CG000365 Rev B). Protocol steps following sample preparation for TEA-seq or Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression were performed as described above. For Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression on nuclei or permeabilized cells, we excluded steps for ADT processing.

When applied to either nuclei (Figure 1b, left panels) or permeabilized cells (Figure 1b, right panels), there was a large increase in FRIP and reduction in non-cell barcodes in our scATAC-seq libraries (Figure 1e). Removal of neutrophils did not have an adverse effect on leukapheresis-purified PBMC data (Figure 1-figure supplement 2c, right panel). Depletion of neutrophils using anti-CD15 magnetic beads also improved data quality (Figure 1-figure supplement 2d, Figure 1-figure supplement 5), though not to the same extent as FACS-based depletion. Staining and flow cytometry using an eight-antibody panel (Supplementary file 1) on Ficoll-and leukapheresis-purified PBMCs showed minimal effect of the magnetic bead treatment on non-neutrophil cell-type abundance (Supplementary file 2).",
