The majority of newly evolving pathogens are zoonotic viruses originating from a wildlife reservoir bringing with them the potential for pandemic spread [1, 2] . The emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [3] , the re-emergence of Zika virus in the Americas [4] and most dramatically, the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 [5] [6] [7] affirm the reality of these threats. The latter further demonstrates that despite sophisticated diagnostic and detection tools, such events are poorly predictable. Thus, the overall level of preparedness has to be further improved, and novel strategies allowing a fast reaction to combat such newly emerging pathogens are urgently needed [8, 9] .",

Over the last few years, Vaccines 2021, 9, 651 2 of 23 efforts enabling an accelerated production of efficient vaccines were dominated by the development of innovative delivery platforms such as recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) [10, 11] . Due to their small size and their multivalent, highly repetitive presentation of antigens, VLPs can induce a very efficient immune response in combination with an outstanding safety profile since they lack viral genomes and are unable to cause any disease [12] [13] [14] . In addition, they are suitable for low-cost and large-scale production without the need for biosafety facilities, which can significantly accelerate manufacturing and regulatory processes.",

            "text": "In the present study, we developed a modular vaccine platform for multivalent antigen display using lumazine synthase (LS) from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus as a scaffold-protein (also designated as \"multimeric protein scaffold particle\" or \"MPSP\"). LS forms T = 1 icosahedrons with 60 subunits (PDB ID 1HQK; [15] ) and assemblies have previously been used for multimerization of antigens and as a delivery platform for dendritic cell-based vaccines or for targeted drug delivery [16] [17] [18] . In recent years, a variety of strategies have been developed and applied to present antigens on VLPs, all of them with inherent advantages and disadvantages (reviewed in [19] ). In our study, we directly compared two of these methods with regards to efficiency and potency. In the first approach, we genetically fused a peptide epitope in the self-assembling LS MPSP. In comparison, we employed a plug-and-display strategy and conjugated heterogeneously produced antigens to the pre-assembled scaffold by spontaneous isopeptide formation between the SpyCatcher (SpyC) protein and its peptide partner SpyTag (SpyT) [20, 21] . This bioconjugation method has previously been used to design diverse particulate vaccines and to enhance their efficacy [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Since its development in 2012, the resilience, reaction speed and modular reactivity of this so-called protein superglue have been improved continuously [28, 29] . The latest 003 generation allows for the binding of trimeric and even tetrameric antigens to VLPs with an exceptionally high reaction rate [30] . This novel SpyCatcher003-mi platform was also very recently used to develop a potent and promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate which induced a strong neutralizing antibody response in mice and pigs [31] .",

Based on the molecular architecture of this spike protein, we subsequently confirmed that the head domain (aa 465-702) as well as the complete headstalk domain (aa 465-874) contain the major targets of neutralizing antibodies and can provide protection from SBV infection [38] . We therefore selected these two model antigens to evaluate the SpyC/SpyT-mediated plug-and-display on LS-MPSPs. For the heterogeneous expression of Gc head (GcH) and head-stalk (GcHS) domains we used the insect cell host Drosophila S2 [39] and the thermophilic fungus C1 (Thermothelomyces heterothallica, formerly named Myceliophthora thermophila) [40] , respectively. To test the genetic fusion approach in parallel, we selected a linear peptide epitope located at the interface of the SBV Gc head and stalk domain (aa 694-708) ( Figure 1 ). Using these antigens, we designed LS MPSP-based candidate vaccines and comparatively tested their immunogenicity in vaccination-challenge studies; both in a small animal model and in cattle, one of the target species of SBV.",

For the SBV-GcH domain, cell cultures were expanded to a volume of 1.2 L (3 \u00d7 400 mL) in shaking flasks and incubated at +28 \u2022 C, 80 rpm. After 5 days each suspension culture was topped to 3 L and protein expression was induced with a final concentration of 2.5 \u00b5M CdCl 2 . Supernatants were harvested 8 days after induction by centrifugation and were subsequently concentrated to about 50 mL using a Vivaflow200 device (5000 MWCO PES; Sartorius, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). Biotin was blocked by addition of BioLock (iba lifesciences, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) as recommended. The concentrated supernatant was then purified using Streptactin-Superflow high capacity slurry (iba lifesciences, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) according to the manufacturer s protocol. All protein-containing eluates were pooled, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until further use. C-terminal Strep-Tags were not removed from the final constructs. SBV Gc core, AKAV-GcH and the SBV Gc stalk 1 domain were expressed and purified as described above but in smaller volumes (700-800 mL).",

Using a 3-fold molar excess of SpyT-antigen allowed for conjugating the maximal number of antigens fitting on the LS surface (saturated particles). However, in this approach the amount of effectively conjugated antigen has to be determined by densitometric analysis since about 30-50% remain unconjugated and have to be removed from the final reaction product by dialysis. In contrast, the production of particles with a low conjugation efficiency (10-50% of SpyC-subunits conjugated) promotes binding of all provided antigens obviating a final purification step. This strategy required a 1.5 to 3-fold excess of LS-SpyC subunits compared to antigens. Since here, the amount of conjugated antigen equals the input, a subsequent quantification by WB is not necessary.",

In mice, our candidate peptide #2 fused to LS (LS-Pept2) conferred protection from an otherwise lethal challenge dose in all of the vaccinated animals. However, it failed to induce a protective immune response in cattle, a main target species of SBV. Based on the previously resolved crystal structure of the SBV spike, the peptide epitope is located at the suggested flexible interface between the Gc head and stalk domain [38] . Thus, it can be presented in different conformations at the virion surface. In contrast, the LSfused peptide is displayed only in one specific (and potentially artificial) orientation. Thus, antibodies induced after vaccination might not be able to access the native epitope and consequently lack neutralizing capacity. In order to optimize the efficacy of the LS-peptide vaccines, all LS-fused epitopes detected by Pepscan analysis could be applied together as a cocktail to induce a broader antibody response and to improve immunogenicity in target species. The discordant, superior performance of the LS-Pept2 vaccine in the IFNAR-/-mouse model most likely reflects the species-specific diversity in B-cell and antibody repertoires [53] . This finding further underscores the value of investigating the efficacy of candidate vaccines in target species early in vaccine development.",

Thus, its immunogenicity is comparable to that of GcH expressed in mammalian HEK293T cells [37, 38] . The GcHS domain was produced using the C1 fungal system in order to assess the potential of this technology to produce immunogenic proteins. The C1 technology was initially developed for large scale and high yield expression of industrial enzymes, but current efforts focus on the manufacturing of biologicals and drugs [40, 56] . It has been shown that N-glycosylation in C1 enzymes does not include as large high-mannose glycan structures as found in Aspergillus species [54, 57] or the hyperglycosylated N-glycan structures found in several yeast species. The C1-produced GcHS induced a highly protective immune response in both mice and cattle. Presented on LS-particles, it even conferred complete clinical protection after a single shot immunization in mice. Thus, this technology represents a promising strategy for a cost-effective, flexible and high-yield production of therapeutic recombinant proteins.",

            "text": "It has already been demonstrated that a tetravalent dengue virus subunit vaccine stimulates an immune response against each serotype [58] , and orthogonal display on IMX313 scaffolds improved the generation of antibodies against both of the presented proteins [23] . A co-delivery of additional immunostimulatory elements, e.g., T-cell epitopes on the same scaffold, represents another attractive feature for improving the quality and duration of the antibody response [13, 59, 60] . Even though, presentation of GcH and GcHS on the LS scaffold markedly improved their efficacy, protection was still dependent on the application of an adjuvant, as it has been reported repeatedly for non-infectious particulate vaccines [61, 62] . We demonstrated that the conjugation level of different antigens to the LS is dependent on the molar ratio of antigen::LS-SpyC subunits supplied in the reactions. In the majority of similar studies, the antigen was provided in a 1.5-to 3-fold molar excess in order to conjugate the maximum amount of SpyC-subunits and to produce homogeneous particles [22] [23] [24] [25] 29, 63] . However, in the context of newly emerging pathogens, the production process for each antigen has to be started from the beginning. Consequently, the generation of antigen-saturated particles that require very high amounts of recombinant proteins inevitably slows down the development process. In contrast, the bacterially expressed LS-scaffold can be easily produced at a large scale and stockpiled until use. The manufacturing of unsaturated particles therefore represents a cheaper and less time-consuming approach. It has been reported that even particles with a conjugation level of only 10% can raise an efficient antibody response after booster vaccination [26] . In order to verify these results for our vaccine candidates, we directly compared the potency of LS MPSPs with high and low antigen conjugation levels. In our studies, both preparations performed equally well and protected >80% of the vaccinated animals from clinical signs of disease even after a one-shot application. Thus, at least in the present work, an increase in the antigen density on the LS-scaffold was not beneficial with regard to immunogenicity. We hypothesize that the small size of the antigen-loaded particles already promotes B-cell receptor crosslinking, an efficient drainage to lymph nodes and a rapid uptake by antigenpresenting cells. Therefore, it may not be necessary to saturate MPSPs with proteins to elicit an optimal immune response. This is supported by the previous finding that an enhanced antigen concentration per particle affects vaccine efficacy only when the actual antigen dose is increased [64] . When using a platform for presentation of antigens to the immune system, it is relevant to consider if pre-existing immunity, or an immune response elicited by the scaffold upon (repeated) vaccination, could compromise vaccine efficacy. Since LS is derived from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, pre-existing immunity against the LS scaffold or the bacterial superglue components is unlikely to exist in animal or human populations. Interestingly, Howarth et al. recently showed that a potential impact of antibodies against components of SpyC and SpyT can be prevented by using the novel SpyC/SpyT 003 pair [30] . Nevertheless, it is presently unclear if immune responses elicited by LS upon vaccination could compromise the repeated use of this scaffold. Theoretically, an immune response against the scaffold elicited by a first vaccination could either have an adjuvanting effect (providing T-cell help) or could result in increased clearance. Previous studies found that anti-carrier antibodies can indeed affect the immune response against the presented antigen [59, 65] . However, it was also demonstrated that high levels of antigen-specific antibodies can be induced despite a pre-existing carrier immune response [65] . In our study, animals vaccinated with LS-conjugated antigens developed varying amounts of anti-scaffold antibodies as was observed previously in a MERS-CoV model [60] . However, we could not observe obvious interference of the anti-LS antibodies with the immune response against the MPSP-displayed antigen. In mice, protection from clinical signs of disease could be improved using a prime-boost regimen, and in cattle, boosting had no impact on the development of high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, the effect of several booster applications will have to be evaluated in the future using different antigens displayed on the same LS-MPSP.",

The capacity to induce such a rapid and sound immune response is an important quality in preventing the spread of an emerging pathogen and is remarkable, considering the non-infectious nature of the MPSP vaccines. Since the animals were vaccinated twice with a 14 day interval, it remains unknown if a single application would be also sufficient to elicit protective immunity. However, a one-shot immunization with the same LS-displayed antigens protected about 80% of IFNAR-/-mice from clinical signs of disease after inoculation with an otherwise lethal challenge dose. Using the cattle model, we demonstrated before that among inactivated SBV prototype vaccines [68] , the SBV Gc head domain, either as a HEK293T-produced recombinant subunit or delivered by a Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector [37, 69] , confers sterile immunity after a prime-and-boost application. Nevertheless, none of these previously tested vaccines induced a robust level of neutralizing antibodies prior to a booster vaccination. This further highlights the high potential of an antigen display on LS MPSPs to enhance and accelerate the onset of a protective immune response. Further animal studies will validate these results in more detail in the future.",
