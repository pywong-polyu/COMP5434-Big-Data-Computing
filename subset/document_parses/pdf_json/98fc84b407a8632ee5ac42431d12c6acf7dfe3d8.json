Such an approach makes excellent use of the inbred nature of most laboratory mouse lines, in which uniform homozygosity often reveals the effects of recessive alleles at loci whose wild-type alleles prevent neoplastic transformation. The use of inbred stocks to screen for cancer-prone alleles has some limitations, however, including the possibility that the phenotype may depend upon a specific combination of recessive alleles that may be unlikely to occur together except in the context of deliberate inbreeding. The historical development of mouse genetics, linked for many years to the retention and selection of mouse stocks with unusually high tumor incidence, is also likely to have favored the detection of rare allele combinations of this kind.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "For several years, we have been seeking evidence for polymorphic genes that modulate life span and age-sensitive traits in a four-way cross between four of the common laboratory inbred stocks.

Key features included at least daily inspection for recent deaths (typically twice a day for 5 days each week), and a willingness to euthanize mice that appeared so severely ill that survival for more than a few additional days seemed unlikely. This system allowed us to obtain informative necropsies on more than 90% of the mice in this study (excluding those culled for fighting or because of errors in record-keeping or mouse husbandry). An attempt was made to infer a most likely cause of death in each case, and this was possible in 886 of the 1004 cases evaluated. In the other 118 cases, no single cause of death could be assigned, either (a) because advanced tissue autolysis prevented evaluation, (b) because two or more lesions were judged to have contributed to death or moribund state, or (c) in a small number of cases, because no lesion serious enough to have caused death could be identified.

There is evidence of unanticipated differences in pathology between the LAG1 and LAG2 cohorts. Mouse urinary syndrome, for example, was common among males in the LAG1 group, but not noted in the LAG2 males. In addition, we found unexpectedly that fibrosarcoma was frequently a cause of death in the LAG1 and BCA mice (18% of virgin females and 5% of virgin males), but was infrequent in the LAG2 series (3% of virgin females and 1% of virgin males). Conversely, hemangiosarcoma was rare in the LAG1 group (3% and 1% in females and males, respectively), but much more common in LAG2 (13% and 10%, respectively). These variations in lesion prevalence may reflect subtle environmental differences under which the cohorts of mice were raised. It is also apparent that the proportion of mice dying of mammary adenocarcinoma was far higher among multiparous females (24% of diagnosable cases) than for virgin females (9%), consistent with previous assessments of the effects of hormonal environment on mammary cancer in mice. A qualitative trait locus (QualTL) mapping procedure was then used to seek evidence for loci at which allelic differences modulated the likelihood of specific causes of death. Results for which experiment-wise p , .10 are summarized in the first five lines of Table 3 . Four of these met the criterion of p , .05, the preselected significance threshold for the protocol, and one (the maternal allele of D11Mit156 as a predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma) was suggestive but not definitive at p \u00bc .09. For hepatocellular carcinoma and lymphoma, the calculations involved data from both male and female mice pooled together. Because the risk of mammary adenocarcinoma differs between multiparous and virgin females, the calculation for this cause of death was done three times, once for multiparous females (BCA cohort only), once for virgin females (LAG1 and LAG2 cohorts), and once for all females regardless of mating status. Only the multiparous females showed a significant genetic effect, which is therefore listed in Table  3 . The genome scan found no significant QualTL for hemangiosarcoma or for fibrosarcoma, but did find a strong association between D4Mit170p on mouse chromosome 4 and the likelihood that the mouse would die either of fibrosarcoma or hemangiosarcoma, considering these two histologically distinct lesions as a single combined category. Figure 1 illustrates the strength of association between alleles of D1Mit206 and D4Mit84 and the risk of dying because of lymphoma. For each of these loci, inheriting the D2 allele gives a substantially increased risk of death by lymphoma. The two effects are additive; as shown in the bottom panel of the figure, mice that inherit the D2 allele at both loci have a 36% chance of dying from lymphoma, compared to a 13% chance for mice that inherit the C3 allele at both loci. Figure 2 illustrates the strength of association between alleles at D4Mit55 and the risk of mammary adenocarcinoma death in multiparous female mice. The C3 allele at this locus increases the risk of death from breast cancer from 12% to 34%. When the outcome was ''incidental'' mammary adenocarcinoma, that is, the presence of this lesion at necropsy regardless of inferred cause of death, the incidence rates were 15% and 45%, respectively, a difference of threefold. No locus reached significance when the calculations included only virgin female mice, or when the group of virgin and multiparous female animals was evaluated together. For virgin females, the risk of death from mammary adenocarcinoma was 6.8% (12/176) in mice with the C3 allele at D4Mit55, and 6.7% (13/193) in mice with the D2 allele.

The basis for the increased risk of mammary adenocarcinoma in multiparous as compared to virgin female mice is not understood, and contrasts with the relation between mammary cancer risk and child-bearing in humans. It seems likely that the locus on chromosome 4 modulates the factors, presumably hormonal, that increase mammary cancer risk in multiparous female mice, although it is noteworthy that mating increases the risk of breast cancer (from 6.7% to 12%) even in mice that inherit the low-risk allele at D4Mit55.

There are two potential confounding factors: (a) slides from the LAG2 mice were not evaluated by the same individual responsible for evaluating the LAG1 and BCA cohorts; and (b) the two groups of animals were produced and raised several years apart, and might therefore have been exposed, inadvertently, to different dietary or environmental influences. Comparison of a sample of cases with these lesions from each of the two necropsy series confirmed that they were indeed histologically distinct. Angiosarcoma in humans has been noted to exhibit microscopic heterogeneity; in one series, for example (16) , all cases were reported to have focal vasoformative components similar to those in hemangiosarcomas in the LAG2 cohort, but 7% of the cases also contained solid components resembling the fibrosarcoma seen in the LAG1/BCA mice. Although it is possible that sampling at necropsy resulted in systematic differences in lesion presentation between the two series of cases, we do not consider this a likely explanation for the disparity. The second possibility is that the difference in lesion presentation was due to unknown environmental factor(s) that were different for the two groups of mice. We suspect that some unknown variation in environmental conditions between 1995 and 1998, such as an inadvertent change in the composition of the natural products diet or some alteration in water quality, may have led to the reciprocal increase in vascular neoplasia and reduction in fibrosarcoma risk, but we cannot put this idea to any immediate test. Our genetic results show that an allele linked to D4Mit170 in the BALB/c genome leads to a two-fold increase in risk of hemangiosarcoma and fibrosarcoma compared to the corresponding B6 allele.
