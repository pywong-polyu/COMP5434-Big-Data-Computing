Urchins are an unusually good system, in which, to study size effects because individuals of various ages within one species span four orders of magnitude in weight while retaining a nearly isometric morphology. We tracked growth of urchins, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (0.013-161.385 g), in the presence or absence of waterborne cues from predatory Jonah crabs, Cancer borealis. We ran experiments at ambient temperatures, once for 4 weeks during summer and again, with a second set of urchins, for 22 weeks over winter. We used a scaled, cube-root transformation of weight for measuring size more precisely and for equalizing variance across sizes. Growth rate of the smallest urchins (summer: \\17 mm diameter; winter: \\7 mm diameter) decreased by 40-42% in response to crab cues. In contrast, growth rate of larger urchins was unaffected in the summer and increased in response to crab scent by 7% in the winter. At the end of the 22-week experiment, additional gonadal and skeletal variables were measured. Cue-exposed urchins developed heavier, thicker skeletons and smaller gonads, but no differences in spine length or jaw size. The differences depended on urchin size, suggesting that there are sizespecific shifts in gonadal and somatic investment in urchins.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Communicated by M.

Initial and final nominal diameters are the covariates for growth analyses (change in nominal diameter) and skeletal analyses (all other variables), respectively. Least-squares linear regression analyses, such as ANCOVA, are appropriate when measurement error in the independent variable is negligible; however, problems arise if variance in measurement of the independent variable is substantial (Warton et al. 2006) . Specifically, significant error in the measurement of the independent variable results in the underestimation of the slope for allometric relationships with a low r 2 (LaBarbera 1989). Thus, either the absence of significant measurement error needs to be established or measurement error has to be estimated and used to adjust the analysis. Reduced major axis estimates are often used to avoid such underestimation of the slope; however, the use of reduced major axis can yield meaningless results, such as a slope between two uncorrelated variables (Harvey and Pagel 1991) . The simplest way to determine whether measurement error creates problems in the analysis is to make multiple measurements of the independent variable. If repeated measurements of the independent variable are highly correlated then the bias in the slope due to measurement error will be small (Warton et al. 2006) . The independent variable for all of the analyses above is nominal diameter, which is a size proxy for our measured variable, weight. We use the reliability ratio, j (where j = r, and r is the correlation between repeated measurements of a variable ; Fuller 1987) to estimate the measurement error in weight. The slope corrected for the measurement error is the slope obtained from the regression divided by the reliability ratio, j. To determine j, we made three separate measurements of weight (to the neareast 0.001 g) on 50 S. droebachiensis ranging in size from 0.031 to 88.558 g and converted these weights to nominal diameter. We find that j = 0.9999 for all pairwise linear regressions between separate measurements of nominal diameter. Thus, slopes of ANCOVA analyses using nominal diameter as the independent variable are not adjusted for error in the independent variable. ANCOVA first tests for common regression slopes among treatment groups. When slopes do not differ significantly, then ANCOVA tests for differences in elevations. When slopes do differ, a posteriori pairwise comparisons of slopes and intercepts are assessed using Tukey's q test (Zar 1996, pp. 367-368) . When slopes are parallel, the common slope is used to plot the regression lines shown in figures; when there are no differences in slopes or intercepts, the common slope and common intercept are used to plot the regression lines shown in figures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 651, "end": 671, "text": "(Warton et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 1224, "end": 1247, "text": "(Harvey and Pagel 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1562, "text": "(Warton et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1814, "text": ";", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1827, "text": "Fuller 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2726, "end": 2749, "text": "(Zar 1996, pp. 367-368)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gonad and skeletal measurements"}, {"text": "We separate our analyses of growth into three phases based on the Tanaka function, which is a function that is often used to fit urchin growth (Ebert and Russell 1993; Russell et al. 1998; Ebert et al. 1999; Russell 2001; Ebert 2001; Johnson et al. 2002; Ebert 2008) .

Similarly, urchins 6-10 mm (Hereu et al. 2005 ) and 25-30 mm (Scheibling and Hamm 1991) in diameter were consumed at higher rates than urchins 2-6 mm in erect algal assemblages or on cobbles, respectively.

For example, both increased spine length (Raymond and Scheibling 1987; Johnson, Ellers and Davies, unpublished data) and increased jaw height (Edwards and Ebert 1991; Levitan 1991) can occur in response to food limitation. However, the increased skeletal weight of our urchins was due only to thickening of skeletal plates. Energy reallocation towards skeletal thickening could have contributed to the decreased growth rates observed in small urchins and to smaller gonads, but was additional to the increased growth rate of the mid-sized urchins. This latter result supports the hypothesis that skeletal thickening was not just due to reduced somatic growth consequent to reduced foraging, but also in part to direct morphogenetic responses to cueing (for snails see : Palmer 1990; Brookes and Rochette 2007; Edgell and Neufeld 2008) . For post-metamorphic urchins, this is the first time it has been shown that predator cues can induce changes that impact shell form. Plate thickening presumably strengthens the skeleton. Urchin skeletons consist of arrays of plates sutured together with a combination of calcitic, stereomic projections and collagenous ligaments. The strength of the skeleton depends on the strength of the individual plates themselves and on the strength of the sutures holding the plates together. Assuming the material strength of the skeletal calcite remains similar, the greater cross-sectional area of thicker skeletal plates provides increased structural strength making individual plates less likely to break. In growing urchins, sutural calcite is replaced by sutural ligaments, which increases the strength of urchin skeletons (Ellers et al. 1998 ). Increasing the cross-sectional area of skeletal plates also provides more attachment area for the collagenous sutural ligaments, generating greater potential sutural strength. Thus, by thickening skeletal plates, urchins produce stronger, more crush-resistant skeletons.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 352, "end": 381, "text": "(Raymond and Scheibling 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 382, "end": 427, "text": "Johnson, Ellers and Davies, unpublished data)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 453, "end": 477, "text": "(Edwards and Ebert 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 478, "end": 491, "text": "Levitan 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1093, "text": ": Palmer 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1120, "text": "Brookes and Rochette 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1145, "text": "Edgell and Neufeld 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1968, "end": 1987, "text": "(Ellers et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 233, "end": 240, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 256, "end": 263, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Skeletal and reproductive changes"}, {"text": "Some responses to crab effluent diminished with increasing urchin size: (1) there are no significant changes in growth rate for urchins larger than 17 mm nominal diameter in the 4 week study (Fig. 1a) , (2) differences in gonad indices diminish for urchins larger than 25 mm nominal diameter or three grams total AFDW (Fig. 2b, d) and (3) differences in skeletal ashed weights and SI diminish for urchins greater than 25 mm nominal diameter (Fig. 3a, b) .

In S. droebachiensis, stronger avoidance responses were elicited by waterborne cues from wolf-fish fed a diet of urchins than from a crab (C. pagurus) fed a diet of urchins; behavioral responses to both predators weakened when the predator's diet was mussels (Hagen et al. 2002) . The intensity of indirect responses to predators can depend not only on cue type, but also on cue intensity. For example, S. droebachiensis responded less strongly to water conditioned with extracts of crushed conspecifics when it was diluted (Hagen et al. 2002) . Increased predator density or size could increase the intensity of the cue; conversely, increased density of conspecifics might decrease the intensity of prey response (for a model, see Peacor 2003) . For example, N. lamellosa exposed to waterborne cues from big (83-104 mm carapace width) C. productus grew more slowly and had thicker shells than those exposed to cues from small (46-70 mm carapace width) C. productus (Edgell and Neufeld 2008) .

Vermeij (2002) argued that shell thickness and sculpture are negatively correlated with growth rate and that growth rate in turn is constrained by the availability of energy for metabolismpowered processes.
