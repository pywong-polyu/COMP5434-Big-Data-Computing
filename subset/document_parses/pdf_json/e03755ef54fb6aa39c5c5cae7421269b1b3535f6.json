            "text": "Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune condition that causes patchy hair loss, affecting up to 147 million people globally. Currently, there are no treatments approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specific for AA, and there are few effective therapeutic options for widespread and persistent illness. There is an ongoing need for a treatment that demonstrates a good clinical response with a benefit-risk ratio that is suitable for long-term use, especially for patients with chronic, extensive disease. Several clinical trials and case studies that have assessed Janus kinase inhibitors have had encouraging results. Ritlecitinib, a selective JAK3/ TEC kinase inhibitor has been demonstrated to inhibit the action of signaling molecules and immune cells that are responsible for hair loss in people with alopecia areata. Furthermore, several clinical trials are investigating the utility of ritlecitinib in patients with vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Advantages of using ritlecitinib when compared with other nonselective JAK inhibitors include avoiding JAK1/JAK2 inhibition's clinical repercussions, which include pharmacodynamic effects such as increased cholesterol and liver enzymes, and those related to JAK2 inhibition (thrombocytopenia, anemia). Treatment with Ritlecitinib 50 mg and 30 mg daily for 24 weeks has been shown to induce hair regrowth with a significant proportion of patients reaching SALT 20 (\u226420% scalp hair loss) after six months of therapy compared to placebo. Additional research is needed for long-term effects.",

[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] For many patients, AA is associated with a poor health-related quality of life, which can lead to psychological repercussions such as anxiety and depression. 1 There are currently no FDA or European Medicines Agency approved medications for AA, and effective therapeutic options for widespread or chronic AA are limited. 2 There is an unmet need for a consistently effective treatment with a benefit-risk ratio suitable for long-term usage for severe AA, especially for patients with chronic, extensive disease. 10 Ritlecitinib is the first member of a new class of covalent kinase inhibitors with remarkable selectivity for Janus kinase 3 (JAK3).

Finally, JAK signals encourage immune cells to generate cytokines, resulting in the chronic inflammation that characterizes autoimmune diseases.

As a result, AA is characterized by deregulation of JAK/STAT activity, specifically the \u03b3c cytokine and IFN-\u03b3 signaling pathways. 2, 15 Upregulation of interleukin (IL)-15 in hair follicles leads to the recruitment and activation of natural killer, gene 2Dexpressing CD81 T cells, this results in the production of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) with consequent loss of hair follicle immune privilege. 15, 17, 18 In addition, Dr Christiano et al have demonstrated that patients who received oral ruxolitinib, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, have experienced near-complete hair regrowth, hinting that this tailored therapy may have clinical utility. 15 ",

This drug, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is also in clinical trials as an oral treatment for psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. 19 Tofacitinib, a JAK1/JAK2/ JAK3 inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. Tofacitinib is currently in clinical trials for systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sjogren's syndrome, Takayasu arteritis, diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, and dermatomyositis. 19 Baricitinib, a JAK1/ JAK2 inhibitor, is approved for rheumatoid arthritis and is currently in clinical trials for systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, primary Sjogren\u00b4s syndrome, and psoriasis. 19 The European Union has approved upadacitinib, 19 Filgotinib, a JAK1 selective inhibitor, is approved in the European Union and Japan for rheumatoid arthritis, is also being studied for Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and Sjogren's syndrome. It is also being studied for Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and Sjogren's syndrome. 19 Peficitinib a Pan-JAK inhibitor is approved in Japan and South Korea for rheumatoid arthritis, and is also in clinical trials for psoriasis, and ulcerative colitis. 19 The FDA issued a JAK inhibitor (baricitinib) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients on November 19, 2020. 20 Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors offer robust scientific evidence to support their usage in AA, and an increasing number of favorable clinical trials show their efficacy in hair regrowth. JAK inhibitors are already making their way into expertauthored therapy algorithms for the management of AA, despite the fact that they are not yet expressly approved for this condition. Tofacitinib (JAK1/JAK3) and ruxolitinib (JAK1/JAK2) have been demonstrated through open-label clinical trial data in individuals with AA to help reverse hair loss. [21] [22] [23] In an open-label study of 66 patients, 22 where the JAK1/3 inhibitor tofacitinib was administered twice daily, around one-third of patients showed \u226550% improvement from baseline, as determined by the severity of alopecia tool (SALT) score after three months of treatment, with side effects restricted to mild infections. 22 In a retrospective analysis of 90 patients treated with tofacitinib, around 66-70% of patients achieved hair regrowth, this result depended on the dose received. 24 This study also found that hair regrowth was unlikely in patients who had experienced complete or near-complete scalp hair loss for at least ten years. 24 Tofacitinib may be effective in adolescents, according to another study. 25 Another study with ruxolitinib, 26 a JAK1/2 inhibitor, revealed that 9 out of 12 patients achieved total or nearcomplete scalp hair regrowth after 6 months of treatment. 26 Furthermore, a study indicated that low-dose ruxolitinib was just as effective as higher-dose ruxolitinib for treating severe AA. 27 Notes: \"+\" indicates inhibitory effect.

Similar results have also been observed in NK cells. 34 The dual activity of ritlecitinib toward JAK3 and the TEC kinase family may provide a beneficial inhibitory profile for therapeutic intervention based on the underlying pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, vitiligo, and AA. 34, 42 In a study performed by Robinson et al 43 where 70 patients received Ritlecitinib, only 9 patients reported mild treatment-related adverse effects, among them, it was found mild lymphopenia, mild hepatotoxicity, arthralgias, peripheral edema, pruritus and 1 patient reported suicidal ideation that resolved with treatment withdrawal. 43 The most common adverse effects continued to be infections and infestations, influenza occurred in 7.1% of patients, and 1 case of herpes simplex was reported. 43 No patient developed bleeding events, platelet count reductions of 100 x 10 3 /mm 3 , or clinically significant symptoms of anemia or hemodynamic compromise. 43 Ritlecitinib performed better when evaluated for adverse effects related to cell counts, thrombopoiesis, and erythropoiesis in comparison with previously studied JAK2 inhibitors. 43 The pharmacokinetics of ritlecitinib in humans are predicted to be as follows: The drug has a blood clearance of 5.6 mL/ min/kg, a steady-state volume of distribution of 1.3 L/kg, a 90% oral bioavailability, and a systemic half-life of 2 hours. 42",

Eyelash improvement was reported in 81% of patients, and 72% reported eyebrow improvement. 11 In this study, AASIS, an internally consistent patient-reported outcome measurement tool, was also used to assess AA-related symptoms and their impact on daily functioning. 11 The improvement in AASIS scores (\u221210.8 [90% CI, \u221215.6, \u22125.9]) after 24 weeks in the active treatment groups, but not in the control group, suggests a significant improvement in patients' quality of life after treatment with ritlecitinib.",

Following withdrawal and retreatment, there was a loss of efficacy based on SALT 30 compared with the initial response in the DB period. SALT 30 was only achieved by 57% of patients receiving ritlecitinib and 53% receiving PF-06700841 who had initially achieved SALT 30 on active treatment. 51 Nonresponders who continued treatment for another 24 weeks were unlikely to respond during this extension study. 51 Ritlecitinib continued to be generally safe and well tolerated, including in the Nonresponders group (from the initial DB period) who received 24 additional weeks of the same active treatment. 51 Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2022:16 https://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S334727",

Upper respiratory tract and nasal infections are the most common ones, which occur in more than 10% of patients. 53 Less common infections include tuberculosis, 52 herpes simplex, herpes zoster, 53 and oral candidiasis. Some patients may be at a higher risk of developing cancer. Tofacitinib, a non-selective JAK1/JAK2/JAK3 inhibitor, for example, inhibits the signaling of several cytokines, including type I and type II interferons, and reduces the number of NK cells, both of which are important in the elimination of transformed cells in cancer. 54, 55 From 5677 adult patients who participated in Phase II, phase III, and long-term studies of tofacitinib, 107 patients developed malignancies, the most common were lung cancer (n = 24), breast cancer (n = 19), lymphomas (n = 10), and gastric cancer (n = 6). 55 With the development of JAK3 inhibitors, the JAK1 inhibition-related neoplasms could diminish, although the data from longterm studies are still missing. 56, 57 JAK inhibitors may affect cholesterol levels, (Table 4) 58 and the health-care provider may need to prescribe a statin drug. Blood clots can form, increasing the likelihood of cardiovascular events, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis. 59 Liver damage is also a possible adverse reaction with JAK inhibitor use, and finally, these drugs are contraindicated in patients with diverticulitis, as they can lead to viscous perforation. 56, 57 The FDA recently issued a warning about the increased risk of heart-related events, such as heart attack or stroke, as well as cancer and death, associated with the use of tofacitinib (Xeljanz \u00ae ), baricitinib (Olumiant \u00ae ), and upadacitinib (Rinvoq \u00ae ). 60 ",

The selective inhibition of JAK3 over other kinases may lead to a more favorable adverse effect profile than other JAK1/JAK2-panJAK inhibitors. Additional studies for long-term effects are warranted.",
