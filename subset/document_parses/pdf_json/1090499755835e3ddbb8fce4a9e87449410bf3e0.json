Another study based on the data of 154 elderly patients with COVID-19 from 26 provinces of China showed that age was an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted odds ra-tio=1.04) [20] . In our study, the death rate in elderly patients was higher than that in younger patients, but was not statistically significant. The reason may be related to the small sample size of our study and that we were missing outcome data on 3 patients at the final date of follow-up. In the present cohort, comorbidities and ICU admissions were more frequent in elderly patients, which is consistent with studies from China and other countries with severe epidemics [4, 5, 8, [23] [24] [25] .

In our study, elderly patients have a lower ICU admission rate because we included severe and nonsevere patients in our study population. It is also notable that elderly patients were more likely to develop a myocardial injury than younger patients, which may be associated with a higher number of elderly patients having underlying cardiovascular diseases and becoming critically ill, although the underlying mechanisms involved are uncertain.
