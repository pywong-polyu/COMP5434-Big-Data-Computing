            "text": "Since early 2000s, the fine art market has made significant progress exhibiting its dynamic characters, with a 1370% turnover growth rate over a 16-year period [1] . Artprice with the collaboration of its Chinese State partner AMMA (Art Market Monitor of Artron), reported that, in 2020, the art market fell 21% down to $10.57 billion [2] . This was a surprisingly small contraction given the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the art market as a whole (galleries, museums, fairs, etc.) [2] . Considering the above, it is not surprising that the number of fakes, forgeries and copies emerging on the art market in recent years is significant and fast growing [3, 4] . Fine art authentication is a lucrative business. The opinions of well-established experts are rarely challenged [3] , since forgers, by nature, prefer anonymity. However, the number of cases where confirmation of art authenticity has turned into a nightmare for an expert is on the rise. The unique story of Han van Meegeren, who is recognized as one of the most ingenious forgers of the 20th century, can be used as an example [5, 6] . Just with fakes based on Vermeer, the forger amassed a fortune worth more than half a billion dollars in today's currency. His work might have been still attributed to others if not for a cruel twist where he admitted to the forgeries in order to avoid being accused of collaborating with Nazis. History has delivers several other profiles of ingenious forgers, with the most recent one named Wolfgang Beltracchi [7] . This German painter confessed to forging hundreds of paintings in an international art scam netting millions of euros. In 2011, he was sentenced to six years in prison and, just overnight, became the celebrity called by the media \"a forger of the century\" [7, 8] .",

An in-depth analysis of the documentation associated with the art in question can assist in formulation of the final assessment.

The set was attributed to Joseph Jeremias Knechtl, one of the most famous painters of the 18th century in Silesia (Poland) who was nearly completely forgotten in the following centuries.

For the study, the art historian selected paintings representing all periods of Knechtl's creativity. They were subjected to noninvasive analyses like X-ray ; IR reflectography; UV fluorescence and complementary examinations using micro-Raman spectroscopy, micro-ART spectroscopy, HPLC (highpressure liquid chromatography), optical microscopy and SEM-EDS examinations. The information obtained for the representative set selected by the art historian allowed the creation of a \"database\" of painting materials used by Knechtl.

Since the first two steps of the process could not confirm the attribution of the painting called \"Bolko II\u015awidnicki\", a comprehensive comparative study implementing microscopic and spectroscopic analytical techniques was performed in order to authenticate. For the study, the art historian selected paintings representing all periods of Knechtl's creativity. They were subjected to noninvasive analyses like X-ray; IR reflectography; UV fluorescence and complementary examinations using micro-Raman spectroscopy, micro-ART spectroscopy, HPLC (high-pressure liquid chromatography), optical microscopy and SEM-EDS examinations. The information obtained for the representative set selected by the art historian allowed the creation of a \"database\" of painting materials used by Knechtl. The database was then used as a validation tool for investigation of the painting whose authenticity was questioned.",

They are listed in Table 1 . The application of attribution markers in authenticity assessments is fairly new, and many of the markers need detailed explanations, since their meanings are not well-established yet. For example, a marker called \"verification of the artistic style\" means that an art historian performed a robust analysis of the artistic style of the painting in question. \"Historical pigments\" indicates that pigments and dyes identified in the analyzed piece of art were consistent with the supposed time of creation of the investigated object. \"Stratigraphy\" implies that the stratigraphy of the sample collected from the analyzed painting was compared to the samples originating from a painting of known provenance and attribution. \"Distinctive value\", also referred to a \"fingerprint\" of the painter, refers to the unique feature of the painting technique or the specific material used by the painter. The marker \"accessory minerals\" attests to the origin of the raw materials used in the ground layer [29] . One of the markers listed in Table 1 and called \"state consistent\" is highly unique, since it is not determined by any analytical technique. It indicates the overall consistency of all available data, like materials, technique, preservation, etc., with the known facts about the expected creator. For example, the gathered data have not delivered any information contradicting the authenticity, but the craquelure does not look like the original or the varnish seems to be quite fresh, regardless of exhibiting the expected type of fluorescence. A similar factor is used in the assisted diagnostics [41] . ",
