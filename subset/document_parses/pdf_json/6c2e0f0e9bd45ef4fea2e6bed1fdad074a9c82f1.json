            "text": "Various COVID-19 vaccines have been or are about to be approved for use in the population in many countries. More vaccines are expected to be approved in the future. These vaccines use different technologies and have been developed in different ways. For instance, both the vaccine developed by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer together with the research centre BioNTech (henceforth, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine) and the one developed by the pharmaceutical company Moderna use a novel mRNA technology. The vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and produced by the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca (henceforth, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine) and the one produced by Abstract We discuss whether and under what conditions people should be allowed to choose which COVID-19 vaccine to receive on the basis of personal ethical views. The problem arises primarily with regard to some religious groups' concerns about the connection between certain COVID-19 vaccines and abortion. Vaccines currently approved in Western countries make use of foetal cell lines obtained from aborted foetuses either at the testing stage (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines) or at the development stage (Oxford/ AstraZeneca vaccine). The Catholic Church's position is that, if there are alternatives, Catholic people have a moral obligation to request the vaccine whose link with abortion is more remote, which at present means that they should refuse the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. We argue that any consideration regarding free choice of the vaccine should apply to religious and non-religious claims alike, in order to avoid religion-based discrimination. However, we also argue that, in a context of Johnson&Johnson use an adenovirus technique 1 . Like many other vaccines already widely used (e.g. against rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis A, and shingles), some of the current and likely of the future vaccines, including the Oxford/AstraZeneca and the Johnson&Johnson vaccines, have been developed by using cells that were replicated from HEK-293 cell lines obtained from foetuses after elective abortions. The abortions took place in the early 1970s, but as with most cell lines derived from aborted foetuses for research purposes in those years, little is known about the foetuses and the women who had the abortions (Wadman 2020a) .",

            "text": "Both types of vaccines raise ethical issues around most appropriate vaccination policies, for example, about which groups to target first (Giubilini, Savulescu, Wilkinson 2020) and what level of coercion, if any, there should be (e.g. mandatory vaccination or some other measure). One ethical concern has been raised by representatives of certain religious groups who do not wish to receive COVID-19 vaccines that are linked to abortions (Wadman 2020b) . The Catholic Archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher, for instance, wrote that \"those who are troubled by [the COVID-19 vaccine] will either have to acquiesce to the social pressure to use the vaccine on themselves and their dependents, or conscientiously object to it\" (Fisher 2020) . Some of those who have previously defended a right to conscientious objection to vaccination in the name of religious freedom or freedom of conscience (e.g. Navin and Largent 2017) have applied their arguments to the future COVID-19 vaccines (Navin and Redinger 2020) . According to these views, individual freedom, including religious freedom, should be guaranteed as long as it does not pose significant threats to the collective. Unlike some other vaccines, in the case of COVID-19 there are alternatives to a vaccine that uses fetal cell lines at the development stageat the moment, in many countries, these alternatives are the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines. While these vaccines have not been developed with the use of fetal cell lines, they have used those fetal cell lines at the testing phase. However, the connection with abortion is more remote than in the case of vaccines that use fetal cell lines at the development stage.",

The estimate is that, after 90 days from the second dose, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 78 per cent effective at preventing high viral loads from the Delta variant (Powels et al. 2021) Importantly, these vaccines have shown high effectiveness on old age groups. Thus, many countries are distributing them according to a largely age-based priority order (adjusted to include some frontline workers among the high priority groups) to ensure that the most vulnerable will be the first to be immunized. This applied to the first dose of the vaccine and now applies to the third so-called \"booster dose,\" which some consider necessary in light of the quickly waning immunity conferred by the first two doses. The Oxford/Astra-Zeneca also proved to be very safe but showed lower effectiveness, though with mixed results. Clinical trials showed around 70 per cent effectiveness across all age groups but with some interesting variation on the basis of dosage, with 90 per cent effectiveness if administered through a half dose followed by a full dose and 62 per cent effectiveness if administered through two full doses. It is unclear at the moment whether the more effective dosage would work equally well across different age groups, as it was only observed in a group younger than 55 (Ramasamy et al. 2020; Voysey 2020; Knoll and Wonodi 2021) . Against the Delta variant, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is estimated to be 61 per cent effective against high viral load (Pouwels et al. 2021 )-that is against severely symptomatic cases that are more likely to result in hospitalizations and deaths. Clinical trials suggest that the Johnson&Johnson vaccine is 66 per cent effective at preventing symptomatic infections. Like the Oxford/AstraZeneca, the Johnson&Johnson vaccine has very high effectiveness at preventing severe cases and hospitalizations (FDA 2021).",

            "text": "Indeed, one important difference between vaccines is in their cost. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are quite expensive (\u00a329.26 for the two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech one, and \u00a337.5 \u2212 \u00a355.52 for the two doses of the Moderna one), and their distribution is made difficult by the fact that they need to be stored at very low temperatures (-70C for the Pfizer one, and -20C for the Moderna one, though after thawing the Moderna one can be preserved at normal fridge temperature for thirty days) (Brown 2020)-although some countries are enhancing their storage and distribution capacities 2 . In a country like the United Kingdom, this means that GP practices and pharmacies, where vaccinations are normally administered, have limited capacity to store and provide these vaccines. Both aspects would make it very difficult and often practically impossible to use such vaccines in low-income countries or to rely completely on them even in high-income countries. Even if it is true that countries like Israel or the United States have successfully mass-vaccinated using the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, many countries would either not be able to afford such costs or, quite reasonably, prefer to rely significantly on less expensive vaccines for mass vaccination. This will be even more likely given that Pfizer is now increasing the cost of its vaccine significantly, to US $23 per dose in the new contracts being signed with the European Union (Reuters 2021) . When it comes to mass vaccination, many countries-especially low and middle income ones-will want or need to rely to a significant extent on cheaper and easier to distribute vaccines such as the Oxford/AstraZeneca one, the Johnson&Johnson one, or any future vaccine that shares their features. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine does not need very low storage temperature and, very importantly, is much cheaper (approximately \u00a34.50 if the vaccine is used with the half/full dose regime). The same could be said for Johnson&Johnson's vaccine, which costs around US $10 per dose, but that only requires one dose, making it not only economically but also practically more feasible. These cheaper vaccines might well be the only way out of the emergency for lowand middle-income countries and an essential part of the way out for high-income countries as well.",

Vaccination strategies will need to take these advantages into account. For example, when it comes to mass vaccination in the long term, especially if vaccines will be required on a regular basis to prevent immunity from waning, a country might be able to offer the cheap Oxford/AstraZeneca or Johnson&Johnson vaccine completely free of charge but only partially subsidize for certain groups an expensive vaccine like the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna ones.

It might lead to negative publicity around vaccination and risk worse overall public health. If our worry is that giving a suboptimal vaccine might compromise public health strategies, surely a suboptimal vaccine is still better than no vaccine at all. This consideration is more relevant in a context where vaccination is not mandatory, and therefore vaccine refusal may lead to a failure to achieve adequate levels of collective immunity. (Whether vaccine mandates would instead be effective is beyond the scope of this article). This is a reasonable concern. However, we also need to consider the possibility, raised in the previous section, that providing choice of vaccine will undermine strategies of vaccine distribution. If we make the choice available to anyone irrespective of their moral or religious views (and there is a restricted supply of vaccines), then this risk is real. Thus, vaccination strategies could be compromised either way. We should not simply assume that a higher collective uptake with a large proportion of suboptimal individual vaccinations would be better than a lower collective uptake where all those who do get vaccinated receive the best vaccine for them.",

If we can do that, surely, we should, as we would achieve the same collective benefit with less liberty infringements. This might be a better way of balancing fairness, collective good, and individual freedom. However, we would need to consider whether the mechanism used to identify those allowed to object is in itself fair. For instance, a first come/first served basis for granting free choice of the vaccine is unlikely to be a fair system. Those who come first are likely to be either those who have priority access to the vaccine or easier access to healthcare services. The fairer system might be a lottery among all those who will be vaccinated in the short and long term and who would want the free choice. A lottery might be quite difficult to implement and to consistently keep in place over time. It is also worth mentioning that it is not a solution normally adopted in other contexts where a small number of outliers would not \"make a difference.\" For instance, we do not have a lottery to allow a small number of individuals to decide what their taxes should and should not fund, even if we can certainly afford a certain number of such individuals. This suggests that either a lottery solution is not very easily implementable or that we think that it would still be unfair towards those who do make their fair contribution. One possibility is that the unfairness in question lies not so much in the procedure to determine whom to exempt but in the idea that we should have exemptions in the first place.",

There is also a strong ethical requirement to make the distribution cost-effective, at least as long as availability is limited (but probably also after this phase). These requirements imply that vaccination strategies should be guided primarily by considerations around public health and effective use of limited resources. Different vaccines' characteristics might require that different vaccines be distributed in different ways and to different groups in the pursuit of such goals. Whether vaccines have been obtained with the use of aborted foetuses is not a consideration that is relevant to the pursuit of such strategies, and protecting religious freedom is not a priority of public health interventions (to say that it is not a \"priority\" does not mean that it is not important).",
