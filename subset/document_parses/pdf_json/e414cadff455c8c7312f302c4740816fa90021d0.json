            "text": "The current study examined anxiety and distress among members of the first community to be quarantined in the USA due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to being historically significant, the current sample was unusual in that those quarantined were all members of a Modern Orthodox Jewish community and were connected via religious institutions at which exposure may have occurred. We sought to explore the community and religious factors unique to this sample, as they relate to the psychological and public health impact of quarantine. Community organizations were trusted more than any other source of COVID-19-related information, including federal, state and other government agencies, including the CDC, WHO and media news sources. This was supported qualitatively with open-ended responses in which participants described the range of supports organized by community organizations. These included tangible needs (i.e., food delivery), social support, virtual religious services, and dissemination of COVID-19-related information. The overall levels of distress and anxiety were elevated and directly associated with what was reported to be largely inadequate and inconsistent health-related information received from local departments of health. In addition, the majority of participants felt that perception of or concern about future stigma related to a COVID-19 diagnosis or association of COVID-19 with the Jewish community was high and also significantly predicted distress and anxiety. The current study demonstrates the ways in which religious institutions can play a vital role in promoting the well-being of their constituents. During this unprecedented pandemic, public health authorities have an opportunity to form partnerships with religious institutions in the common interests of promoting health, relaying accurate information and supporting the psychosocial needs of community members, as well as protecting communities against stigma and discrimination.",

            "text": "In early March, the novel coronavirus remained a distant threat to most Americans. Despite pockets of outbreak in Seattle, confirmed cases in California, and mounting cases throughout Europe, most people in the United States felt that the possibility of infection was remote. On March 2, the first community-acquired case of COVID-19 was confirmed in New York State. A resident of lower Westchester county, the identification of \"Patient-one\" was a historic and life-altering event for many. Quickly following the diagnosis, the first large-scale quarantine order in the USA in over a century was ordered and included anyone who may have been in contact with Patient-one or his family members. What resulted was the quarantine of portions of lower Westchester county and the Northwest Bronx. While not geographically adjacent, these areas in fact represented a tight-knit community connected through religious and educational institutions. Patient-one is a member of the Modern Orthodox Jewish community, and quarantine directives were ordered for anyone that attended services or life-cycle events at the individual's synagogue the previous weekend. In addition, all students, staff and faculty at the school attended by the individual's children, a large Modern Orthodox day school in the New York City serving communities in the Bronx, Westchester, Manhattan and lower Connecticut, were also quarantined. The result was the isolation of virtually an entire community ranging from toddlers to adults connected via their adherence to a particular religious tradition and affiliation with the institutions associated with it. In addition, it emerged that Jews, and specifically the Orthodox community in New York, was one of the first and most heavily impacted communities in the COVID-19 crisis due to its emphasis on the centrality of communal religious life.",

            "text": "It has become evident over the course of the COVID-19 crisis that surprisingly little is known about the psychological impacts of quarantine. Studies from previous epidemics have relied on retrospective recall post-quarantine (Brooks et al. 2020; Hawryluck et al. 2004; Mazumder et al. 2020) . Research from the SARS (Gardner and Moallef 2015; Hawryluck et al. 2004) , Ebola (Drazen et al. 2014) and MERS (Jeong et al. 2016 ) epidemics have found elevated levels of distress, anxiety and depression both immediately following and months after quarantine had ended. The current study is among the first to approach the psychological impact of quarantine while individuals are actively under a quarantine directive. We sought to sample members of this first community to be quarantined in the USA to assess levels of distress and anxiety and to understand psychosocial factors specific to this community. We previously reported (Rosen et al. 2020 ) that levels of both anxiety and distress were elevated in this sample, and we examined situational and behavioral factors predictive of anxiety. In addition to situational factors such as length of time in quarantine and family composition, we found that behavioral factors including excess time engaged with COVID-19-related media and poor sleep quality were directly related to increased distress.",

We propose that a variety of factors unique to the religious nature of the community and associated institutions have the potential to mitigate or exacerbate levels of observed distress and anxiety. Specifically, we explore the ways in which this community, as both the first one in the USA with known widespread transmission and one with a highly visible religious identity, experiences stigma in relation to COVID-19 and the extent to which that impacts distress/anxiety. Feeling stigmatized could be a result of a variety of factors. In the early days of the pandemic in New York City, simply receiving a diagnosis of COVID-19 was likely perceived as stigmatizing as the extent of infection was not yet apparent. Additionally, since at that time it appeared that the infection was spreading through this one particular religious community, it likely enhanced feelings of stigmatization on a community and/or individual level.",

Previous research has recognized the importance of religious institutions, and specifically the role of religious leaders, in promoting health and communicating health messages through credibility in their communal positions and knowledge of their constituents (Anshel and Smith 2014; Taylor et al. 2019) . To our knowledge, however, this type of dissemination has not been directly compared to messages delivered through public health authorities and has certainly not been examined in the midst of a global pandemic.",

Responses included \"Extensive volunteer system for delivering food,\" \"WhatsApp groups for food delivery and other errands,\" \"Synagogue offers young members [that are not quarantined] to deliver food to older or susceptible individuals\" and \"People can sign up to request certain needs and others will sign up to fill those needs.\" (b) Social support 25% of responses referenced the ways in which the community organizations have provided virtual means of social support. Notably, this also included a subset of responses that specifically referred to ensuring the wellbeing of elderly constituents. Responses included \"support Zoom meetings, calling elderly to check in on them,\" \"Synagogue and school Zoom meetings to help relieve stress and allow for social interactions. The community is trying to keep us connected and as busy as possible which has been a huge help!,\" \"Synagogue volunteer outreach to seniors in the community\" and \"FaceTime classes to raise spirits.\" (c) Informational support 18.75% of responses focused on the importance of their community organizations helping them stay informed during quarantine. Responses included \"Our synagogue has been amazing at organizing information calls and hotlines\" and \"The school has been amazing at keeping us informed every step of the way.\" (d) Religious and other communal supports 12.5% of responses referred to virtual opportunities to remain engaged in religious communal life and included \"many zoom support, prayer and study groups,\" \"remote participation in shul (synagogue) classes, prayers and events\" and \"my synagogue is doing an outstanding job with community engagement in the time of corona.\"",

This community was quarantined prior to when widespread stay-at-home orders were issued and were among the first, and still one of the only communities, to have their movements totally restricted. As a community bound together by their religious beliefs and quarantined due to their affiliations with Jewish community organizations at which they could have been exposed to COVID-19, we sought to explore the ways in which this identity impacted individuals' experiences. Specifically, we examined the ways in which religious institutions and their leaders responded to the community's needs by mobilizing support services ranging from the tangible (i.e., delivering food to those quarantined, providing information and updates about the crisis), to the spiritual (i.e., organizing virtual religious services), and how this impacted distress and anxiety.",

Before widespread community transmission of COVID-19 was recognized, shelter-in-place and quarantine measures were not yet the norm, and there were widespread inconsistencies, even between state and city agencies, about who should be quarantined and what the parameters for quarantine should be. The lack of coordination and inconsistencies in messaging from different authorities were both a source of distress and driver of anxiety. As we observed, only 20% of the current sample found the information they received from local agencies to be adequate, while more than half (60%) reported that they found the clarity of information either completely inadequate or with significant gaps. Participants who perceived the messages to be inadequate also reported higher levels of distress. It is on this front that local religious and community institutions appear to have filled the gap normally held by government bodies such as the CDC or the local Department of Healthand provided trusted information to their constituents including public health information. As shown in Fig. 3 , more participants reported that they completely trusted information provided by their local community institutions than from any other information source. Open-ended responses support this observation with comments consistently referring to the clarity of communications from local religious leaders and their institutions.",

However, participants reported that the ability to participate in religious life remotely via communal prayer groups, study groups and life-cycle events was an important part of managing their quarantine. Future studies should examine how well-established factors relating to religion, spirituality and health, prayer, attachment to God and intrinsic religious orientation are related to managing the ongoing psychological and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, spiritually centered clinical interventions may be appropriate when applied on an individual level (Rosmarin 2018) as people begin to grapple with the existential nature of the unfolding pandemic.",

It is therefore not surprising that religious identity was at the forefront when reporting on experiences of stigma. Over half of the sample (50.3%) reported either anticipating stigma or actually experiencing stigma due to the association of their religious community with the pandemic. Further, the extent to which they felt stigmatized on either an individual or community level was associated with their reported levels of anxiety and distress. Openended responses suggested that while many individuals were concerned with general COVID-19-related stigma, most were concerned with potential negative repercussions for the Jewish community at large. Specifically, there was concern about the perception that Jews, and specifically Orthodox Jews, were to blame for spreading COVID-19 in New York. This perception was valid, considering that it appears similar to the high levels of anti-Chinese sentiment that began to percolate around New York City and other parts of the USA in the early stages of the pandemic (He et al. 2020 ). Indeed, a recent report (Schwartz 2020) recorded an increase in worldwide anti-Semitism since the start of the pandemic consistent with historically anti-Semitic tropes related to Jews and other minorities as being \"unclean\" and spreading infection. In fact, recent empirical research suggests that this perception about minority groups often persists despite evidence suggesting a greater emphasis on cleanliness among many religious individuals (Litman et al. 2019 ).",

The instrumental role that religious leaders can play in public health efforts has been well documented (Taylor et al. 2019) , and public health partnerships between religious leaders and health care have been used in a variety of health promotions programs to varying degrees of success (Darnell et al. 2006; Miller 2018; Welch and Hughes 2020) . Religious organizations should be viewed as valuable community partners in disseminating and supporting public health messaging. This is perhaps most important in traditionally underserved communities and those with unequal access to health care. In addition, as misinformation regarding COVID-19 and myriad other health-related issues abound, religious leaders have an opportunity and responsibility to provide scientifically informed health education. Future research should examine the best ways to form partnerships between religious institutions and leaders and public health officials in order to create systems that can communicate clearly in fast-moving situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Religious institutions can play a vital role in supporting individuals' psychological needs by providing social support, and promoting feelings of unity within the context of each institution's religious and spiritual framework. This may be especially effective during the COVID-19 pandemic as the multitude of medical, social and economic issues created by this crisis call for a coordinated response from institutions ranging from government to health care to religious institutions. During this unprecedented time as we face a crisis that has the potential to undermine much of our societal infrastructure, religious institutions and their leaders will have an even greater role to play in managing the social and psychological as well as public health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
