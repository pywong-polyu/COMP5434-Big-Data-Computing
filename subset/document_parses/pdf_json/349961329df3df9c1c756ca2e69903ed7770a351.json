Methods This epidemiological cross-sectional study was conducted with middle-school students in Denizli. A questionnaire consisting of the IES-R, CRIES-13 and a sociodemographic data form was delivered online. A total of 1059 participants who fully completed the questionnaire were included for analysis. Results The IES-R total and subdimension scores and the CRIES-13 scores were found to be significantly higher in families with an income level of \u22642,500 TL. The CRIES-13 scores of children were found to be significantly higher in divorced families. No statistically significant difference was determined between the IES-R total and subdimension scores of the parents who were healthcare workers and the CRIES-13 scale scores of their children. Conclusion A statistically significant, positive, moderate relationship was found between the IES-R scale total and subdimension scores of parents and the CRIES-13 scale scores of children. A low socioeconomic level was seen to increase the prevalence of anxiety in adults and adolescents. The children of divorced families were found to be at higher risk of PTSD. Successful management of mental health symptoms in parents will reflect positively on the mental health status of their children.",

            "text": "Since December 2019, the social interaction and mobility of millions of people have been severely restricted because of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 1 To be able to control the spread of the pandemic in Turkey, schools, universities, parks, theaters and cinemas, restaurants, etc., have been closed since the end of March 2020 and restrictions have also been imposed in other areas. The COVID-19 pandemic has had numerous negative effects on the lives of children, such as acute-chronic stress, anxiety about the family, unexpected and sudden losses, inability to attend school, increased internet and social media use, and anxiety about the economic future of their families and their country. 2 cial interactions have been disrupted because of school closures and curfews. While supporting remote education for children, parents have been working from home, with no access to other systems for support in the care and education of children (broader family, courses, etc.). In addition to these concerns, many people in all countries have lost their jobs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created further economic problems. This issue has had a significant effect on children, adolescents and the whole family, and negative effects have been seen on mental health. 3 It is known that children show various stress reactions when they face unexpected and unknown events, and so it would wrong to think they are not affected by the trauma and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there are studies concerning the reactions of children to traumatic events, very few studies have examined how epidemics affect children. 4 Since COVID-19 is a recent pandemic, studies related to its effect on mental health are limited and our knowledge of the effects of pandemics on mental health are based on studies conducted during epidemics caused by other infections. Studies which were conducted during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic showed an increase in stress and the frequency of diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in individuals. 5 In studies which have examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children, social isolation and restrictions have been seen to affect adolescents, and symptoms of anxiety have increased. [6] [7] [8] A study in the Republic of Ireland reported an increase in feelings of social isolation, depression, anxiety, and inappropriate behaviour in children because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 9 Another study in China found the most commonly seen mental health symptoms in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic to be attention problems, behavioural disorders, irritability, and fears related to infection transmission. 10 A study in Turkey showed that the mental health of children was negatively affected by separation from their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. 11 In the light of this information, it is predicted that pandemic may have traumatic effects on children and their parents and this effect may increase the mutual traumatic impact between the child and the parent, besides traumatic effects on the parent and the child may be higher if the parent is a healthcare worker. It was thought that a high socioeconomic level of the family would reduce the traumatic impact, while a low socioeconomic level could increase the traumatic effect.",

The necessary permission was obtained from the Ministry of Health, Scientific Research Studies Commission, Pamukkale University Faculty of Medicine, Non-Interventional Clinical Studies Ethics Committee (09.06.2020/11) and the Provincial Directorate of National Education. The sampling calculation for the schools and students in schools was made using the sampling formula with the known universe. The universe contained 111 schools and 40,835 students and the rate of incidence was deemed to be 50%. When the calculation was made considering the deviation margin for determination of the number of schools as d=0.3 and number of students as d=0.05, it was calculated that 381 students from 11 schools had to be included in the study. A total of 11 secondary schools were selected at random from 38 public secondary schools in Pamukkale county, 44 public secondary schools in Merkezefendi county, and 29 private secondary schools. A random selection was made to include 4 schools from Pamukkale county, 5 from Merkezefendi county and 2 private schools. The total number of students in these randomly determined schools was 5,170, and it was aimed to reach the families of students, to conduct the study with all the students and their families, who met the eligibility criteria and who were willing to participate in the study and provide feedback. An online questionnaire consisting of 54 questions was delivered, consisting of the Impact of Events Scale-Revised form (IES-R) validated in Turkish, to be completed by parents, the Child Revised Impact of Events Scale-13 (CRIES-13), and a sociodemographic data form prepared by the researchers. All parents and students, who agreed to participate in study, were included with no exclusion criteria. A total of 1,107 students, aged 10 to 15 years agreed to participate in the study together with their parents, and the questionnaire was fully completed by 1,059 participants.",

The scale assesses the aspects of traumatic stress syndrome, as avoidance, hyperstimulation and re-experience. The level of experience of symptoms in the last week is assessed using a Likert response of 0-4 (none-very much) with total scores ranging between 0 and 88. Higher points indicate a higher level of traumatic stress. 12 Turkish adaptation of the scale was made by Corapcioglu et al. 13 In a study of 104 subjects diagnosed with PTDS and 65 subjects without PTSD, the internal consistency of the test was calculated as 0.94, and when the cutoff value of the scale was between 24-33, sensitivity was found to be 74.0-92.2% and specificity, 70.7-81.0%. The total IES-R score is evaluated as an indicator of normal (0-23), mild (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) , moderate (33) (34) (35) (36) or severe (\u226537) psychological effect.",

The mean IES-R score of nonhealthcare worker parents was 29.92 and the mean IES-R score of healthcare worker parents was 31.49. These results are consistent with other studies, conducted in Italy and Wuhan-China. 1, 17, 18 No statistically significant difference was determined between the IES-R total and subdimension scores of healthcare worker parents and non-healthcare worker parents and the CRIES-13 scale scores of their respective children. This result did not support our hypothesis. No statistically significant difference was determined between the IES-R total and subdimension scores of healthcare worker parents who worked actively in COVID-19 wards and clinics and those of parents who were not working actively in COVID-19 wards and clinics and the CRIES-13 scale scores of their respective children. In another study, it was determined that healthcare workers had higher scores in IES-R compared to non-healthcare workers, and this difference was caused by the healthcare workers working actively with COVID-19 patients. 1 In the current study, although the scores of healthcare workers were not statistically significant, they were higher than the scores of non-healthcare worker parents. However, no difference was seen between parents who were healthcare workers and worked in COV-ID-19 wards and clinics and those who did not, and their respective children. This may be explained by the fact that only 7.5% of the participants were healthcare workers and 1.4% were active healthcare workers in COVID-19 wards and clinics, and therefore the sample was small. The high IES-R points of healthcare workers may be attributed to the healthcare workers working under risk during the pandemic. However, while the non-healthcare worker parents were at less risk in respect of exposure to COVID-19, in addition to the quarantine measures, they might have been affected by social stress, such as closure of workplaces, isolation, etc. In a study conducted in Singapore during the SARS epidemic, it was reported that 17.7% of healthcare workers displayed psychiatric symptoms. In that study, the cutoff point of the IES scale was accepted as 26 points. 19 In another study, 17.3% of healthcare workers reported symptoms and in a 1-year follow-up, this rate was reported as 15.4%. 20 Other studies related to the COVID-19 pandemic, 1, 17, 18 have provided higher scores. The global nature of the pandemic, and the effect of cultural differences on emotional symptoms, might have caused this difference.",

In literature, it has been reported that mood and anxiety disorders, and in some stud-ies, post-traumatic stress disorder, were seen more frequently in women compared to men both among healthcare workers and in the general population. 17, 21 The parent IES-R total and subdimension scores were found to be statistically significantly lower in families with an income of \u226510,000 TL. The parent IES-R total and subdimension scores were found to be statistically significantly higher in families with an income of \u22642,500 TL. The CRIES-13 scores in families with an income of \u22642,500 TL were found to be significantly higher. This result supported our hypothesis. A low socioeconomic level is known to increase the incidence of anxiety and depression in adults. [22] [23] [24] In a study, it was seen that 96 % of young people in families of a lower socioeconomic level had anxiety and depression and they were mentally more fragile. Factors such as the divorce of parents and parental psychopathology affect the mental health of young people, yet the study results showed the greatest correlation to be with parental income. 25 Although it is known that socioeconomic factors affect depression and anxiety symptoms in young people, the current study is one of the few studies to have demonstrated that such socioeconomic inequalities are related to anxiety in children and adolescents. [25] [26] [27] [28] The CRIES-13 scores were found to be significantly higher for the children in divorced families. A divorce is a life event that creates socioeconomic changes and to which children can have difficulty adapting. 29 Children who have been subjected to chronic stress and traumatic experiences in infancy and childhood are known to be mentally more fragile. 30 A previous study reported that the children of families with divorced parents and ongoing conflicts between parents, had more frequent PTSD symptoms. 31 It has been found that in children of divorced families, sensitivity to anxiety was higher, 32 and higher anxiety sensitivity increased susceptibility to mental disorders, such as panic disorder, agoraphobia, PTSD, major depressive disorder, social anxiety and substance abuse. [33] [34] [35] In the current study, in line with literature, it was determined that children of divorced families were at higher risk of developing PTSD. Although there are studies in literature concerning the reactions of children to traumatic events, there are very few studies which have examined how epidemics affect children. 4 In many studies, it has been reported that due to negative life events and stress, symptoms such as anxiety, depression, lethargy, disturbed social interaction, and loss of appetite, are seen in children. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] Children who have become distant from their social circles and their friends with the closure of schools, experience a significantly restricted social life, and with the decrease in activities, not only become isolated at home and may become increasingly anxious about contracting infection. In this context, the role of parents in the alleviation of the psychological effects of isolation, is very important.",
