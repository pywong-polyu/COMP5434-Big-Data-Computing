This paper seeks to contribute to the discussion by (1) assessing spending patterns to identify areas for savings; (2) evaluating the pension system; (3) analyzing the scope for revenue rebalancing; and (4) putting forward a package of spending cuts and tax rebalancing that is growth friendly and inclusive, could have limited near-term output costs, and would achieve a notable reduction in public debt over the medium term. Such a package could help the authorities balance the need to bring down public debt and, thus, reduce vulnerabilities while supporting the economic recovery.",

Italy has run primary fiscal surpluses that on average were higher than its euro area peers, but these were insufficient to lower debt and secure stability.

Firstly, it discusses public spending trends and composition. An analysis of spending over the past two decades reveals that: (1) in the decade following euro accession, spending grew faster than potential output, owing in large part to the rapid growth of pensions; (2) since the global financial crisis, spending has been broadly controlled, mainly through a freeze on hiring and wages and cuts in capital spending. Pension spending though has continued to rise; (3) despite the recent spending control, the pre-crisis spending excesses have not been reversed; and (4) achieving sizable and durable expenditure savings may require lowering the large pension spending. Improving the efficiency of health spending in some geographical areas could also lead to some savings.",

At around 16% of GDP, pension spending in Italy is the second highest in the euro area after Greece. The Italian authorities have legislated several reforms in the past. However, before the full effect of these reforms is evident over the very long run, fiscal pressures are likely to persist and weigh on Italy's goal of achieving and maintaining a balanced budget. The second part of this paper finds that: (1) despite past reforms, there remain generous parts of the system where Italy is an outlier, pointing to areas of potential savings; and (2) pension projections rest on optimistic assumptions of (a) employment, specifically that Italy will go from having among the highest to very low unemployment rates; and (b) Italy will maintain much higher real GDP growth rates for decades to come than has been its experience and policy settings. Relaxing these assumptions implies a notable rise in projected spending over the coming decades until the full benefits of past reforms become evident.",

From 1999 to 2007, Italy's nominal current primary expenditure grew faster than the euro area average, and well above the country's average nominal potential growth-driven mainly by social benefit spending (primarily pensions), intermediate consumption (goods and services), and wages (in general services, defense and health). Capital spending rose in line with that of the euro area average. From 2008 to 2016, however, Italy's nominal current primary expenditure grew at 1.8% per year on average, below the euro area average of 2.6%. 1 The deceleration after the global financial crisis was driven mainly by the decline in the public sector wage bill-reflecting the freezing of nominal wages from 2010 to 2015 and a reduction in the number of public sector employees from 3.6 million in 2007 to around 3.3 million people in 2015; and a severe cut in capital expenditure, which declined by about 28% in nominal terms between 2009 and 2016. Nevertheless, even with these exceptional measures, total primary spending grew above the country's average nominal potential GDP growth over this period. Italy has been unable to reverse its past overspending (especially those related to the pre-crisis period). 1 The high cost of servicing public debt implies total public expenditure in Italy about 2% of GDP above the euro area average (at 50.4% of GDP versus 48.5%). Interest on debt (4.2% of GDP in 2015) absorbs more resources than spending on education (4% of GDP), and is over 3\u00bd times as much as on defense (1.2% of GDP).",

It constitutes half of total primary spending, up from 40% at the time of euro accession. The bulk of social benefits spending is in pensions (see Sect. 3), reflecting both a high share of elderly population and generous pension benefits. However, non-pension social benefit spending in Italy is low, fragmented, and poorly targeted in comparison to other EU countries. The latter is evidenced in the disproportionately low share of social transfers accruing to the low-income working age population. There is also a higher reliance on intra-family transfers for social assistance, even as there is underspending related to social inclusion, family/child benefits, and housing relative to the euro area average.",

(2) Other areas of overspending include intermediate consumption spending (primarily on goods and services) in the health sector; compensation of employees in defense, public order and safety, and health; subsidies in the economic affairs sector; and capital transfers in general services and economic affairs. (3) It is notable that although overall public health spending in Italy is in line with the euro area average, the bulk of it is for compensation of employees and intermediate consumption, in contrast with the euro area average where the share of spending on these two items is significantly lower and that of expenditure on provision of other social benefits is 50% higher. This points to room for potential efficiency savings, especially in some regions. 2 Medeiros and Schwierz (2015) Table 1 Italy and Euro Area: general government spending, 2005-2014, and 2015 highlight regional differences and show that the output of public spending is lower in southern regions based on health-related variables, such as life expectancy at the age of 65. (4) The main areas where Italy underspends is in education (i.e., in the provision of goods and services and in total compensation). The public education expenditure gap is especially concentrated at the tertiary level, as highlighted in OECD (2015a, b) . As for economic classification, underspending is largely in gross capital formation (Fig. 1) .",

There is a need for public investment to support stronger, sustained growth. 3 Moreover, as a share of total employment, public sector employment is below the euro area average; the age structure of public employees is titled toward older workers, implying the need to refresh the skill mix without reducing the headcount further (there have been recent announcements for hiring sizable numbers of new staff, in education and local offices); and, after years of wage freezes, wage increases are planned. 4 This suggests limited room, if any, for further cuts in the overall wage bill or in capital spending, going forward, and thus for little alternative but to tackle the sizable social benefits spending (Fig. 2) .

Both statutory and early retirement ages are set to increase further over time as part of the 'Fornero' reform (L. 214/2011). 5 Currently, the Statutory Retirement Age (SRA) is 66 years and 7 months. Early Retirement is allowed regardless of age based on minimum years of service of 42-43 years. Under NDC, workers may retire up to 3 years earlier than the SRA with minimum 20 years of contributions and a pension of at least \u20ac1200 per month. From 2013 onwards, the eligibility requirements are linked to changes in life expectancy at 65 (every 3 years up to 2019 and 2 years starting from 2021). Occasionally, pathways to early retirements were eased or implementation of stricter rules were postponed (e.g., the 2017 and 2019 budgets). The experimental \"Quota 100\" early retirement rule, introduced in 2019, created a discontinuity in the retirement age that needs to be addressed. 6 In general, special treatments and incentives for early withdrawal from the labor market should be avoided in both DB and NDC schemes (see also IMF 2010). 5 Following the 'Fornero' reform, the pension system (1) adopts an actuarial computation of pension benefits using an implicit rate based on the accrued contributions, and automatically adjusted to mortality developments; and (2) introduces periodic increases in all eligibility requirements in line with longevity developments. 6 According to the Quota 100 rule, workers who are at least 62 years of age with a minimum 38 years of contributions are eligible for early retirement during 2019-21. Women who are at least 59 years of age with a minimum 35 years of contributions are also eligible.

An accrual rate of 2% is high by international comparison, compared to about 1.5-1.7% in the EU/euro area. (2) For insurance years before 1992, the reference wage is defined as the last monthly wage for civil servants or an average wage of the last 5-10 years in the private sector, based on different sources and occupations. For contribution years after 1992, the number of annual wages involved in the calculation increases gradually until it covers the last 10 years for employees and the last 15 years for the self-employed. But the periods over which pensionable earnings are calculated are still too short and tend to inflate the pension benefits of the DB scheme. On the other hand, the NDC (by definition) covers total lifetime contributions. Under the DB scheme, the early retirement penalty is 1% at the age of 61, 2% at the age of 60, and a further 2 p.p. for each year below 60. These penalties are rather lenient- Queisser and Whitehouse (2006) calculate that, for Italy, the actuarially neutral reduction in benefits for each year of early retirement is in the order of 7.5%.",

In a \"pure\" NDC, the IRR should be chosen to ensure actuarial balance between the system-wide assets and liabilities (\"Annex\"). In steady state, the IRR converges to the rate of economic growth. 9 While in the Italian NDC the IRR that credits the notional capital each period is the moving average of nominal GDP growth over the past 5 years, the discount rate used to derive the annuity factor, defined as the ratio of the IRR to a rate of inflation indexing, is set at a rate of 1.5%, based on an expected longrun real growth rate. 10 Absent comprehensive and decisive structural reforms, such a real rate of return is considerably above Italy's current growth potential. In the Italian pension system, the adjustment to macro-demographic conditions (such as the periodic revisions in the transformation coefficient) affect future generations of retirees only, leaving current retirees unaffected. The IRR that credits the notional capital is linked to past performance. It would therefore be important to introduce an automatic adjustment (or sustainability) factor that links current pension payments to a measure of a long-term actuarial balance to shield against unforeseen shocks and improve intergenerational equity (see Barr and Diamond, 2011 , for a discussion on such a \"break\" mechanism in Sweden).",

Secondly, over the next decade, until 2025, the benefit rate-the ratio of average pensions to GDP per worker-is expected to increase pension spending, owing to the generosity of the old though declining DB component compared to low productivity growth. Thereafter, the share of retirees under the NDC scheme is projected to become sufficiently large to dominate the more generous older DB scheme, settling the benefit rate on a modest downward trend. Thirdly, the strongest savings in the RGA's projections stem from a sizeable pick-up in the employment rate, with a notable increase in labor force participation and a substantial decrease in unemployment, as well as from reforms to restrict early retirement and extend retirement ages (eligibility rate)-reducing pension spending by about 2\u00bd and 6% of GDP over the long-run, respectively.

Such projections appear very optimistic. Lower TFP growth would lower GDP growth immediately but would impact pension benefits slowly-through wages that pass through to lower contributions and thus lower notional stock of pension capital. According to the RGA (2016), 0.25% points lower labor productivity growth would lead to about 0.5% of GDP higher pension spending in both 2040 and 2060, whereas 0.2% points lower TFP alone would increase the pension spending to GDP ratio by 0.6-0.7% of GDP, respectively. In response to a permanent negative labor productivity shock (of about \u00bd% points per year), our simulations suggest that pension spending would be about 1% of GDP higher in both 2040 and 2060 (red long dash lines in Fig. 3) . 15 The 2017 population projections by the United Nations Population Division point to more rapid aging in Italy compared to demographic projections with base year 2016 recently published by ISTAT, increasing the long-run pension spending further by about 1% of GDP at peak (red dotted lines in Fig. 3 ). The RGA (2017) also reports an additional set of pension projections based on the EC-EPC (AWG) 2018 assumptions (with a steady state unemployment rate of about 7\u00bd% as well as a faster achievement of 1% TFP growth by 2035). The result is an increase in pension spending by about 2% of GDP at peak (blue long dash lines in Fig. 3 ) when compared to the national scenario.",

An example is whether pension measures should apply to new retirees (i.e., on a flow basis) or to existing pensioners (i.e., impacting the stock). In some institutional settings pension measures can often be best implemented in a context of a coherent systemwide reform rather than in a piecemeal or ad hoc manner, affecting only certain categories of pensioners. It can also be easier-both from institutional and political perspectives-to implement pension reforms if they are based on well-established system-wide principles such as equalization of internal rates of return or actuarial fairness. For example, Kohli and Arza (2011) argue that reforms that involve stronger link between contributions and benefits may be more legitimate and easier to implement since, when compared to retrenchments or stand-alone parametric changes, these appeal to shared values and norms. Pension reforms should also be clearly justified and accompanied by socio-economic and legal assessments. Every effort should be done to clarify reform needs, that, inter alia, can involve improving system-wide equity or overall fiscal sustainability. this end are outlined below. These could go toward creating the room for achieving higher primary surpluses that Italy needs to put public debt on a firm downward trajectory as well as to improve intra-generational equity by shifting the adjustment on retirees who thus far have been relatively better off. Longer-term savings come from using more realistic (or conservative parameters) that guide long-term pension benefit calculations as well as ensuring actuarial balance.",

This option could be considered if future pension spending cannot be reduced by other means. There is also value in: (6) subjecting pension benefits to health contributions and realign the tax-free threshold with wage earners. Retirees should not be burdened with pension or unemployment contributions, although they are relatively more frequent consumers of health services and therefore should pay health contributions. Consideration should also be given to reversing the higher tax-free threshold for retirees introduced in the 2017 budget; and (7) adjusting the NDC discount factor to reflect realistic growth potential and introduce an automatic adjustment mechanism that links pension spending to the long-term actuarial balance (as, for example, done in Sweden, Canada, and Germany). The main purpose of such a mechanism is to allow for automatic adjustments in current pension payments as a response to permanent shocks, thus helping to keep the pension system solvent without a possible need to increase payroll taxes (that in turn would lead to increases in future benefits).

The labor cost for openended employees can be deducted from the IRAP tax base; there is a possibility for regions to reduce up to zero the tax rate of 3.9% or increase it by up to 0.9 pp. 20 The tax wedge is sum of taxes and SSCs paid by employees and SSCs paid by employers, minus family received benefits.

Italy has the lowest labor supply of married women among EU countries. This is in part driven by a tax credit for non-working spouses that discourages their labor supply. A better design is to replace this with a tax credit if both spouses are employed (called working family, or in-work, tax credit), which can be increasing with the number of children (as, e.g., in the UK and the US). Available evidence suggests that adopting in-work tax credits for low income earners, within a revenue-neutral reform, can have sizable impacts on the female labor-force participation and aggregate employment (Saez et al. 2002; De Mooij 2008) . For Italy, Colonna and Marcassa (2015) find that replacing the dependent-spouse tax credit with an in-work tax credit increases married women participation rate by 3% points. However, although in-work tax credit alleviates the tax burden at the extensive margin, there is a risk of increasing distortion at the intensive margin of labor supply, which can be mitigated through an appropriate design of the in-work credit.",

In 2015, recurrent taxes on immovable property raised 1.6% of GDP in Italy. Even if taxes on primary residence were reintroduced, to fully exploit the potential of the property tax, it is essential to reform the cadastral system and update the cadastral declared value of the property on the Rogito (deed of sale).

The VAT compliance gap as of 2015 was \u20ac35.1 billion, about 26% of total VAT liability (2.1% of GDP), significantly higher than the EU-27 average (12.8%). Halving this gap, while maintaining all tax rates unchanged, would increase revenues by 1.05% of GDP. Moreover, based on EU (2016), fully closing the policy gap, i.e., if no VAT reduced rates and exemptions were applied, would enable Italy to increase its VAT revenue by an additional 15%. This estimate, however, is based on a full compliance scenario. Adopting a lower number of reduced rates could be an intermediate step toward lowering this policy gap. Decreasing the range of items subjected to reduced rates or exemptions is also important for lowering the policy gap. For instance, instead of exempting taxi services from the VAT, they can be subject to the reduced rate; however, if taxis pay VAT on their inputs, a careful analysis is needed to assess the revenue impact. 27 Tax arrears are at an alarmingly high level reaching \u20ac614 billion (as of 2016). Toro et al. (2015) suggest that a significant amount of arrears is not collectable (e.g., because 31% of debtors are out of business or bankrupt and 36% relate to cases where enforcement actions were taken but did not result in actual collection) calling for effective write-off arrangements. Recurrent tax concessions undermine voluntary compliance culture and the effectiveness of tax administration. About \u20ac31 billion of tax arrears is deemed recoverable. Enforcement actions are critical that could be supported with timely filing, modern payment arrangements, and relaxing legal constraints.",

Two types of growth-friendly revenue and spending measures are considered along the envisaged fiscal consolidation path: shifting taxation from direct to indirect taxes, and lowering expenditure and shifting its composition from transfers to investment. On the revenue side, a lower labor tax wedge (1.5% of GDP) is offset by higher VAT collections from reduced policy and compliance gaps (1% of GDP) and introducing a modern property tax on primary residences (0.5% of GDP). 33 On the expenditure side, spending on public consumption is lowered by 1.25% of GDP, while productive public investment spending is increased by 0.5% of GDP. The remaining portion of the fiscal consolidation, 1.25% of GDP, is implemented via reduced social transfers. In the model-based analysis, it is assumed that higher public investment spending and an associated higher level of government capital exert positive spillovers on private sector productivity.

The increase in output is even larger in the long run (around 2\u00bd% higher than the baseline) while the debt-to-GDP ratio is more than 35% points lower than the baseline. For example, starting from 133% of GDP in 2018, debt-to-GDP ratio would decline to 98% in 10 years and GDP growth would be 0.2% points higher per year. The positive response of the economy is a result of a less distortionary new tax structure, with lower labor tax wedges, and of the more productive spending, namely on public investment, and lower debt-service costs (implementation of this package would bolster investor confidence). Lower taxes on capital induce firms to increase investment and raise their desired level for the private capital stock. Lower labor income taxes encourage households to provide more labor. The net effect of lower income taxes and higher lump-sum as well as value-added taxes is positive on private consumption in the long term. The revenue-neutral tax reform on its own-with no change in the debt-to-GDP ratio-would result in higher private consumption and output owing to the economy moving towards less distortionary sources of taxation.",

The productive public spending stimulates private capital accumulation and the lower deficit and debt ratios result in significant savings on debt-service costs. In the short run, before the benefits of more productive investment and of lower debt fully materialize, the reduced social transfers and public consumption dampen somewhat private consumption and output. Short-term costs though are quite modest and are traded for significant longer-term benefits of permanently higher private consumption and output. The fiscal consolidation/composition shift scenario assumes that the measures are gradually phased in over the period of 4 years (\u00bd of GDP per year). If the announcement of the reform is fully understood by firms and households and fully believed, the short-term costs are even smaller than in the case when the general public considers permanent only the measures implemented in the given year and in the past, but do not believe that future reforms will be implemented. When households and firms believe the whole path of fiscal reforms they invest more from the outset and reap the long-term benefits of the fiscal consolidation sooner. Overall, the high quality of fiscal adjustment enhances the confidence about debt sustainability, hence, lowering the interest costs and offsetting the contractionary impact of a moderately-gradual fiscal tightening (see Blanchard and other 2019 on contractionary fiscal expansions in Italy). This contrasts with the Italian experience during the European debt crisis 34 for three reasons: (1) the assumed adjustment in our simulations is more gradual; (2) the quality of fiscal adjustment is improved; (3) and fiscal multipliers are likely smaller because the output gap is narrower, and the public debt is higher.",

We showed that a comprehensive fiscal reform package predicated on a revenue-neutral and less distortionary tax reform, alongside current spending cuts and capital spending increases, can generate sizable output gains and a sustainably lower public debt ratio over the medium to long term. Short-term output costs of this fiscal package, if implemented credibly, are likely limited.",

This is not to say that the DB system cannot cope with such shocks; this could be achieved by linking the formulae or retirement ages to life expectancy for example. Discretionary adjustments differ in terms of parameters that policy makers can control. Examples of these in the NDC are IRR computation rules, minimum retirement age, life expectancy tables, and methods to calculate annuity. In the DB scheme, many such parameters are absent or non-discretionary; instead, policy-makers can control, inter alia, accrual rates or the way pensionable earnings are calculated.",
