Therefore, doctor B was the most possible source of SARS-CoV-2 in the health-care workers attended the MDT. The possibility that some health-care workers in the same department as doctor B may be infected by doctor B during daily work cannot be precluded. It was reported that asymptomatic persons are potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection [3] . The MDT was hold 3 days before symptoms onset of doctor B. Doctor B was in incubation period when attended the MDT. Whereas, doctor B was yet induced transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to 16 health-care workers. Thus, a person infected SARS-CoV-2 may be a 'super-spreader' even during incubation period. Indeed, the presence of 'superspreaders' of COVID-19 cannot be precluded in the large clinical research of Dr. Zhong's group [4] . Phenomenon of super-spreading was observed in SARS and MERS [5] . In addition, the third and fourth generation of COVID-19 was detected in this case, which indicated possible sustained human-to-human transmission of COVID-19.",
