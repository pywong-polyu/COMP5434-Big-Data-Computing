The sample of the study consists of 1260 people selected according to the convenience sampling method. Social distancing phobia scale, generalized anxiety disorder, perceived stress scale, and positive negative emotion scale were used in the study. As a result of the analysis, this scale consists of 17 items with three factors including \"physiological, emotional, and behavioral response.\" With its psychometric properties in assessing the three-sub-dimensional construct of the social distancing phobia scale, this scale will help to provide a better understanding of the emotions and psychological or psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, generalized anxiety disorder was found to significantly predict perceived stress and social distancing phobia.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 virus, which emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, affected people around the world. In addition, due to the very high infection rate of COVID-19, individuals should continue to follow three basic rules: mask, social distance, and hygiene (Gabutti et al., 2020; Shahbaz et al., 2020) . Social distance is one of the concepts that emerged with the pandemic. Especially due to the asymptomatic nature of the pandemic, social distance may cause the individuals to make excessive efforts to protect themselves and to develop fear of the virus (Fernandez et al., 2020) . This fear can reach the maximum level when individuals go out. Individuals may even experience an extreme and unrealistic fear of not being able to maintain social distance with other people in social life (\u00dcst\u00fcn & \u00d6z\u00e7ift\u00e7i, 2020) . For this reason, excessive effort to be protected from the virus can be effective in the emergence of unrealistic fears in some individuals (Duan & Zhu, 2020) . Thus, phobia reveals avoidance behaviors in the person and significantly affects their life and restricts the people socially (Wu et al., 2009) . So the social distance is the most important rule among these three rules because individuals are responsible for using a mask and paying attention to hygiene rules. However, the social distancing rule is not a rule that individuals can achieve only by obeying alone. Social distancing is a rule that other people must follow in social life (Canatan, 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Finkelstein et al., 2010 During the COVID-19 pandemic era, it was found that the epidemic had serious negative effects (stress, anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms, and obsessive behaviors) on the mental health of the individual (Cai et al., 2020; Duan & Zhu, 2020; Fardin, 2020; Huang & Zhao, 2020; Mertens et al., 2020; Nasir et al., 2021) . In a study, it was found that the social distancing rule causes obsessive-compulsive behaviors in households and that the pandemic lasts longer than expected causing excessive and unwarranted fear in the household (Yurtkulu and Ak\u00e7ay, 2021) . Therefore, fear of COVID-19 important of most studied and frequently observed negative psychological effects in humans during the pandemic period (Gonzalez-Sanguino et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020; Naeem et al., 2020; . These problems begin with fear and anxiety, and feeling these problems, excessively, can be effective in the deterioration of the individual's mental health Ahorsu et al., 2020; Oral and Gunlu, 2021; Gunlu, 2021) . Thus, this situation prepares the ground for the formation of involuntary extreme fear in the individual (Dubey et al., 2020) . The long duration of the fear that occurs involuntarily is effective in experiencing the phobic situation. Therefore, stress, anxiety, and depression disorders are considered among psychological disorders that are effective in accelerating the emergence of some phobias (Duan & Zhu, 2020) .",

Phobia is the involuntary intense fear and avoidance behavior of an individual even though individual knows that individual should not be afraid (Fernandez et al., 2020) . Phobias are divided into three groups as against a certain object (insect, snake, etc.), against a certain situation (elevator, indoor space, height, etc.), and against a certain phenomenon (social phobia, etc.) (Isaac & Mataix-Cols, 2004) . Phobias that arise against a particular object or situation are also considered in the specific phobia category (Sadock, & Sadock, 2005) . In order for the fear developed against a situation or object to be defined as a phobia, it needs to continue for a longer period than the usual and temporary fear. In addition, an individual's experience of disproportionate fear and anxiety in the face of a situation is sufficient for the individual to be described as a phobia (APA, 2013) .",

Indeed, COVID-19 pandemic era and its anxiety symptoms increase phobic reactions (Paol, et al., 2020) . However, it is known that in pandemics, individuals' phobic reactions are triggered in major natural events (Furedi, 2014; Witthauer et al., 2016) . During the SARS and MERS era, people were extremely afraid of infection, and even phobic reactions may be seen in some individuals (Jeong, et al., 2016) . Researchers emphasize that even though the pandemic is under control, psychological disorders will continue to be seen in individuals until a certain period of time has passed (Duan, & Zhu, 2020; Ornell et al., 2020; Steinberg, & Daniel, 2020) . Due to the asymptomatic feature of COVID-19, the stress and anxiety of the individual may increase because the individual does not know whether they carry the virus (Aslan, 2020; Gunlu et al., 2021; G\u00fcven, 2020; Kissler et al., 2020) . Many countries and regions have seen increases in the number of cases as social distance policies have been relaxed. Some doctors believed that social distance policies may be needed for up to several years (Lonergan & Chalmers, 2020 ). Due to the over-protection behavior from the virus, the effort to keep the distance between people and their surroundings is increasing. For this reason, people can experience intense fear and take the process out of their control. This attitude can lead towards a phobic situation. COVID-19 is the longest-running virus among the types of coronavirus seen from the past to date and affects the whole world. The continuing effect of COVID-19 and the fact that the third wave is experienced show that perceptions about COVID-19 need to be examined in depth. Thus, previous researchers developed and validate varied scales measuring (such as Fear of COVID-19 Scale (Ahorsu et al., 2020) , COVID-19 Anxiety Scale (Bi\u00e7er et al., 2020) . In addition, the most effective ways in psychological health are the activation of the necessary prevention and intervention services without deteriorating health (Gao et al., 2020) .",

This sometimes comes to such a level that the functionality of the individual may be impaired. Although the individuals are aware of the extreme situation, they cannot act. This situation leads the individual towards the phobic situation (Lee et al., 2016) . It is suggested by the researcher to define this situation as \"social distancing phobia.\" \"Sodisphobia\" is a term abbreviated for the social distancing phobia suggested by the researcher. However, it is suggested that people with social distancing phobia should be named \"sodisphobic.\" It can be defined as people who experience excessive anxiety of getting virus while using common areas in social life. Since the individual has the behavior of constantly controlling his environment due to social distancing phobia, he does not fully focus on the task that he has to do at that time. It may cause adverse effects (Dixit, et al., 2010) .",

As the theoretical basis of the social distancing phobia has been explained above, it is thought that the individuals is concerned about not being able to maintain the physical distance between themselves and the other people with a momentary absenteeism (K\u0131y\u0131c\u0131, 2021) . The individual does not need to be in contact for social distancing phobia to occur because the virus can be transmitted by approaching any infected person in cases where social distancing cannot be maintained without touching. Therefore, based on the current research data, it is thought that the phobia experienced in pandemic situations can be conceptualized with the concept of social distancing phobia. In addition, when the relevant literature is scanned, it is seen that the DSM-V-specific phobia diagnostic criterion can also be used for social distancing phobia (Arpaci et al., 2020) . The symptoms used in the definition of social distancing phobia include excessive anxiety, heart palpitations, dry mouth, dizziness, feeling of losing control, do not be in panic, sweat, excessive hygienic behavior when touching others because they have been infected, do not be afraid of other people, and not going out of the house to avoid contact with other people (DSM-V).",

This situation seems to be a very difficult process for people. Therefore, it is important to determine the phobic tendencies of individuals in these periods (Labrague & Santos, 2021) . However, in the literature review, it was seen that there was no scale developed on social distancing phobia during the COVID-19 period and previous epidemic periods. In the literature, only one study used the concept of social distancing phobia. Social distancing phobia was used for the first time in a study by Gunlu (2021) . In the study conducted by Gunlu, it was determined that the participants felt extremely stressed and tense when they were shopping or in environments where other people were present. In the event that this process is excessive, this situation may disrupt the functionality of the individual, as the process in which the individual is running escapes from control. Although the individual knows that this situation is unrealistic fear and anxiety, he cannot overcome the phobic tendency towards the virus. This situation is also expressed as somesphobia (Gunlu, 2021) . And so, it is observed that a scale measuring phobic tendency is needed to meet this need in the literature. One aim of this research is to develop the social distancing phobia scale. Another aim of this research is to examine the role of generalized anxiety disorder of the individual in predicting social distancing phobia and perceived stress. determination of the level of prediction. With this scale, which has been added to the literature, it is thought that the current research is important in terms of determining the level of phobia experienced in individuals regarding compliance with social distancing and contributing to the planning of prevention and intervention programs necessary to comply with this rule in a healthy and conscious manner.",

There are also two separate forms of PSS, 10 and 4 items. In the present study, the 10-item form of the PSS was used. Therefore, the scores that can be taken from the scale vary between 0 and 40. In the adaptation study, the Cronbach alpha reliability of the scale was calculated as 0.82; in the present study, the Cronbach alpha reliability value was calculated as 0.72.",

In addition, in the development of the test, the selected test techniques, item formats, test structure, and procedures were chosen at a level that would be suitable for everyone. However, a systematic way was followed in terms of both language and psychology for the correct functioning of the testing process (Coster & Mancini, 2015) .

In line with this suggestion, the correction suggestions in the error variances of the items were taken into consideration while performing the procedure.

Scholars had argued that under certain conditions, the dimensionality and item structure of the scale are found to be sample specific (Henson and Roberts, 2006) . Thus, there is always a need to test the psychometric properties of the sodisphobia scale. Given this, first, develop a scale and test it on the pilot sample. And then scale tested on the sample-1, while validated the results on a much larger sample-2. Finally, the role of the individual's generalized anxiety disorder in predicting social distancing phobia and perceived stress was examined in sample-3. The overall findings of the scale suggest that the three-sub-dimensional sodisphobia scale is the best fit to capture individuals' physiological, emotional, and behavioral response, among the general populations.",

As can be seen, in the present study, it was determined that the values of all items were well above this value. The first dimension of the scale, \"physiological response\" sub-dimension, includes the physiological reactions seen in individuals due to the uncertainty of not being able to maintain social distancing in the presence of the virus. In this sub-dimension, symptoms such as increased heart rate, excitement, and chest tightness were observed during compliance with the social distancing rule. The second sub-dimension is the \"emotional response\" sub-dimension. Emotional reactions such as fear, stress, restlessness, and anxiety are observed in this sub-dimension. The third sub-dimension is the \"behavioral response\" sub-dimension. In this sub-dimension, behavioral responses such as avoiding closed spaces and avoiding physical contact while obeying the social distancing rule were observed.",

Another result obtained in the present study is that there is a positively significant relationship between generalized anxiety disorder, perceived stress, and social distancing phobia. In addition, according to the results of multiple linear regression analysis, it was determined that generalized anxiety disorder significantly predicted perceived stress and social distancing phobia. In a study, it was determined that being in contact with someone infected with COVID-19 increases the anxiety and stress of individuals (Brooks et al., 2020) . In some studies in the literature, it is stated that an unwarranted fear and anxiety occurred during the pandemic period. It has been determined that this fear and anxiety are seen at higher levels due to factors such as who is the carrier of the disease and who is not Wang, et al., 2020) and fear of contamination and infecting loved ones (Haider et al., 2020) . Studies have shown that the stress and anxiety levels of individuals increased significantly during the pandemic era and that stress and anxiety were positively correlated with each other (Lee et al., 2016; Liu, et al., 2020; Wang, et al., 2020) .
