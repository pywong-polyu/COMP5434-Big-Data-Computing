Participants: A total of 132 women ages 20 to 69 years women. Methods: This prospective longitudinal study enrolled 132 CIN women who were evaluated three times. Propensity score matching was used by controlling subjects' age strata, body mass index, education level, occupation, and type of surgery. Results: The influences of various educational tools were investigated. Four domains were assessed, including health behavior, attitude towards behavior change, self-efficacy of behavior, and cervical cancer (CCa) literacy. Significant improvements in behavior change and CCa literacy due to a health education program were observed (p \u2264 0.002). The App combined with a traditional booklet had the highest score for behavior change and was significantly greater than the booklet-only learning (p = 0.002). The App-assisted form, either App alone or combined with booklet, had a significantly better impact on health promotion when compared to the booklet alone (p = 0.045 and 0.005, respectively). App-only learning had the highest score of CCa literacy (p = 0.004). Conclusion: Health education interventions can have positive effects in terms of change of behavior and CCa literacy. App-assisted learning could be used as a supportive technology, and App learning alone or combined with a traditional booklet may be an innovative model of clinical health promotion for women with CIN.",

Furthermore, health education 2 of 16 interventions were significant in terms of improving knowledge and perceptions and increasing the self-efficacy of women with regards to cervical cancer and screening [2] ; those with inadequate health literacy were more likely to undergo irregular cervical cancer screening [3] , and married women's knowledge levels about cervical cancer and Pap smear screening were increased as their self-efficacy level, and health literacy level increased [4] . In Taiwan, a cervical cancer screening program for women over 30 years of age, who are eligible for one free Pap smear annually, had decreased 69.5% age-standardized incidence rate of invasive cervical cancer and 70.9% age-standardized mortality rate of cervical cancer since 1995, but the screening coverage was only 50.4% in 2019 [5] . Women with inadequate health literacy tended to not follow the Pap smear routine screening [3] . In Taiwan, the coverage rate of National Health insurance (NHI) was 99.9%, and the universal service coverage index (SCI) was 87.0% which was only lower than Canada according to the WHO report [6] . The challenges of increasing the cervical screening rate would be how to facilitate health education and literacy of cervical cancer, provide screening reminders, and deliver reports [7, 8] , especially in areas without digital cervicography reading or with inadequate health worker training [9] .",

Recently, some smartphone apps were designed to address the COVID-19 pandemic [15] , while an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) program led to significant reductions in depressive symptoms [16] . For some disease-specific populations, the aggressive use of health-related applications (Apps) on mobile phones could be useful for clinical health promotion. In line with the current trend for care to be provided nearer patients' homes, telephone interventions have been demonstrated to provide a convenient way of supporting self-management of cancer-related symptoms for adults with cancer; this could be augmented by combining telephone interventions with face-to-face meetings and the provision of printed or digital materials [17] . A previous study reported that people appreciated the timeliness and convenience of mHealth [18] but resisted change [19] . It was very important to establish an effective and convenient health education method to help those newly diagnosed patients. In the past, a rare study of mHealth education was performed to compare the effectiveness between different tools. An orthopedics study indicated that using an App and a booklet with the same health education context led to similar cost-effectiveness ratios and the same occurrence of recurrent rates [20] . A recent review pointed that mHealth intervention was effective in increasing participants' knowledge of cervical cancer and screening rate in clinics, but the evidence of its effectiveness was not comprehensive [21] .",

Self-efficacy may also be seen as confidence in one's ability to perform well in a domain of life that may be associated with improved health behavior or a decreased disease burden. Patients with various cancers may benefit from the support of an App-based health promotion program in terms of advancing health literacy [22] , enhancing related behavior changes, such as self-efficacy and self-management [23] , reducing nursing care needs, and improving quality of life after surgery [24] . App-assisted health education is an innovative model used to increase health literacy and improve health-related behaviors, including self-efficacy of behavior and positive behavioral change, and may be useful in some cancer patients.",

Because diagnostic procedures took around 6 months for an LSIL to be confirmed of histology of CIN [25, 26] , all the targeted patients were followed for 6 months before enrollment. Before the study period, women having one CIN cytology report or atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) report would be excluded from a cancer situation. Finally, all the targeted women had more than two cytology or histology CIN reports, and there were 148 patients included in the next stage (see Figure 1 ).

In the present study, biostatistical software was used to perform the multiple propensity score [28] . First, all the socio-economic variables and gynecological evaluations (such as Pap smear result, CIN grade) of 148 candidates were collected and calculated by a multiple logistic regression analysis. Second, the propensity score matching method was used, and their suggested matching IDs were produced by the biostatistical software. Third, the suggested matching IDs were double-checked to prove the consistency of grouping and complete the matching process. The 148 candidates who were invited and agreed to attend this study were arranged into three groups based on their multiple propensity scores matched by controlling subjects' age strata, body mass index classification, education level, occasion status, and type of surgery. There was 1 participant who progressed to CCa, 6 participants declined, and 9 participants were excluded CIN due to only one abnormal Pap smear result. At the end of the follow-up period, 132 women with a defined CIN participated in the subsequent part of the study (see Figure 1 ).",

Owing to the complex study design, the GLM method was used to simulate and evaluate the effects of the App-assisted educational intervention, based on actual data for the second and third groups at Time-2 and Time-3. Regarding health behavior, the introduction of the App combined with the booklet resulted in a gradually increasing trend (see Figure 3A) . Focusing on the effects on attitude towards behavior change and cancer literacy, all three educational models resulted in increasing trends over time (see Figure 3B ,D). Conversely, all three models had simulated decreasing trends in self-efficacy over time (see Figure 3C ). GLM analysis was used to investigate the interactions between different measurement times and different tools. At Time-2, the actual difference between booklet-form and App-form learning could be estimated, while at Time-3, the actual difference between booklet-form and App combined with booklet-form learning could also be estimated (see Figure 1 ). Remarkably, interactions of measurement times and different tool types could be assessed and were significant in the behavior change domain (F = 3.2, p = 0.043) and the health promotion subscale (F = 4.5, p = 0.012) (see Table 3 ). In general, the App combined with the booklet resulted in the highest score for attitude towards behavior change, which was significantly greater than the score for booklet-only learning (24.6 vs. 24.1, respectively, p = 0.002); App-only learning resulted in the highest score for CCa literacy, which was significantly greater than the score for the booklet-only form (7.4 vs. 7.1, respectively, p = 0.004). In particular, for the health promotion concept within the subscale of behavior change, it was noted that App-assisted learning, either alone or combined with traditional booklet learning, had a positive effect as compared with the booklet alone (5.81 and 5.8 vs. 5.8, p = 0.045 and 0.005, respectively) (see Table 3 ).
