Moreover, airway cases, which mostly present as emergency, cannot be deferred. Being a tertiary airway centre and having received a number of airway cases, most of them requiring prompt surgical intervention, our airway surgery and anaesthesiology team had to work in conjunction to adapt and readapt the practice over the past few months, striving to achieve effective airway surgery protocols, to minimize exposure and prevent transmission of COVID 19. To enlist the encountered airway cases during COVID 19 pandemic and to highlight the important inclusions and adaptations in executing the airway surgeries. A retrospective observational study of 7 months duration was carried out. This is a single institutional study, where the sample included the primary as well the referred airway cases. Apart from Tracheotomy, Foreign body bronchus removal, Dilatation of Laryngotracheal Stenosis (LTS) and excision of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP), we also have had the experience to deal with congenital Laryngo-tracheo-oesophageal Cleft (LTOC) Type III b, Thyroid surgery to relieve tracheal compression and Bilateral Choanal Atresia repair during the last 7 months. Routine 2 weeks follow up of the patients have been favourable, as there has not been any report or clinical features of transmission of COVID 19. As the airway surgeries could be executed with the incorporation of certain change in practice and as the follow up revealed no evidence of transmission, we attempt to contribute to airway best practice guideline for maintaining the safety of patients and health professionals.",

The first case of the COVID 19 pandemic in the Indian state of Assam was reported on 31 March 2020. Initially, in our region, the statistics showed a controlled number of cases. However from the latter half of May, there has been a steady rise in the number of positive cases, and currently as on 30th September, it stands at more than 89,000 confirmed cases. Such a backdrop presents unique challenges for Otorhinolaryngologists. Even more challenging is the management of airway cases. Patients with airway pathology usually seek medical attention as an emergency. The upper aerodigestive tract being the harbouring site of the virus and transmission via aerosols; airway surgeons, anaesthesiologists, and operating room (OR) personnel are subjected to high risk during any procedure. Though there are unavoidable risks and difficulties related to transmission hazard, emergent airway surgeries or procedures cannot be left unattended or deferred. For the benefit and safety of such patients and health personnel, revised safety guidelines or precautions have to be instituted. To deal with airway cases during COVID times, particularly those which require surgical intervention, there has to be an excellent co-ordination between the surgeon and anaesthesiologist as both can work in conjunction to devise adaptations to minimize aerosolisation.",

            "text": "Otorhinolaryngology practice has been tremendously affected because of the COVID 19 pandemic scenario, as the clinical examination and intervention involved were mostly aerosol generating procedures (AGP). In the early days, when the pandemic hit the Indian nation and extensive lockdown was imposed, a lot of patients with Otorhinolaryngology non-COVID ailments had to face the brunt. But gradually guidelines and protocols were formulated for the service of such patients who required nondelayed medical or surgical attention. We are particularly focusing on airway cases, as most of them required prompt intervention, which if failed to deliver, might result either in mortality or long standing morbidity. Our hospital, being a tertiary airway centre, and having received a good number of such cases (adult and paediatric), have been focusing on ways or adaptations to ensure safe airway surgery, to minimize the COVID 19 viral transmission and to contribute to the best practice guidelines. As the most commonly performed emergency airway surgery is tracheostomy/tracheotomy and which might be urgently required in any centre, the guidelines and adaptations have been highlighted. Some other pertinent surgical adaptations for minimizing aerosol generation include-preference of closed airway surgery over open, wherever feasible; use of cold steel instruments; limited use of coblater and microdebrider is encouraged over electrocautery and LASER. Anaesthesia adaptations are equally important as both intubation and PPV are highly AGPs; hence have been discussed. All our cases as well the associated health personnel have shown no clinical features of COVID 19 infection on follow-up. Hence we believe that with the inclusion of proper adaptations and protocols, airway surgeries can be safely optimized. Though surgical techniques' adaptations or preference might vary and be casespecific, but the general protocols of maintaining safe practice should be diligently followed. There are several other adaptations which we are still working on. We believe that even with the dawn of vaccines in the near future, we believe the safety norms should not slackened. There is a lot to learn and absorb from this ongoing pandemic. By sharing our experience, we are suggesting that interventions in airway cases need not be unnecessarily delayed; as by making relevant adaptations and by adhering to strict protocols, it is possible to carry out safe airway practices. It is, hereby, our humble attempt at contributing to the best airway surgical practice guidelines, not just to be implemented during this pandemic, but also can be carried forward in the post-pandemic era to ensure greater safety standards of both health personnel and patients.",
