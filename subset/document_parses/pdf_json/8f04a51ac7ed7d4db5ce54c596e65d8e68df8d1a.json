            "text": "Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as the N95 respirator, is essential for the protection of healthcare workers from severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, because of the global shortage of N95 respirators arising from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, extended use (ie, wearing the same N95 respirator for repeated encounters with different patients) or reuse (ie, using the same N95 respirator by one healthcare worker for multiple encounters with different patients but removing after each encounter) of N95 respirators is commonly practiced in many healthcare settings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that extended use of N95 respirators can be considered in contingency capacity strategies, and limited reuse also can be considered in crisis capacity strategies. 1 The maximum recommended extended use period of N95 respirators is 8-12 hours. For reuse, if no manufacturer guidance is available, no more than 5 uses per device is recommended. 2 However, data regarding the safety of reuse and extended use of N95 respirators are limited, and possible reduction in filtration efficiency over time and inadequate seal after multiple donning and doffing are concerning. A recent study performed during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that fit failure was associated with higher number of shifts, donning and doffing, and hours worn 3 ; however, the fit test used in this study was qualitative in nature. Therefore, we performed a quantitative fit test to examine the rate of fit failure after extended use and reuse of N95 respirators.",

The overall fit factor was calculated using an equation provided in the protocol of the Portacount device. The overall fit factor ranged from 0 to 200 and was calculated as the ratio of the concentration of a challenge agent outside the respirator to the concentration of the challenge agent that leaked inside the respirator (C out /C in ). A fit factor of >100 was considered as \"passing.\" The participants wore 3M 1870\u00fe (3M, Maplewood, MN) because they had previously undergone a quantitative fit test and passed with the 3M 1870\u00fe mask.

If fit failures occurred, refitting by investigator assistance and refit tests were permitted in both experiments. As we observed an unexpectedly high rate of fit failure after 2 consecutive 1-hour donning sessions and a single 3-hour donning session, we additionally performed a third experiment composed of a single 1-hour donning and fit test, and a single 2-hour donning and fit test. While N95 respirators were worn, the participants were not involved in actual clinical care. During the 1-, 2-, and 3-hour trials, they performed routine activities as infection control practitioners including office work with sitting at a desk, phone calls, talking with one another, and walking in the wards. We plugged the hole with tape just after fit test and reused the respirator. We assumed that a punctured mask would not fail the subsequent fit tests.",

Refitting invariably resulted in an appropriate fitting. These data suggest that the extended use or reuse of N95 respirators due to the shortage of N95 respirators and other practical issues should be done with caution, especially in high-risk settings such as those involving aerosol-generating procedures. Therefore, more short-term use or other strategies such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) should be considered in these circumstances. When caring for patients with COVID-19, healthcare workers usually don PPE during their 3-to 4-hour shifts. Therefore, the extended use of N95 respirators is unavoidable. In addition, because of the ongoing shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic, the reuse of respirators is common practice in many healthcare settings. Previous studies showed that donning up to 5 times was associated with a relatively low failure rate (<10% and 30%) 5,6 ; however, in those studies, the participants wore the N95 respirators for only about 5 minutes, which is far shorter than the usual usage in real-world practice. Therefore, we performed experiments with repetitive 1-hour and 3-hour donning sessions and observed high rates of fit failures.",

Failed fit tests may not directly indicate higher risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the concentration of the challenge agent used in the fit test may not mimic the clinical conditions of caring COVID-19 patients. However, empirical experience warrants that the adequate fit factors should be maintained during the wearing of N95 respirators in healthcare settings until more data are available. Further study is needed to evaluate the association between fit failures of N95 respirators due to extended use or reuse and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

We did not perform these experiments in the setting of patient care for COVID-19 because holes were made in the N95 respirators to insert probes for measurements. Therefore, infection control practitioners performed this study. The activity of healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 may be greater than that of infection practitioners and thus associated with higher rates of fit failure. Also, the participants in this study were highly specialized infection control practitioners who were well educated in mask fitting, and the fitting factors of N95 respirators may be somewhat poorer in nonspecialized healthcare workers. Therefore, the actual fit failure rate may be higher in real-world practice. Notably, although we plugged the hole with tape, the hole might have influenced the subsequent fit-testing results. Lastly, our findings should be interpreted with caution because the rather small number of participants in our study (n = 10) solely consisted of Asian female subjects and because only 1 brand of N95 respirator was tested. Despite these limitations, our study systemically evaluated the quantified fit factors according to the reuse or extended use of N95 respirators, which closely reflects the real-world practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
