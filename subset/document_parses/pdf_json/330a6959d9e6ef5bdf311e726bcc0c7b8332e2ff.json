In the following weeks, the virus spread quickly all over the world with dramatic consequences for global health. Different reports provide descriptions of the clinical signs associated with COVID-19 with disease expression ranging from mild infection to severe acute respiratory distress. [2] [3] [4] [5] In most of the cases, symptoms are mild, as reported by Wu et al.; however, in older patients and patients with comorbidities, COVID-19 tends to progress more severely. 6, 7 The reference standard test in the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect viral nucleotides from specimens obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, or tracheal aspirate. 8 Computed tomography (CT) is considered as an important tool to diagnose COVID-19 infection in patients with false negative RT-PCR and in patients from high prevalence sites with limited RT-PCR as well as to assess disease severity and complications in those with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. [9] [10] [11] A key point in the management of inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia is deciding whether patients require ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation. 12 Although this decision relies on multiple factors such as clinical conditions, co-morbidities, and disease severity, a delay in ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation can affect the disease outcome. 12 For this reason, better strategies in decision-making-process are searched and CT imaging could play a role in this scenario.",

[13] [14] [15] CT technique and feature analysis All chest CT scans were performed during a single full inspiratory breath-hold in supine position on a 128-slice multidetectorrow CT scanner (Philips Ingenuity Core, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands). No intravenous or oral contrast media were administered. The CT examinations were performed at 120 kV, 226 mAs (using automatic tube current modulation -Z-DOM, Philips), 1.08 spiral pitch factor, 0.5-second gantry rotation time and 64*0.625 detector configuration. One-mm thick images were reconstructed with soft tissue kernel using 512 \u00d7 512 matrix (mediastinal window) and with lung kernel using 768 \u00d7 768 matrix (lung window). CT images were reviewed on the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) workstation equipped with two 35 \u00d7 43 cm monitors produced by Eizo, with 2048 \u00d7 1536 matrix.",

In our cases of SARS-coV-2 infection, we observed a greater number of men than women, as reported in other studies 22 and a gender difference in ICU patients, with a predominance of males. The gender difference could be explained, as reported by Jaillon et al., by a sexual dimorphism in the innate response with higher susceptibility to infections in males. 23 Cough was the most common presenting symptom followed by dyspnea, and the mean duration of symptoms was 1 week. Although 50% of patients had fever, there were no statistically significant differences in the presence of high temperature in the two groups under analysis; this suggests that fever was not a useful criterion to determine the severity of illness in our study cohort. 24 The median age of the patients admitted to the ICU was 60 \u00b1 11 years, with no statistically significant difference in comparison to non-ICU patients, this might suggest that age alone is not a risk factor for ICU. 25 The proportion of ICU admissions represents 10.5% of the total cases, this percentage is higher than what was observed in prior studies from China; 26 though, these data are in agreement with other Italian studies. 27 This could be explained, as suggested by Grasselli et al., by a demographic difference between the populations in two countries. 27 ICU patients had more comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In particular, the presence of emphysema is associated with higher mortality, so an underlying lung disease affects the clinical outcome. 28, 29 Compared with the non-ICU group, ICU patients had higher incidences of positive CRP and increased LDH values. CRP levels were positively correlated with lung lesions and disease severity, and CRP levels correlate well with the level of inflammation. 30 The baseline characteristics and laboratory findings of subjects enrolled in the study are summarized in Table 1 .",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first report of Italian patients that compared CT findings of ICU patients with non-ICU patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study, we found that the most common CT imaging features were GGO, consolidation, mixed of both and crazy-paving pattern. The CT findings are closely related to the physiological and pathological basis of the disease. According to Xu et al. pathological findings in COVID-19 patients resemble those seen in SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. 31 Moreover, COVID-19 shows CT similarities to SARS and MERS pneumonia 32, 33 and other lung disease. 34 . Chest CT undoubtedly may play a key role in differential diagnosis. Specific CT features can help in the proper diagnosis, such as centrilobular nodules, mucoid impaction or unilateral involvement to diagnostic a bacterial or superinfection pneumonia. On the other hand, septal lines, large pulmonary vein suggest a pulmonary edema. 34 Li et al. assessed in their research the rate of misdiagnosis of COVID-19 at the CT admission. The authors reported a low rate of missed diagnosis (3.9%) based on CT features. 35 Furthermore, Fang et al. compared the sensitivity of chest CT with that of RT-PCR at the initial patient presentation, The authors reported that the sensitivity of chest CT was greater compared to RT-PCR (98 % vs 71%, p<0.001). 36 GGO were defined as hazy increased opacity of lung without obscuration of bronchial and vascular margins, its formation results in incomplete filling of the alveolar cavity and mild interstitial thickening. 37, 38 Consolidation was defined as an exudate or other product of disease that replaces alveolar air. In this scenario, it could be related to diffuse alveolar damage. 38 These findings are common in patients with COVID-19. 18, 39, 40 Whereas crazy paving has not often been observed as GGO and consolidation, 39 and may be related to thickening of interlobular and intralobular interstitial. 18, 39, 41 According to a recent study comprising 21 patients with COVID-19, crazy paving pattern can be a marker of COVID-19 peak stage. 41 Another CT finding present in our cohort of patients was reverse halo sign, this was described in several COVID-19 patients, 42 which could be related to disease progression 43 and may reflect an organizing pneumonia pattern in COVID-19 cases. 44 Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU group has shown higher frequency of consolidation and mixed lesions. The pathological bases of these changes are not currently clear. Consolidation indicates that alveolar air is being replaced by inflammatory exudation, and in COVID-19 patients histological examination showed that consolidation may be referred to cellular fibromyxoid exudates. 31 Moreover, ICU patients showed a greater bilateral lung involvement (Figure 2 ). The CT findings between the two groups are summarized in Table 2 .",

            "text": "In our study, laboratory parameters and clinical characteristics, such as PCR, cough, fever, duration of symptoms and nodes involvement showed significant positive correlation with the number of lobes involved by pneumonia. These findings may be related to a gradual increase in lung involvement over time with the occurrence of severe inflammation and it could be considered as a marker of disease progression. 18, 43 In addition, CT reports showed lymphadenopathy in 27% of the patients analyzed, a higher prevalence of nodal involved than in previous studies. This observation is not concordant with studies in Chinese populations. 3, 13 Lymphadenopathy could be considered as an uncommon feature of COVID-19, such as in viral pneumonia. Recent research of ICU patients reported increased lymph node involvement compared with the Chinese populations. 18, 40, 43, 45 As reported by Sardanelli et al. lymphadenopathy may be considered a predictor of a worse outcome, and the differences in disease severity could probably explain this discrepancy in different studies. 18, 45 Furthermore, ICU-patients showed greater number of lung lobar involvement (Table 3) by consolidation and GGO, as reported in previous studies, 41, 46, 47 and may help us make an early identification of patients that require ICU from patients who do not. Our results are in line with the current literature. 20, 48 Ruch et al. reported that quantification of CT lung lesion involvement is related to ICU admission, especially in patients with lung involvement >50%. 20 This study has several limitations. First, the retrospective nature of our analysis. Secondly, the data of the two groups were not balanced, because too few ICU patients were included in this study, which decreased the reliability of the statistical results. Further studies with more patients, especially patients who require ICU, are warranted. Third, the quantitative method for measuring the pulmonary involvement may have subjectivity and we cannot rule out the possibility of concomitant superinfection due to bacterial pneumonias, aspiration, and pulmonary edema. In conclusion, the results of this study confirm that chest CT is important in the diagnosis and management of the SARS-coV-2 infection. The CT features of the COVID-19 pneumonia were different in ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients, we found more consolidative lesions in critically ill patients and a greater pulmonary involvement. Our data suggest CT could be a useful tool for stratify patients who require ICU.",
