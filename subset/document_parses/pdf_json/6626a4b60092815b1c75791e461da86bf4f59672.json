The study is developed within a multiscale framework accounting for the interaction of different spatial scales, from the small scale of the virus itself and cells, to the large scale of individuals and further up to the collective behaviour of populations. An interdisciplinary vision is developed thanks to the contributions of epidemiologists, immunologists and economists as well as those of mathematical modellers. The first part of the contents is devoted to understanding the complex features of the system and to the design of a modelling rationale. The modelling approach is treated in the second part of the paper by showing both how the virus propagates into infected individuals, successfully and not successfully recovered, and also the spatial patterns, which are subsequently studied by kinetic and lattice models. The third part reports the contribution of research in the fields of virology, epidemiology, immune competition, and economy focused also on social behaviours. Finally, a critical analysis is proposed looking ahead to research perspectives.",

However, this event is definitely not a black swan, although it has already had a great impact all over the world.

On their own, mathematical models do not and cannot solve the problems of biology, medicine and economics. However, once refined and informed by empirical data, they can produce insightful provisional simulations which can even uncover dynamics which were not previously observed (cf. emergent behaviour). Hence mathematical models can and should also be viewed as a tool to generate dialogue and wider communication between the hard and applied sciences.

The recent events related to COVID-19 have shown that the pandemic has exerted a huge impact on societies concerning both their social behaviour and economic strategies. This paper accounts for some specific, but highly relevant, features of the pandemic and aims to construct a framework which can hopefully contribute to developing future strategies by which governments can fight to reduce and possibly control the impact of such an event.

Kermack and McKendrick proposed and developed the first \"compartmental\" model of disease dynamics and disease spread by considering a population of individuals sub-divided into three separate classes -susceptible, infectious and recovered -with the transmission of the disease/infection being dependent upon the number of interactions between individuals and the underlying rate of infection. This is the first SIR model of disease transmission. In formulating their model in this way, the so-called reproduction number or R 0 was defined and introduced.",

Modelling the spatial spread of epidemics, although not much focussed on in general (using reaction-diffusion equations and the theory of travelling waves [35] ), has been applied to the spread of rabies [81] which led to an estimate of the speed of the invasive wave of infection. Applied to historical data from Europe, this approach has also been used to estimate the spread of the black death/bubonic plague through Europe in the 14th century [104] . Subsequent work by, e.g. Diekmann and others, has formalised much of the theory behind epidemic models and introduced structured population models [52, 53] .",

For instance, recent data shows that, in Italy, about 12% of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases required ICU admission and that, if in practice about 1 per thousand of the patients are infected at the same time, then the total ICU capacity of the country would be saturated, as reported in [37] . A natural question can be posed at this stage, namely how does the epidemic peak depend on model parameters? Moreover, we argue that the epidemic can exist in a population in some equilibrium state in which the rate of newly infected people is compensated by those who recover. Figure 7 shows the magnitude of the epidemic peak in the population (namely the maximum number of people who are infected simultaneously) and the time at which this peak occurs, as a function of \u03b1.",

A deeper analysis of this feature is further treated in Section 7. Finally, let us study the effect of implementing social distancing at a given time. Consider for instance the dynamics shown in Figure 4 , where \u03b1 = 0.4 for the whole time interval. Figures 8 and 9 show two different scenarios of implementation of social distancing. Notice that it contributes to the flattening of the infection peaks but, if not managed properly, it could be useless (for instance Figure 9 shows that a premature lifting of social distancing can actually lead to the infection exceeding the capacity of the health system.)",

Spatial homogeneity in and of itself already provides useful information and insight. However, it is only an approximation of the physical reality of how the infection is transmitted spatially and additional work is needed to study more fully the dynamics in space and the related pattern formation that is created over the spatial domain. This is not an easy task, and it should focus not only on the dynamics in open areas, but also consider movement in complex venues across interconnected areas and networks. In both cases, the venue might include restricted aggregation areas, namely zones of high contagion diffusion. This study poses challenging problems which require new ideas but at the same time opens interesting research perspectives. This subsection presents some of these perspective ideas towards possible research programs which should also include computational simulations. The literature in the field of mathematical biology, specifically the dynamics of multicellular systems, already provides some perspective ideas which can contribute to a modelling strategy for the complex system under consideration. As an example, an analytic and computational study is proposed in [21] for the transport of an epidemic population model by a reaction-diffusion-chemotaxis system. A study of the modelling of the movement of invasive cancer cells through the extracellular matrix has been developed in [120] focusing on the multiscale features of the dynamics. The second part of [120] presents a model of cell dynamics at the micro-scale for the cancer cell movement through the extracellular matrix accounting for the different way by which cells can move, namely mesenchymal and ameboid. The authors specifically apply this technique to the phenomenon of cancer invasion, but some concepts can contribute also to a deeper understanding of the problems studied in our paper. An additional problem, which cannot be neglected, is the derivation of models at the macro-scale from the underlying description at the micro-scale by asymptotic methods [16, 29] somehow inspired by Hilbert's sixth problem [74] .",

Therefore, modelling should include this parameter of individual awareness of the risk of infection which can modify in a significant way the dynamics of the crowd with respect to the dynamics in absence of such an awareness. The role of \u03c3 is that the directional strategy is dominated by the search for low concentration trajectories rather than attraction towards the stream which generate high concentration.

Phages, viruses infecting bacteria, are essential for areas as diverse as the ecosystem of the oceans and gut health, and epidemics caused by plant and animal viruses make severe impacts on agriculture and human health. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is a prominent example [141] . Like SARS-CoV and MERS, which caused outbreaks in 2003 and 2012, respectively, it is a betacoronavirus. However, in contrast to these viruses it has evolved properties that make it far more dangerous, such as its ability to spread between hosts with ease, and in many cases stay asymptomatic for a significant time after infection. Mathematical modelling of individual viral particles can play a key role in understanding how changes in viral genomes due to mutation result in dramatically different properties of the virus.",

Viral genomes encode instructions for the production of the proteins required to build progeny virus (the structural proteins), as well as proteins with a range of other functions in the viral life cycles. This includes virally encoded polymerases required that catalyze genome translation and transcription, and in larger and more complex viruses (such as HIV) also proteins to counteract host defense mechanisms. The genetic information is stored in the form of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Smaller viruses, with genomes ranging between about 1k to 30k nucleotides (nts) in length, mostly have RNA genomes, whilst larger viruses predominantly use DNA and can have genomes up to a size of 2.5M nts. However, all viruses face the same challenge of protecting their genomes between rounds of infection. For this, they use protein containers, called viral (nucleo)capsids, and/or a lipid membrane, within which the genetic material is packaged. In RNA viruses, genome packaging usually occurs concomitant with capsid assembly, whilst in larger and more complex viruses, additional molecular machinery (packaging motors) is required in order to package the genome into a preformed capsid.",

            "text": "For RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, that package their genomes during particle assembly, an understanding of viral geometry is important. This is because the geometric shapes of the structural proteins and their assembly properties are intimately linked [131, 132] , and also affect other aspects of the viral life cycle, such as the structural transitions that in some viruses are important for infection [76] . In particular, in order to attribute as little coding sequence as possible to the viral capsid -a phenomenon called the principle of genetic economy -viruses encode blueprints of only a minimal number of distinct proteins (as small as one for the simplest form of virus), that are then repeatedly synthesized from the same genome segment, thus delivering multiple identical copies for virus assembly. As multiple identical proteins form the same types of interactions with each other, this results in protein assemblies with symmetry. As Crick and Watson noted in a seminal paper [46] , they must either form spherical shells with the symmetries of the Platonic solids -as is the case in icosahedral viruses, which constitute the vast majority of viruses -or be rod shaped. RNA viruses with large RNA genomes, such as coronaviruses, typically exhibit helical geometries. This is, perhaps, as their long genomes would be difficult to compact inside a spherical container. Coronaviruses, by contrast, wrap their 30k nt long genomes around a helical core formed from the nucleocapsid (N) protein [40] . The nucleocapsid complex, formed from genomic RNA and N protein, is enveloped by a lipid membrane, the viral envelope, that is studded with three types of glycoproteins: the Spike protein (S), which is important for receptor binding and thus virus entry into a host cell, as well as the membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins. While these components are common to all coronaviruses, genetic changes in new emerging variants can lead to substantially different infection dynamics. For example, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a novel, short sequence of amino acids which enables the virus to enter the cell more rapidly than previously circulating coronaviruses [139] . Understanding how changes to the protein structure affect the dynamics of virus assembly and virus-host cell interactions can be key to the identification of effective drug targets.",

The first such theory has been proposed by Caspar and Klug in 1962, where they classified the surface architectures of icosahedral viruses formed from clusters of 5 (pentamers) and 6 (hexamers) identical protein subunits. Extensions of this theory have provided models also for viruses that fall out of this scheme, such as the noncrystallographic architectures of the cancer-causing papillomaviruses [126] , and tubular variants formed from the same proteins [127] . A mathematical approach based on Archimedean lattices, that embody the concept of identical local interactions for different types of proteins, has provided an overarching framework for the modelling of icosahedral viruses that accommodates Caspar-Klug theory as a special case [130] . A dual view, from a mathematical point of view, is to use affine extended symmetry groups to model material boundaries in icosahedral viruses [82, 76, 83, 50] . This approach is also directly applicable to the core architecture of coronavirus, which is given by a translation and rotation operation that in combination define the 70 degree angle and the helical pitch of 140 Angstrom for a unit of 16 N proteins [40] .",

            "text": "Models of viral geometry provide the opportunity to the analysis of the intracellular dynamics of a viral infection. Models of intracellular dynamics include reactions, or equations, for all processes inside the cell pertaining to viral replication. They typically include the copying of the viral genome (transcription) and protein production (translation), as well as reactions describing virus assembly [42] . In general, virus assembly is described by a single reaction. However, this misses the intricate interdependence of its different functions, both as a template for replication and as a packaging substrate. Insights into viral geometry enables refinement of these reactions [57] , and therefore provides a much more realistic view of intracellular dynamics, revealing aspects of viral life cycles that had previously been overlooked. Model outcomes can then be included into infection models at different scales, including intercellular models of within host dynamics and between host dynamics, and thus provide a foundation for a deeper understanding of viral infection dynamics. Models of the within-host progress of viral infections can be used to inform pharmaceutical interventions [68, 43] or provide insights into viral phenomenology [115] . The long genomes of coronaviruses encode at least 19 distinct proteins, which in turn results in a complex interaction network. Viral proteins frequently perform multiple roles in the viral life cycle, creating degeneracy in the network. The assembly of infectious virus particles requires non-uniform amounts of the constituent proteins, with many more structural proteins required than non-structural ones [13] . Many viruses, including coronaviruses, therefore produce shorter fragments of their genomes, known as subgenomic fragments, to control this process. Identifying these subgenomic fragments [85] is a key step for building viral life cycle models, as each fragment should be a node in the corresponding interaction network. Accurate modelling of viral life cycles is built upon comprehensive knowledge of the interactions of viral and cellular proteins and genetic material, which is still incomplete at this point and an active area of research for SARS-CoV-2.",

Better understanding of the mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2 will enable predictions of the efficacy of vaccination efforts [32, 122] . Many existing antiviral therapies are developed against widely shared viral mechanisms, such as polyprotein cleavage and genome replication, however these are often susceptible to rapid adaptation by the virus [61] .

Traditionally, this occurs through the analysis of individual viral components and their dynamic properties. For example, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, normal mode analysis and quantum mechanical computations have been used to better understand potential drug targets on viral proteins. This includes structural proteins, most importantly S-protein, which is involved in ACE2 receptor binding [116, 1] , as well as non-structural proteins, such as proteases [56] .

In the event that a physical contact takes place, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, that forms a sort of crown on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 particles, anchors the virus to the cell surface.",

Once assembled, the inflammasome activate caspases which permit the production of high amounts of important pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1, IL18, . . . ). The secretion of the mature form of these cytokines promotes the release of additional cytokines and the induction of an innate immunity inflammatory response. Moreover, inflammatory caspase 1 cleaves gasdermin D to cause cytokine release and pyroptotic cell death, a kind of programmed cell death that occurs most frequently upon viral infection. The death of virus infected cell is an effective way to block the progression of the viral infection [102] . Faced with this sophisticated series of receptors and intracellular reaction mechanisms, SARS-CoV-2 has elaborated several mechanisms to avoid viral RNA recognition or to antagonize with receptor signal transduction. The first protein coded by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA penetrated inside the mucosal cell, ORF1ab, is a chain of 16 proteins joined together. Two portions of this long protein make the cuts that free the different proteins. The activity of several of them is to interfere with intracellular reaction mechanisms: NSP1 protein prevents the cell from assembling antiviral proteins; NSP3 protein alters the regulation of cell protein, thus reducing cell ability to put in motion the antiviral mechanisms; NSP10 and NSP16 proteins protect viral RNA from destruction; NSP13. Other virus coded protein, such as ORF6 interfere with the signals activating cell reaction to viral RNA; ORF9b protein suppress intracellular signaling thus limiting antiviral defenses nonspecifically [45] . Other viral proteins interfere with the signaling downstream of IFN release: ORF3a, ORF6 viral proteins alter various steps of the signal transduction pathway that bridge the IFN receptor to the STAT proteins that activate transcription of IFN-stimulated genes [134] .",

If the virus infects and replicates in lung alveolar or cells in the cell of intestinal mucosa, the immune attack may be responsible of major pathophysiological complications. The deposition of immunocomplexes made by antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 virions triggers Complement activation, vasodilatation, inflammatory reactions, coagulation and tissue damage. Local cytokine and chemokines contribute to the local vasodilatation, recruitment of innate immunity cells and serum antibodies extravasation [100, 134] .",

The lock-down policy is implemented by reducing the parameter \u03b1, controlling for social distance. For low intensity of the lock-down, the economic damage is rather negligible (e.g. local lock-downs). Extending the lock-down after the first inflection point harshly hits the economy with more than proportional increments of the damage, while after very persistent lock-downs (second inflexion point), the cumulative damage is so high that it can only increase less than proportionally.

However the efficacy of the action is more relevant if the defence keeps a fixed value independently on the level of infection or progression. If, in addition, the defence increases with increasing values of \u03b1 and \u03b2, the efficacy is even higher. Let us now study how the explorative ability of models can be used by crisis managers who have the responsibility to take decisions about the strategy to reduce the damages generated by the spread of the infection. This additional investigation is motivated not only by biologists and clinicians, but also by economists who are charged with studying the complex interaction between the pandemic and socioeconomic systems. It is a delicate task which has to balance human safety on one side and the consequences on the wealth distribution over the society on the other. Accordingly, let us focus on the strategy to plan firstly the lock-down deemed to control the pandemic evolution and subsequently lock-open to activate production and marketing systems.",

Figure 16 presents a simulation to investigate the influence of the up-locking time, namely the delay to apply the up-locking, on the subsequent dynamics. The task of crisis managers consists firstly in providing the strategic plans to reduce and achieve effective values of \u03b1 \u2113 and T \u2113 . Subsequently, the problem consists in referring \u03b1 d to T d . The strategy depends on a variety of social and political variables which go beyond the aims of our paper.

The representation of Figure 3 is still valid, but progression of the immune system and regression of the virus should be related to well-defined medical actions. The contents of Section 4 and 5 contribute, as mentioned, to model some of the possible therapeutic actions.

It could well be for example that above some levels of diffusion, confinement does increase the spread of the disease in that it confines the interactions but increases their interaction rates. Additionally, a necessary extension entails the account for intrinsic heterogeneity among agents, e.g. young versus old, healthy versus affected by previous pathology, based in areas with clean versus polluted atmosphere. Finally, in terms of the medical treatment and crisis management, early detection, as home diagnostics by GPs, and continuous monitoring might allow to overturn congestion in hospitals.",

The organic unity of mathematics is inherent in the nature of this science, for mathematics is the foundation of all exact knowledge of natural phenomena.
