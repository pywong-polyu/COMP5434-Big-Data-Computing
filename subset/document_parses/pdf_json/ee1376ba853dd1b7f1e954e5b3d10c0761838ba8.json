            "text": "Public engagement for Human Germline Genome Editing (HGGE) has often been called for, for example by the WHO. However, the impact of public engagement remains largely unknown. This study reports on public engagement outcomes in the context of a public dialogue project about HGGE in the Netherlands; the DNA-dialogue. The aim was to inquire opinions and opinion change regarding HGGE. A questionnaire was distributed on a national level (n = 2381) and a dialogue level (n = 414). The results indicate that the majority of the Dutch population agrees with the use of HGGE to prevent severe genetic diseases (68.6%), unlike the use to protect against infectious diseases (39.7%), or for enhancement (8.5%). No indications of change in these acceptance rates as a result of dialogue participation were found. The results did provide a tentative indication that participation in dialogue may lead to less negative opinions about HGGE (\u03c7 2 (1) = 5.14, p = 0.023, OR = 0.56, 95% CI [0.34, 0.93]). While it was not a goal of the project to make people more accepting towards HGGE, this might be the effect of exposure to opinions that are less often heard in the global debate. We conclude that dialogue may lead to different outcomes for different people, depending on their characteristics and their entrance attitude, but does not appear to systematically direct people towards a certain opinion. The self-reported, impacts of dialogue participation included no impact, strengthening of opinion, enabling of forming a first opinion, more insight into the potential implications of HGGE, and a better understanding of other people's perspectives.",

The dialogue model arose from criticism on the deficit model of public understanding, where science communication is an act of educating the public to make them more accepting of science. In the DNA-dialogue project, our aim was not to make people more accepting towards HGGE, but to stimulate opinion development. Given the deficit-dialogue history and the need for evidence-based science communication practices, we wanted to scientifically investigate the effects of public dialogue on acceptance and opinions.",

Previous studies on HGGE opinions mainly focused on acceptance of various applications, showing a majority of positive attitudes towards applications for medical reasons and fatal diseases [12] . The current study replicated this approach and questioned participants' opinions more openly to obtain a more general picture [13] . Previous studies evaluating the outcomes of dialogue participation are scarce. A study by Zorn, Roper [14] showed that dialogue on human biotechnology led to increased communicative self-efficacy, more mutual understanding among participants, and convergence of participants' attitudes. The latter two may be the result of a realization among participants that the issue at hand is far more complex than originally thought [15] .",

First, public opinion polling with two independent samples of the Dutch population aimed to show national opinions and opinion changes over the DNA-dialogue project timespan. Although we would not be able to link these changes to specific events, we were interested in overall trends in the complex system of opinion development about HGGE. In case of a major event that would alter the opinions of Dutch citizens at large, these samples could also serve as reference samples for those on a dialogue level. The first sample (S1) was recruited in August 2019, before the start of the project. The second sample (S2) was recruited in April 2020, when most physical dialogues had been held and the further progress became uncertain due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Secondly, repeated crosssectional approach included independent responses of a first sample (S3) of people who signed up for dialogue participation or showed an interest in the project, and a second sample (S4) of people who had participated in one of the 27 dialogue meetings or a spin-off dialogue. Given the challenge of getting people to fill out two questionnaires, before and after dialogue, we decided to include these cross-sectional samples in our analyses while controlling for confounders. In this way, the cross-sectional approach still provides an indication of opinion change as a result of dialogue participation. Thirdly, deliberative polling included a single sample (S5) of participants who filled out our questionnaire both before and after they had participated in a dialogue meeting. Participants in S4 and S5 visited one of 15/27 dialogues or a spin-off dialogue.",

Registration for the questionnaire was also available on the DNA-dialogue website and participants could scan a QR-code linking to the questionnaire on-site at several DNA-dialogue meetings. Participants in public opinion polling were recruited via the commercial research company Motivaction. Motivaction distributed the questionnaire among members of their StemPunt research panel (ISO certified; www.motivaction.nl/panelstempunt). We included around 1200 participants in each sample (S1 and S2). Participants had to be between 18 and 75 years of age and panel members who had participated in S1 were excluded from invitation to S2. To reduce selection bias, Motivaction used regression analysis to determine propensity scores expressing their panel's deviations from the Dutch population on sex, age, educational level, region, lifestyle and value measurements, and interactions between these characteristics. In determining these deviations, the Golden Standard of Statistics Netherlands and the (bi-)annual lifestyle and value measurements of Motivaction were used as a reference [18] . Underrepresented groups received a higher propensity score, thereby increasing the chance of being selected. Within cleaned samples (S1 and S2), remaining deviations from the Dutch population were reported, allowing weighting of the data to correct for these deviations. To further prevent selection bias, invitations to participate did not reveal any information about the content of the questionnaire. Active panel members receive points for each questionnaire they complete, which can be exchanged for gift cards or donations to charity. Motivaction acts in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation. The StemPunt research panel is registered with the Dutch Data Protection Authority.",

These percentages should be interpreted carefully, as the underlying values and considerations remain unclear. Deliberation with the general public as well as with clinician groups and patients who live with severe genetic diseases, is necessary to provide insight into the severe genetic diseases for which the clinical need for and acceptance of HGGE are the highest, and why.",

Regarding acceptance of HGGE applications, none of the samples showed changes after controlling for confounders. Regarding opinions about HGGE, we found no difference for deliberative polling and differences in public opinion polling were significant but relatively small and in opposite direction of the change in the cross-sectional samples.

Participants reported that dialogue participation increased their knowledge and awareness and provided them with a better image and understanding of the arguments and opinions held by others. However, other participants also indicated that the dialogue had not influenced their perspective or that it had confirmed them in the opinion or beliefs they already had, the latter of which may have led to more attitude strength as described in previous literature [29, 31] .",

Such results that are representative for the population can be challenging to obtain when it comes to complex topics such as HGGE. Another strength is that participants in this study were engaged at various levels. This has enabled a balance between political equality and deliberation [32] ; the public opinion polls increased the reach of the DNA-dialogue project and allowed more people to inform future policy making regarding HGGE, while the DNA-dialogue meetings stimulated deliberation.",

This research setting Fisher's exact was used instead of Chi 2 . *Significant difference between S1 and S2, between S3 and S4, or within S5. required respondents to participate in a dialogue meeting and fill out the questionnaire both before and after this dialogue meeting. Respondents may have been reluctant to fill out the questionnaire, especially for a second time, given the lengthy questionnaire that was used. Participants were therefore not given a time limit to fill out the questionnaire after a dialogue meeting. Furthermore, sampling for cross sectional polling and deliberative polling was convenience-based and resulted in selection biases. Cross-sectional polling was in addition limited by the (apparent) differences in demographics between S3 and S3. The educational scale we used had a range from 1 to 8, which was converted to low (1-3), intermediate (4) (5) (6) , and high (7 and 8). A number of high school students who participated in S4 scored 3 on this scale, placing them in the low educational level category, even though they were following high school education on the highest and second highest level. To minimize actual confounding factors, future studies that evaluate the outcomes of dialogue participation should use a within-subjects design or match the characteristics of participants in the samples that are being compared. To further prevent selection biases, future studies should aim for representivity among research participants. To this end, it should be made as easy and attractive as possible for participants to fill out the questionnaire both before and after dialogue, for example with very short questionnaires that can be filled out on-site and by using incentives for completed questionnaires.",

Self-reported impacts of dialogue participation included no impact, strengthening of opinion, enabling of forming a first opinion, more insight into the potential implications of HGGE, and a better understanding of other people's perspectives. Thus, at the very least, dialogue makes participants aware of their own perspective, and in many cases allows the participants to acquire a larger context of their own perspectives in relation to those of others. Keeping the goal of societal alignment in mind, dialogue may contribute to identifying the needs and values of the public since they become more aware of these themselves, leading to better informed decisions. At the same time, being able to place one's own perspective in the context of others' may contribute to more support for future decisions.",
