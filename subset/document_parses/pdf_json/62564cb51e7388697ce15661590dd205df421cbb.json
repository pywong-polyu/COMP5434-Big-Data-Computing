Our airway analysis identified 95 asthma genes, 58 of which were not identified by transcriptome-wide association analyses using other asthma-relevant tissues. Among these genes were MUC5AC, an airway mucin, and FOXA3, a transcriptional driver of mucus metaplasia. Muco-ciliary epithelial cultures from genotyped donors revealed that the MUC5AC risk variant increases MUC5AC protein secretion and mucus secretory cell frequency. Airway transcriptome-wide association analyses for mucus production and chronic cough also identified MUC5AC. These cis-expression variants were associated with trans effects on expression; the MUC5AC variant was associated with upregulation of non-inflammatory mucus secretory network genes, while the FOXA3 variant was associated with upregulation of type-2 inflammation-induced mucusmetaplasia pathway genes. Our results reveal genetic mechanisms of airway mucus pathobiology.",

For example, severe viral respiratory illnesses in early life are associated with development of childhood asthma among subjects carrying risk variants at the 17q21 locus 3 , which contains multiple genes expressed in the airway epithelium (ORMDL3, GSDMB, GSDMA), although it is unclear through which gene(s) asthma risk is mediated [3] [4] [5] .

Approximately 50% of asthmatics exhibit persistent bronchial airway T2 inflammation (i.e., T2-high), forming the most prevalent endotype of asthma identified to date 10 .

Ideally, TWAS gene expression models should be developed in the tissue(s) of pathogenesis for the disease being studied. As such, TWAS analysis of the bronchial airway epithelium holds great promise for the identification of genes and mechanisms involved in asthma. However, obtaining enough bronchial epithelial samples to adequately power a TWAS has been challenging given that collection of these samples necessitates performance of invasive bronchoscopies. In contrast, the nasal airway epithelium, which is a bronchial surrogate tissue, can be collected in a minimally invasive manner. The nasal airway epithelium contains the same cell types and is subject to the same inhaled exposures as the bronchial airway epithelium. Moreover, we have shown that the nasal airway epithelium expresses the same genes as the bronchial airway epithelium, with highly correlated expression levels between these airway sites 14 . Importantly, we have also shown that signatures of both asthma and T2-high inflammation can be observed using nasal expression data 14, 15 .",

We then use these data to build genetic models of airway gene expression which form the basis of TWAS analyses of both adult-and childhood-onset asthma (AOA, COA), drawing on GWAS data from the UK Biobank. We reveal plausible airway genes and mechanisms underlying a large number of asthma GWAS loci. Importantly, we discover genetic mechanisms of asthma risk for the airway mucin gene, MUC5AC, and the T2 mucus metaplasia transcription factor, FOXA3. Moreover, we reveal how these cis-variants mediate trans-effects involving distinct mucus secretory networks and functionally validate their effects in vitro.

This analysis identified 4,032,782 eQTL variants (eVariants), which were reduced to 34,725 independent eVariants through forward-backward stepwise regression analysis (Fig. 1c , Supplementary Data 1). These eVariants were associated with the expression of 13,807 genes (eGenes, Supplementary Data 2), meaning that 81% of genes expressed in the nasal epithelium are under some level of genetic control. This widespread genetic regulation was maintained when restricting analysis to the 14,894 annotated protein coding genes expressed in the nasal epithelium, of which 12,215 (82%) were eGenes. Average heritability of expression among nasal eGenes was 25%, with 11% of eGenes demonstrating a heritability of greater than 50% (Fig. 1d) .

Specifically, we performed TWAS analysis with 6 other tissues: skin (sun-exposed and non-exposed), which is another epithelial tissue; ileum, which contains a mucosal epithelium; blood and spleen, two immune cell-containing tissues; and whole lung, very similar to the another COA/AOA GTEx/ UK Biobank TWAS performed recently 9 . TWAS analysis of these tissues generated between 12 and 25 AOA risk genes and between (Fig. 2b , c), reflecting the potentially unique transcriptional and pathobiological role of the nasal epithelium in asthma. Furthermore, there were over twice as many nasal-specific COA TWAS genes as there were tissue-specific COA TWAS genes found in any other tissue, including the lung. Similarly, the nasal epithelium yielded the most unique TWAS genes among the different AOA TWAS analyses (Fig. 2b, c) . One of the nasal-specific TWAS genes, interleukin-33 (IL33), for which increased expression was associated with increased asthma risk, was the most strongly associated AOA TWAS gene and the third most strongly associated TWAS gene for COA. This result is consistent with murine models of asthma showing that IL-33 is an epithelial cytokine that initiates T2 airway inflammation cascades that lead to asthma 17, 18 . We also observed strong association between increased expression of another epithelial T2 cytokine, TSLP, and risk for both COA and AOA. These results may reflect the prominent role of genetically determined increases in airway epithelial T2 cytokine production on development of both COA and AOA.",

Previously, 17q21 risk variants have been reported as eQTLs for immune cell expression of ORMDL3 and epithelial expression of GSDMB, and biological experiments support causal mechanisms for these effects 4,5,19-23 . Our nasal TWAS analysis identified 14 COA-associated genes at the 17q21 locus, including 7 that were observed only in the nasal TWAS (LINC00672, RPL19, MED1, GRB7, IKZF3, PSMD3, RARA-AS1). The strongest nasal TWAS gene association with COA was for GSDMB (p = 9.1e-124), which also showed strong colocalization with the GWAS signal (PP4 = 0.99). Interestingly, GSDMB expression was associated in COA TWAS analyses for all GTEx tissues tested. In contrast, the IKZF3 gene, which exhibited the second strongest nasal COA association (p = 3.9e\u2212106), was only detected in the nasal analysis (Fig. 3a) . This result is especially interesting considering that IKZF3 is an immune cell transcription factor gene [24] [25] [26] , suggesting that this genetic effect is originating from resident airway immune cells that are captured by our nasal brushings. Although these cell types are most prevalent in the blood, the striking lack of signal in that tissue likely relates to differences in activation and disease phenotype for immune cells when present in the blood versus in a mucosal tissue. In contrast, while we did not observe a nasal eQTL (and thus TWAS association) for the ORMDL3 gene, TWAS analysis of the blood yielded a strong association between ORMDL3 and COA status (p = 3.9e-106, Fig. 3a, b) . These analyses support the potential for multiple tissue-specific effects of the 17q21 locus on asthma pathobiology. Fig. 4a ), lending further evidence that AOA risk may be modified through these mucin genes. The association between increased MUC5AC expression and AOA risk is especially interesting given that MUC5AC is one of the two major gel-forming mucin proteins that compose airway mucus. Moreover, MUC5AC expression is known to be highly induced in T2-high asthmatics by the action of IL-13. We have previously stratified the GALA II cohort into T2-high and T2-low subjects based on nasal gene expression profiles 15 , enabling us to examine the additive and interactive effects of both T2 status and MUC5AC eQTL (rs12788104) genotype on MUC5AC expression in the GALA II cohort using multi-variable modeling (Supplementary Data 5). While this analysis did not support an interaction between these variables (p = 0.07), it did reveal rather strong additive effects on MUC5AC expression by the rs12788104 variant (\u03b2 = 0.4, p = 4.3 \u00d7 10 \u221216 ) and T2 status (\u03b2 = 0.85, p = 6.0 \u00d7 10 \u221234 ). In fact, differential expression analysis revealed that the increase in MUC5AC expression between rs12788104 GG genotype subjects and AA genotype subjects (FC = 1.63) is equivalent to the increase in MUC5AC for T2-high versus T2-low subjects (FC = 1.64). These effects are clearly observed in plotting MUC5AC expression stratified by both T2-high status and rs12788104 genotype (Fig. 4b) .",

This increase in MUC5AC protein secretion is associated with the formation of a tenacious mucus and the arrest of muco-ciliary motion, characteristic of asthma 12 . To evaluate whether rs12788104-induced upregulation of MUC5AC expression similarly penetrates to the protein level, we used the air-liquid interface (ALI) culture method to generate mature muco-ciliary airway epithelium organoid cultures from airway stem cells collected from 10 GALA II donors with the rs12788104 AA (n = 5) and GG genotypes (n = 5). First, based on culture staining for MUC5AC using fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we found a 2.4-fold increase in the number of MUC5AC + secretory cells in GG relative to AA genotype cultures (Fig. 4c , d left). We next investigated whether this increased abundance of MUC5AC protein within the epithelium also led to increased secretion of MUC5AC protein into mucus by harvesting mucus secretions from all cultures and quantifying MUC5AC protein abundance using an ELISA assay. Strikingly, we found that the GG genotype cultures exhibited a 4.6-fold increase in MUC5AC protein secretion compared to AA cultures ( Fig. 4dright) . These in vitro data confirm that rs12788104 is a MUC5AC eQTL, while providing evidence that this variant also increases MUC5AC-producing cells and functions as a protein QTL in secreted mucus.",

To investigate this, we performed a transcriptome-wide trans-eQTL analysis for the rs12788104 SNP (Supplementary Data 6). We found that the rs12788104-G asthma risk allele was associated with increased expression of seven genes after correcting for multiple testing. Strikingly, three of these genes (FKBP11, AGR2, BHLHA15) have been demonstrated to play important roles in mucus secretory cell function. Namely, BHLHA15 (aka MIST1, p-adj = 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) encodes a master transcription factor that regulates the formation and maintenance of secretory cell architecture 27 , AGR2 (p-adj = 1.3\u00d710 \u22122 ) encodes an ER-resident disulfide isomerase involved in folding MUC2 and MUC5AC proteins, which is necessary for their normal production, and FKBP11 (p-adj = 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) encodes another isomerase protein that, though not yet linked to mucin folding specifically, is induced by the transcription factor, XBP1, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) 28,29 , a pathway well-known to be activated by mucin production. Examining the 453 nominally significant (p < 0.05) upregulated trans-eGenes, we found that they were significantly enriched for multiple pathways critical to mucin production and secretion, including IRE1-mediated unfolded protein response, protein N-linked glycosylation, and ER to Golgi vesicle mediated transport, Golgi subcompartment, as well as in marker genes of mucus secretory cells determined from single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data 30 (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Data 7) . Therefore, we generated an exploratory gene correlation network, encompassing trans-eQTL genes enriched in these pathways and mucus secretory cells, to reveal connections between these functionally related genes (Fig. 4e) . We also tested these upregulated trans-eGenes for enrichment within 54 gene co-expression networks that we previously identified for the GALA II transcriptome dataset 15 , which capture distinct functional pathways within the nasal airway epithelium (Supplementary Data 8) . We found that these upregulated trans-eGenes were strongly enriched in three networks that were all characterized by mucus secretory cell function based on cell type marker 30 and pathway enrichment analyses. These data suggest that the rs12788104 variant not only increases MUC5AC expression, but also activates genes needed for the production and secretion of MUC5AC + mucus from airway secretory cells.",

Based on separate nasal TWAS analyses using these traits, we found that MUC5AC was remarkably either one among only five (for phlegm) or the only (for cough) significantly associated gene(s), with the same rs12788104 marker LD block being positively associated with report of the trait (Supplementary Data 9).

We found that both T2 status and eQTL variant genotype exerted strong additive effects on FOXA3 expression, although the effect of T2 status was 3.4-fold greater than the genotypic effect (Supplementary Data 10) . These effects are clearly observed in plotting FOXA3 expression by genotype, stratified by T2 status, where T2-low subjects had the lowest FOXA3 expression, which additively increased by genotype (Fig. 5b) . Similarly, FOXA3 expression also increased additively by eQTL genotype among T2-high subjects, with the T2-high subjects harboring the low-expressing AA genotype, exhibiting expression levels approximately equivalent to T2-low subjects with the high-expressing GG genotype. We next examined whether asthma frequency differed among children in the six strata of FOXA3 expression created by the intersection of eQTL genotype and T2 status. Interestingly, we found that frequency of asthma was higher among all three T2-high genotype groups than in any T2-low group [asthma OR (T2-high vs. T2-low) = 1.88, p = 2e-4] (Supplementary Data 11, Fig. 5c ). Strikingly, although we observed no significant genotypic effect on asthma risk in T2high subjects, we found a strong additive effect of rs8103278 genotype on asthma risk in T2-low subjects (asthma OR (additive genotypic model) = 1.71, p = 5.2E-3), suggesting that the effect of FOXA3 expression on asthma risk may only occur up to a certain threshold of expression, which is commonly exceeded in T2-high subjects. Thus, our results suggest that the greatest impact of the FOXA3 variant on asthma risk will be among T2low subjects, where possession of the high expressing genotype can drive FOXA3 expression levels up to a risk-conferring level, already eclipsed among T2-high subjects.",

In contrast, the FOXA3 trans-eGenes were either not enriched or were only marginally enriched for the three non-inflammatory mucus secretory cell networks that were strongly enriched among MUC5AC trans-eGenes (Fig. 5e) . These results indicate that genetically driven upregulation in expression of FOXA3 is sufficient to upregulate expression of genes involved in T2-inflammatory mucus metaplasia.

The majority of these genes (n = 58), were not identified by TWAS analyses using GTEx consortium expression data from other asthma-related or similar tissues (e.g., lung), suggesting that many of these genes may represent airway-specific aspects of genetically-driven asthma pathobiology. Moreover, our airway TWAS identified at least one significant gene for 32 of the 89 COA risk loci (36%) and 13 of the 40 AOA risk loci (33%) identified by the Ferreira et al. GWAS analysis of UK Biobank data used in our TWAS analysis, affirming the potential importance of airway epithelial dysfunction in asthma development. Importantly, results from these analyses and functional follow-up have revealed a potential genetic basis for two of the most verified and prevalent pathobiological aspects of asthma: T2 inflammation and mucus obstruction. We report airway cis-genetic risk variants for MUC5AC and FOXA3, alleles of which are associated with both increased expression of these genes and asthma risk. Additionally, these MUC5AC and FOXA3 cis-eQTL risk variants are also associated with trans-effects on the expression of genes contained in non-inflammatory and inflammatory mucus secretory networks, respectively. Moreover, we find that the MUC5AC cis-eQTL risk variant is also associated with increased MUC5AC protein secretion into airway mucus, and increased risk of both general chronic cough and mucus production. This study provides some of the first insights into how genetic variants may drive airway inflammation, obstruction, and general airway dysfunction, which in turn contribute to asthma development.",

We found that the nasal airway epithelium exhibited an expression profile that was highly distinct from that of any of the other 26 GTEx tissues, resulting in our identification of many genetically regulated genes that were specific to our airway analysis. In fact, two of the most important findings in this study involved genes (MUC5AC and FOXA3) that are highly exclusive to mucosal epithelial tissues. Furthermore, these genes are poorly expressed in the airway epithelium when in the absence of environmental exposures (e.g., PM, cigarette smoke) or inflammatory stimuli, which are more likely present among asthmatics 12, 32, 37, 38 . Therefore, we believe that our use of live tissue from a large number of asthmatic subjects aided in our identification of these effects. We acknowledge that the examination of childhood specimens in GALA relative to the older adult specimens in GTEx, may have influenced our results, as differences in gene expression by age have been reported 39 . We also note that many nasal airway genetic effects are not observed when analyzing lung tissue, despite the fact that lung specimens could contain highly similar bronchial airway epithelia. This result could reflect the difficulty in identifying genetic effects within cellularly diverse organ tissues, likely resulting from low power available for rarer cell types or from conflicting or inconsistent regulation of gene expression across different cell types within the organ. Indeed, a recent comprehensive scRNA-seq analysis of the human lung identified 58 different cell types, of which only 12 are airway epithelial, reflecting the cellular diversity of lung tissue 30 . Moreover, lung explant tissue like that collected by GTEx is mostly parenchymal tissue, dominated by alveolar epithelium, capillaries, macrophage/other immune cells, and fibroblasts, with a rare embedded airway. Additionally, GTEx lung tissue collection protocols directed the collection of distal lung tissue, and to avoid the collection of lung tissue with large bronchi, increasing the likelihood that bronchial airway epithelial cells would be poorly represented among GTEx lung tissue specimens 40 . Another possibility for our unique nasal findings regards differences in statistical power between the nasal and lung analyses, since the GTEx v7 lung sample size was 383 vs. the 681 nasal samples we analyzed. To evaluate this, we compared our nasal TWAS results to a recently published lung/UK Biobank-asthma TWAS 41, 42 , which used a larger set of 1038 lung donors and >400,000 subject GWAS. This analysis only identified 55 asthma TWAS genes, with only 1 of the 11 AOA and 3 of 51 COA nasal-specific TWAS genes we identified among them.

First, while we observed strong COA associations with GSDMB in TWAS analysis of both the nasal airway and blood, for IKZF3 and ORMDL3, strong COA associations were only observed in either the airway or blood, respectively, but not both. Secondly, although a subset of 17q21 genes have already been implicated in disparate mechanisms of asthma development (e.g., [1] ORMDL3 in sphingolipid homeostasis 22, 23 and the function of T cells and [2] GSDMB in pyroptosis 19, 43 ), our results suggest additional involvement of the locus based on our identification of 15 COA-associated genes across the six tissue types examined, including 14 from the airway, of which seven were airway-specific. Among these airwayspecific genes was IKZF3, a transcription factor that is not expressed by airway epithelial cells but has been implicated in T, B, and innate lymphoid cell (ILC) development [24] [25] [26] . In the GALA II network analysis, we find that IKZF3 is part of a cytotoxic T cell network whose expression is highly enriched among GALA II subjects asymptomatically infected with respiratory viruses 15 . This result is especially significant considering that variants in the 17q21 locus have been shown to interact with early-life rhinovirus wheezing illnesses to increase risk of childhood asthma 3 . Thus, given the above, the high COA risk conferred by 17q21 likely involves multiple pathobiologic mechanisms that are driven by several eQTL variants operating in different cell types/tissues.",

            "text": "In asthmatics, a prominent clinical consequence of excessive T2 inflammation is mucus obstruction of the airways, driven by mucus-metaplastic transformation of the epithelium. This transformation entails the appearance of highly specialized mucus secretory goblet cells that use modified pathways of mucin processing and secretion to produce a mucus furnished with distinctive proteins that confer pathologic, visco-elastic properties 12 . Both knockout and transgenic mouse studies, as well as human in vitro studies, have established FOXA3 as an essential transcription factor mediating this T2 mucus-metaplastic process 31, 33 . Thus, it is significant that we report here for the first time an airway eQTL for FOXA3 that confers risk of asthma, which was identified in our nasal TWAS, but not the parent GWAS analysis. The effect of this eQTL was sufficient to drive FOXA3 expression in T2-low subjects to levels equivalent to those in T2-high subjects, presenting an alternative, genetically driven mechanism for inducing mucus metaplasia in the absence of T2 inflammation. Moreover, we find that this FOXA3 cis-eQTL exerts transexpression effects on genes contained in co-expression networks associated with T2-driven mucus metaplasia, suggesting that this genetically driven upregulation of FOXA3 can itself drive metaplasia of the epithelium. Furthermore, although our results show that asthma risk may be conferred by this locus to T2-low subjects, who would otherwise exhibit low FOXA3 levels, they suggest that minimal risk is conferred to T2-high subjects, who typically reach risk-conferring levels of FOXA3 by virtue of T2 inflammation alone. Finally, a causal relationship between rs8103278 and FOXA3 is suggested by both (1) computational analyses suggesting that the rs8103278 risk allele inhibits binding of ELF1 to the motif in which rs8103278 resides, and (2) our in vitro IL-13 experiments showing that rs8103278 genotype is associated with alteration of FOXA3 expression. Interestingly, ELF1 has been reported to be induced by respiratory viral infections 47 , providing a potential asthma-related environmental exposure that could activate FOXA3 expression through this variant.",

The visco-elastic properties of airway mucus are largely determined by the concentration and ratio of MUC5B and MUC5AC mucin proteins, alterations of which are associated with lung and airway diseases [48] [49] [50] . MUC5B is generally considered to be the homeostatic mucin, whereas MUC5AC is more inflammatory, being strongly induced by T2 inflammation as well as other asthma-related environmental challenges, including particulate matter and cigarette smoke 32, 37, 38 . We have found the expression of MUC5AC and MUC5B to be up-and down-regulated, respectively, in T2-high asthmatics, significantly increasing the MUC5AC/MUC5B ratio. Moreover, previous work has found that MUC5AC acts to tether the mucin layer to the epithelial surface, which may contribute to poor muco-ciliary movement 51 . Similar to the effect of rs8103278 on FOXA3, we find that the MUC5AC eQTL drives MUC5AC expression among T2-low subjects to levels equivalent to that of T2-high subjects, suggesting a clinically significant effect. However, unlike the FOXA3 eQTL, this MUC5AC eQTL is associated with trans-effects on genes contained in distinct mucus secretory networks that appear to be unrelated to T2-driven inflammatory processes. Furthermore, this eQTL is associated with increases in both the number of epithelial mucus secretory cells and the amount of MUC5AC protein secreted into mucus. These results indicate that not only does the MUC5AC eQTL function as a secreted protein QTL, but that it can possibly stimulate epithelial cells to adopt a mucus secretory phenotype. Remarkably, this same MUC5AC eQTL was also associated with both self-reported chronic cough and chronic phlegm production based on TWAS analysis, indicating that this variant-driven mucus production may impose broader effects on respiratory health.",

            "text": "In addition to FOXA3, we identified seven other COA and one other AOA gene, not within significant GWAS loci, revealing additional aspects of genetically-driven asthma pathobiology. Interesting among these is the IQ domain GTPase-activating protein (IQGAP1) gene, which has been shown to be involved in the proliferation of bronchial airway epithelial cells and to be critical for epithelial repair from injury 52, 53 . Another of these, is the Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 66 (CCDC66) gene, which is part of centriolar satellites that are involved in cilium assembly 54 . Recently, depletion of CCDC66 from a retinal epithelial cell line was shown to block ciliogenesis 55 . However, no studies have evaluated the potential role of CCDC66 in airway epithelial ciliogenesis. This information suggests modulation of expression for these genes may mediate asthma risk through a variety of mechanisms, however, further functional studies are needed.",

Differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns between the eQTL and GWAS populations likely resulted in the loss of some airway TWAS signals, as we have previously demonstrated 56 . Despite this, we were able to identify many clinically significant, co-localized, functionally verified TWAS associations that exhibit strong biological plausibility. Therefore, the airway genetic models developed here should serve as a significant resource for the scientific community, facilitating investigation of the genetic drivers of airway expression that mediate risk for asthma and a range of other lung/ airway diseases. We also cannot rule out that some of the uniqueness of the nasal transcriptome we observed could have been driven by methodological differences in RNA-seq data generation between GALA and GTEx. Lastly, although compelling in terms of alignment with our in vivo results and known asthma/airway biology, our in vitro results will need to be confirmed in additional donors, with further investigation of the underlying mechanisms.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our work has established that a significant proportion of genetic risk for asthma may be mediated through altered gene expression within the airway epithelium. Indeed, we find evidence that these genetically regulated expression effects contribute to the most established pathobiological mechanisms of the disease (through the 17q21 locus, T2 inflammation, and mucus obstruction). Most significantly, we describe two strong cis-regulatory asthma risk variants that drive trans-effects on mucus secretory networks, thus revealing important potential mechanisms of mucus obstruction, that may be therapeutic targets for asthma and other obstructive airway diseases. Experimental methods GALA II study subjects. Nasal airway epithelial RNA-seq data was generated on Puerto Rican children in the Genes-Environment & Admixture in Latino Americans study (GALA II) case-control study of asthma. The GALA II study was approved by local institutional review boards (NJH HS-2627, University of California, San Francisco [UCSF], IRB number 10-00889, Reference number 153543). All GALA II subjects and parents provided written informed assent and written informed consent, respectively 57,58 . The GALA II study and design has been described elsewhere [57] [58] [59] and the brief clinical and demographic information are provided here (Supplementary Data 13) . In summary, the study recruited Latino asthma and healthy control children (8-21 years) , from clinics and community centers in Puerto Rico and the mainland U.S. Asthma was physician-diagnosed, with a requirements for 2 or more symptoms of coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath within 2 years of study enrollment. Exclusion criteria included: subjects in the third trimester of pregnancy, current smoking or at least a 10 pack-year smoking history. GALA II subjects completed questionnaires detailing demographic, medical, and environmental data. A blood sample was obtained to isolate DNA for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). All GALA II subjects used in this analysis were recruited from Puerto Rico (n = 695). A nasal airway inferior turbinate brushing was used to collect airway epithelial cells from GALA II subjects for whole transcriptome sequencing (n = 695). The GALA II WTS data have been used in several prior publications 12, 15, 60 . Network analyses leveraged here were performed as part of another publication 15 . The eQTL and TWAS analyses were performed on the subset of subjects (n = 681) with WGS and nasal WTS data.",
