The World Health Organization (WHO) claimed an international public health emergency for the outbreak in January and, later, a global pandemic in March 2020. As of 22 March 2021, more than 25,794,100 infected cases were reported in over 200 countries and regions. This prompted scientists to identify how the epidemic affected such a substantial amount of people in the world. Coronaviruses are known to circulate in birds and mammals, including bats [1] . Several publications have recently explored the origin of SARS-CoV-2.",

The results from Wei et al. suggested that snakes are the most probable wild animal reservoir for the virus, based on their relatively synonymous codon usage bias compared to other animal species [5] . Work from Guan and colleagues suggested that pangolins (Manis javanica) should be considered as a possible intermediate host for the novel coronavirus based on the 85.5% to 92.4% similarity of the viruses found in pangolins to a partial length (~86.3%) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence [6] . Two other studies implied that cats may be involved in virus infection and transmission [7, 8] . SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA coronavirus bearing a high frequency of RNA recombination, and the stability of the virus would be affected by environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc. [9] [10] [11] . How to keep codon-based evolution analysis of this virus accurate is therefore a perplexing and challenging question.",

            "text": "Allergenicity is referred to as the ability of an antigen to induce an aberrant or detrimental immune response in the host, which is an overreaction and different from a normal immune response in that it does not result in a protective/prophylactic effect but instead causes physiological dysfunction and/or tissue damage [12] . In the early phase of an allergic reaction, antigens are presented through major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in vertebrates and HLA (human leukocyte antigen) in humans to T cells to activate adaptive immunity [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Whether an antigen is able to be presented to T cells or not depends on the binding affinity of that antigen with MHC/HLA molecules of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The stronger the binding affinity, the more likely the antigen would be presented outside of APCs, and thus, the higher the allergenicity. Such an antigen is more likely to trigger danger signals and activate downstream inflammatory pathways and cytokine storms [12, 18] . Therefore, the binding affinity of antigens to HLA molecules is a key indicator of the allergenicity and the presentation potency of those antigens. Immunologically, proteins from SARS-CoV-2 should also be presented as antigens by APCs as they touch human bodies. High allergenicity of a viral antigen typically elicits a rapid elevation of various inflammatory factors, and often renders viral antigens liable to induce cytokine storms [19] . Profilin is a panallergen and exhibits a configuration of \u03b1-\u03b2-\u03b1 layers, a similar structure component element shared by different allergens [20] . It can induce only mild symptoms like oral allergy syndrome in the allergic population [21, 22] . Therefore, the highest values of profilin binding affinity to HLA I (\u22650.9) and HLA II (\u22650.8) molecules will be cited as the lowest cutoff values to discriminate the binding affinity of different HLA molecules to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and/or SARS-CoV.",

Briefly, the sliding window approach was used to extract peptides from the full-length spike proteins of the viruses which were 20 and 9 amino acids in length for HLA Class II and Class I alleles, respectively. Fifty kinds of HLA class II alleles and 81 kinds of HLA class I alleles were selected for binding affinity prediction.

To construct a screening program aimed at 2019 and 2002, we screened out the climate combination features that exhibited a special strong correlation between the two years; that is, the corresponding climate combination features of Wuhan 2019 are very similar to those of Guangdong in 2002 (Pearson correlation coefficient > 0.8), but are less similar to those in most other years (Pearson correlation coefficient < 0.5).",

Importantly, a locus in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the counterpart in the human SARS virus but different from the loci found in more than 90% of bat SARS-like viruses.

Through the binding affinity analysis of human SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with HLA class I and II molecules, we found those HLA alleles that are predicted to bind to the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 are very similar to those from SARS-CoV. The spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV, are predicted to bind with high affinity to five human HLA class I alleles ( Figure S3 ) and seven HLA class II molecules ( Figure S4 ). These results suggest that human SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV could induce similar strong immune responses in populations with the same genetic background.

It is worth noting that SARS-CoV also has peptides with a very high binding affinity to this HLA allele (Table S6) . Certain HLA alleles are generally prevalent in the population. For example, the proportion of the HLA allele DRB1*09:01 is 24.28% in a population of 103,259 Chinese. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of causing severe immune response in most people with the above HLA class II alleles.",

This allele has a low binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 harbors far fewer peptides with high binding affinity to HLA class I alleles than class II alleles (Tables 1 and S4 ). For example, the HLA I allele with the highest affinity to SARS-CoV-2, B*15:03, binds 97 peptides from SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity. Furthermore, the total proportion of high-affinity fragments for HLA I molecules in the total peptide fragments from SARS-CoV-2 is only 7.67%. Therefore, it would render SARS-Cov-2 more likely to induce the immune response through specific HLA class I/II molecules, resulting in distinct immune responses in different patients because of the genetic diversity of HLA genes.

In addition, the effect of meteorological factors on viral transmission and outbreak at the host population have not yet been determined. It was reported that extreme meteorological factors can accelerate the mutation of viruses [9, 10, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . In this study, in order to find out the key climatic features of two coronavirus outbreaks in Wuhan and Guangdong in 2019 and 2002, respectively, we analyzed the climate data (mean temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, hours of sunshine, relative humidity) of Wuhan and Table S5 . For example, precipitation appeared 158 times, which is the highest of all climatic combination features, accounting for 32.31% of the total combinations. In addition, 27.81% of the 406 selected combinations contained relative humidity alone, while 22.29% of them contained both relative humidity and precipitation, indicating that these are the key features of strong correlation between the climates of Wuhan in 2019 and Guangdong in 2002 ( Figure 5 ). These extreme climate factors may accelerate the viral mutation rate, which could be one of the factors causing the virus outbreak. According to a report from the Hubei Meteorological Bureau, the most serious drought in Hubei Province in the past 69 years occurred in the summer and autumn of 2019. During this abnormally long drought, much less precipitation was accompanied by hot weather. In general, a large fluctuation in temperature in Wuhan City between August and October was observed. When the maximum temperature, the minimum temperature, and the precipitation were used as the meteorological parameters from the August to October periods in the past 69 years, the results show that Wuhan 2019 was an independent branch of clustering with the actual climate characteristics ( Figure S5 ). When the mean diurnal ranges of temperature and precipitation were used as parameters, the curves showed the extreme conditions in Wuhan in 2019 in terms of high temperatures and low humidity, similar to but more extreme than the temperature-precipitation relationship in Guangdong 2002-2003 ( Figure 6 ).

The phylogenetic analysis of the virus spike proteins indicates bats as a likely natural origin and rodents as the intermediate reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. A variety of pathogenic viruses can cause hypersensitivity reactions and are threats to human health. Therefore, we evaluate the allergenicity between virus protein and host immune defenses. The results showed that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are predicted to bind to fourteen HLA class I and II molecules with super-high HLA allele-peptide affinities. Extreme climate might have promoted coronavirus to enable viral transmission and outbreak in the host population. Meteorological factors analysis shows that relative humidity and precipitation could be key factors causing the virus outbreak.",

It is of the utmost importance to quickly discover the intermediate hosts of this virus and eradicate the source in order to prevent future outbreaks. Several research groups have recently attempted to address this issue [5] [6] [7] [8] . Bats, minks, snakes, and pangolins, and many other creatures seemed to be possible candidates for the interspecies transfer of the novel virus from wildlife to humans, since these animals were sold as delicacies in this market. However, there are some challenging and unexplained facts. The first clinical cases published in The Lancet reported that >33% of the cases had no apparent link to the seafood market [2] . According to a report in the NEJM, although up to 84.5% of 1099 patients confirmed by laboratories had visited Wuhan city or had contact with Wuhan residents, only 1.9% of these patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife [38] , which indicates a high potency of humanto-human transmission of this virus beyond the seafood market origin. Strikingly, of the 585 tested environmental samples, including 70 taken from the wildlife-trading shops and 515 collected from the COVID-19 patients served in shops and related blocks, 33 samples, 31 from the Western zone of the large market where wildlife was sold and 2 from other parts of the market, were positive for SARS-CoV-2 [39] . However, of the 31 positive samples, only 14 were derived from the wildlife-trading shops, whereas 19 positive samples were collected from other kinds of shops (https://3w.huanqiu.com/a/24d596/9CaKrnKp4T3?agt=8, accessed on 27 August 2021). Currently, it is unknown how the virus can be transferred directly from animal species to humans in the seafood market and how the virus could be spread among diverse foods in this market. This suggested that there may be animals that freely contact all kinds of foods and spread the virus everywhere in the market.",

            "text": "Mice and humans have large-scale synteny across over 90% of their genomes but have a much lower extent of sequence orthology covering less than half of the two genomes [44] . Therefore, there are significant differences between the two species, especially within each of their MHC (major histocompatibility complex) genomic regions [45] . In this study, we calculated the binding affinity of the two virus spike proteins with human/mouse MHCs to deduce the allergenicity of the viruses, based on the danger theory [18, 46] and the MHC restriction phenomenon [15, 16, 47, 48] . Our results show that five human HLA class I alleles and nine human HLA class II alleles can bind tightly with the S protein fragments of SARS-CoV-2, accounting for 0.18% to 24.28% of the sampled Chinese populations ( Table 1 ). Provided that the locus recombination frequencies of 2%-3% are negligible [49] , the proportion of infection-susceptible individuals would be about 7.36% of the Chinese population. These data suggest that people who have these HLA genotypes would be severely affected by COVID-19 and develop obvious pathological symptoms if there were no intervention. The rate of refractory patients calculated from the epidemic data from 14 February to 21 March 2020 in China was 24.7% of the hospitalized patients (about 0.5% of whole Wuhan population), obviously different from the estimated value of 7.36% of the whole population. The discrepancy may result from the powerful non-medical and medical interventions that were implemented to control COVID-19 in China. By contrast, the remaining 92.64% of the population would be healthy without severe symptoms even if they were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Under all kinds of intervention, the proportion of asymptomatic population and paucisymptomatic cases would be much higher than 92.64%, as estimated by different researchers at different times to be 39.9-50.5% [50] , 59% [51] , or 90% [52] in the Chinese population. Taken together, specific patients who have been infected by SARS-Cov-2 may not have obvious symptoms, making prevention of COVID-19 incredibly challenging. The phenotypic frequencies in different countries are expected to be somewhat different. For example, the rate of refractory virus-susceptible individuals was estimated to be 4.78% of the American population without any interventions (Table 1) .",

            "text": "According to sequence alignment with other SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 has an unusual insert of 10 amino acids (HVSGTNGTKR) in the N-terminal domain (Figure 3 ). This insert is aligned specifically to RaTK15, a SARS-like coronavirus reported to originate from bats Rhinolophus affinis (but not Rhinolophus sinicus), with 96.2% identity at the whole-genome level to SARS-CoV-2 [2] . No other animals have been reported with a higher sequence identity with the SARS-CoV-2. Ge et al. strongly suggested that Chinese horseshoe bats were the natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs [53] . It is notable that Chinese horseshoe bats, R. sinicus and R. affinis, have a similar appearance, and R. affinis is the main variety of bat in the Hubei Province. Nevertheless, no SARS-CoV-like virus has been identified from the Hubei R. affinis bats, but from the bats R. macrotis and R. ferrumequinum, in which no viruses had been isolated by culture with Vero E6 cells from fecal swabs of the PCR-positive samples [54] . In addition, R. pearsoni bats are indigenous across the Yunnan province, China and Southeast Asia, and were suggested to harbor coronaviruses closely related to SARS that infected the human population [54] . The study [2] on viral infectivity into HeLa cells with or without the expressions of ACE2 proteins from human, Chinese horseshoe bats (R. sinicus, not R. affinis), civets, pigs, and mouses concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could use all but mouse ACE2 as an entry receptor in the ACE2-expressing cells; that is to say, the mouse ACE2 would not facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry to mouse cells. This conclusion may be doubtful based on the homology analysis performed on ACE2. The alignment result indicated that the identity of ACE2 amino acid sequences between human and mice (Mus musculus) or rats (Rattus norvegicus) are 81.05% to 82.49% (Figure 7 and Table 2 ), respectively, which exceeds the threshold of greater than 70% sequence identities usually required to trigger cross-reactivity between proteins [55] . This empirical law supports that mouse ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In fact, a previous study reported that SARS-CoVs can proliferate in the mouse without severe symptoms [56] . Even if the above mouse ACE2 assays [2] were correct, an alternative route involving the CD147-spike protein would also help SARS-CoV-2 to invade host cells [57] , further explaining the above conflicting results and supporting the rodents as a potential intermediate reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. That is to say, viral proliferation in rodents can be maintained without symptoms because MHC alleles in rodents have no ultrahigh binding affinity to proteins from SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV (data not shown). It is therefore tempting to deduce that the mouse could be a long-term host of human SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, according to our previous analysis, after a cross-species jump in 1991 and a human-adapted strain formed in 1998, SARS-CoV may still exist in humans (https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2659, accessed on 27 August 2021). Therefore, the entry receptor ACE2 is not a problem for the coronavirus to attack humans from then on, no matter whether RaTK15 was isolated from R. pearsoni, R. sinicus, or R. affinis. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus. It possesses a large RNA genome and undergoes RNA recombination, as in other coronaviruses, at a high frequency of nearly 25% for the entire genome [58] , thus driving frequent speciestransmission adaptation. Another report suggested that SARS-CoVs were likely caused by mutations and natural selection in addition to recombination [59] . Moreover, an average female rodent gives birth approximately seven times per year, which would lead to much a higher rate of mutations of the viruses maintained, compared to a deduced general mutation rate of 0.80~2.38 \u00d7 10 \u22123 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for SARS-CoV [60] . Furthermore, during the August through November period in 2019, the most serious drought and highest temperatures in the summer and autumn time frame were experienced in Wuhan in the past 68 years (Figure 6 ). This climate could have provided favorable conditions for virus mutation from a mild form to the highly virulent SARS-CoV-2. Based on the causality triangle of viruses, hosts and environmental conditions, even if the nucleotide fragments of an intermediate host were integrated into the virus, those fragments could not easily be detected because of RNA recombination. Since cross-species transmissibility depends on protein functions, the amino acid sequences of the virus can provide compelling evidence to support identification of intermediate hosts.",

            "text": "Interestingly, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are inherently capable of reacting with different allelic forms of HLA molecules and tightly binding dozens of different HLA molecules. This means that these two viruses would have similar allergenicity and would trigger similar pathophysiological insults in humans. This is supported by autopsy and biopsies of cadavers of patients who died from SARS-CoV-2, because the pathological characteristics of COVID-19 strongly resemble those seen in SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infections [61] [62] [63] . However, the cytokine-based endotypes of critically ill COVID-19 patients who are insensitive to treatment with steroids because of an increased concentration of the highly proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A produced by CCR4 + CCR6 + Th17 in CD4 + T cells [63, 64] would be quite different from those of SARS patients for whom steroid treatment is beneficial because of the increased presence of type 2 cytokines [65, 66] . Therefore, clinical treatments for SARS-CoV-2 patients will be different from those employed on SARS patients. On the other hand, unlike human HLA, mouse MHC does not bind strongly to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that there would be no symptoms when rodents become infected with this virus. In fact, although SARS-CoV can replicate in the lungs of young mice following infection, such mice do not harbor replicated SARS-CoV in both lung and intestinal tissue and they do not show signs of illness. These mice present either subclinical infection or very mild disease after simultaneous inoculation intranasally and orally [56, 67] . Therefore, it is likely that these rodents would not become ill in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they harbored this virus. This situation provides conditions for the spread of the virus in humans and the rodents until herd immunity develops in the two populations. This is corroborated by our previous research data showing that SARS-CoV may still exist in humans (https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2659, accessed on 27 August 2021).",

The virus would be maintained in general populations who have no high binding-affinity HLA alleles and be transferred between individuals. As described above, more than 92.64% of the population harbors the virus with no obvious symptoms, meaning that many people will be SARS-CoV-2 positive as detected by nucleic acid testing. We have demonstrated that weakly virulent SARS-CoVs might still exist in humans for years (https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2659, accessed on 27 August 2021). These existing SARS-CoVs have significant potential to evolve into highly virulent strains when favorable meteorological conditions occur, highlighting the potential risk for reemergence of SARS as well. Based on the mutation rate of coronavirus and meteorological extremes occurring because of climate change, we speculate that SARS could re-emerge in the near future in a new form. A SARS vaccine is therefore urgently needed. However, a SARS-like chimeric virus experiment demonstrated that both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches and prophylactic modalities failed to neutralize and protect from infection by those CoVs that possess a novel spike protein [68] . Advanced strategies and regimens will need to be developed. For example, a novel vaccine against a pool of the most highly virulent mutant strains could be prepared in advance. Hypothesis 1. Self-limitation and spontaneous mutation within the virus-infected population.",

When a virus mutates into a novel one and severely infects one (or several) group(s) of individuals with specific MHC genotype(s), these susceptible individuals either die or heal with the development of immunity. The vast majority of individuals who range from being paucisymptomatic to asymptomatic or having recovered from the disease still harbor the novel virus while it is spread within the population with no epidemic. When conditions favor mutations, the virus becomes more virulent and targets individuals harboring other type(s) of MHC genotype(s), leading to soaring infection numbers and another epidemic. A new cycle would therefore start within the population. When the virus has acquired mutations favoring a cross-species jump, increasing infection numbers would lead to an epidemic followed by asymptomatic transmission within the new species into which the virus has jumped. This phenomenon will occur in many different mammals including humans, bats, rodents, etc. Furthermore, when the virus accumulates the requisite mutations enabling interspecies transmission and binding of all MHC alleles among another species population with high affinity, a much deadlier super virus could emerge to eradicate the species. The only way to defend against such a super virus is to employ prophylactic modalities, such as early immunization with a hypoallergenic virus that has been gradually attenuated from the super virus, as exemplified by the incidence of smallpox versus cowpox.",

            "text": "In summary, our results indicate that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are naturally originated from bats and might be transmitted to humans through rodents. This was demonstrated by carrying out comprehensive amino acid sequence analysis and comparison of sliding sequence fragments of the novel virus with all sequences from mammals available in the NCBI database. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have similar binding affinities to the HLA antigen and would have similar potential to induce inflammation. Different populations have distinct allele distribution patterns and thus variable infection rates. It is predicted that the virus will severely infect 4.78% to 7.36% of the American and Chinese populations, respectively, and would make them suffer severe symptoms. Meteorological factor analysis indicates that Wuhan 2019 and Guangdong 2002-2003 have similar climate features, with extremely high temperatures and exceptionally low precipitation, which might imply some link between the climate environment and the survival and development of the coronaviruses. Early immunization with allergenically-engineered virus together with a continued surveillance of meteorological factors and viral mutations may serve as one of the most powerful prophylactic modalities to fight this virus.",

The percentage of high affinity peptides is calculated as total high affinity peptides divided by total peptides that the spike protein harbors and the specific HLA molecule can bind, multiplied by 100. Affinity 0.9 (HLA Class I) and affinity 0.8 (HLA Class II), the top affinities of the panallergen profilin Q64LH0, were defined as the ultrahigh affinity cutoff values.

The percentage of individuals that have the alleles in the sampled subpopulations was calculated based on sample sizes and allele frequencies. According to the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, the number (Ni) of individuals that have the allele in the total of the sampled i subpopulation was roughly calculated based on the sample sizes (Si) and allele frequencies (Qi) through the following formula. The larger the subpopulation, the more accurate the Ni result.",
