Over half (54%) of participants reported worsened loneliness due to COVID-19, which was associated with worsened depression (62% versus 9%, p<0.001) and anxiety (57% versus 9%, p<0.001). Rates of loneliness improved on average by time since shelter-in-place orders (4-6 weeks: 46% versus 13-15 weeks: 27%, p=0.009), however, loneliness persisted or worsened for a subgroup of participants.

While these orders have been credited with reducing the spread of COVID-19, it is unclear whether such orders have had unintended consequences for older adults who may be uniquely vulnerable to experiencing social isolation and loneliness, two distinct markers of social well-being. 1, 2 Social isolation is an objective deficit in the number of relationships with and frequency of contact with family, friends, and the community. 3 By definition, shelter-in-place orders have isolated older adults to their homes, and this isolation might be greater for individuals who struggle to navigate video-and internet-based social interaction. While social isolation may not be emotionally distressing for all, it is associated with medical risks, increased health care costs, and limited access to key caregiver, financial, medical, or emotional support during the pandemic. [4] [5] [6] [7] In contrast, loneliness is a discrepancy between one's actual and desired level of social connection, and is associated with depression, anxiety, functional disability, and physical symptoms such as pain, and death. 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 During the COVID-19 pandemic, many older adults may have experienced new or worsened feelings of loneliness due to a disruption of in-person social activities, which are often essential due to pre-existing limitations from chronic medical conditions, vision or hearing impairment, or functional disability. 1 Social isolation and loneliness can exist separately, and it is not uncommon for them to co-exist.",

Moreover, a recent National Academy of Sciences report highlighted the need for clinicians to be aware of and actively address the health effects of social isolation and loneliness. 10 We therefore conducted a mixed-methods study of community-dwelling older adults primarily in the San Francisco and Bay Area during shelter-in-place orders. Our objectives were to 1) investigate experiences of social isolation and loneliness during shelter-in-place orders, and 2) examine unmet health needs related to changes in social interactions.",

Several measures of social connections were included based on standard scales or adapted to measure social experiences during the coronavirus pandemic (Supplementary Table 1 ). We used a modified Duke Social Support Index social interaction sub-scale. 11, 12 The six-item scale includes the number of local contacts the participant feels close to or can depend on, the frequency of participation in community activities in the past week, and the frequency of social interaction (excluding interactions with co-residents) via telephone, video, internet, or inperson communication, for a total range of 0-17 points. We categorized individuals as socially isolated if scoring \u22646 points on the 17-point scale, which represents minimal support or interaction from all sources. 13, 14 Given the lack of consensus on an appropriate cut-off for social isolation, especially during the pandemic, we conducted sensitivity analyses of the social interaction scale both as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable with higher or lower cutoffs which yielded similar results (results available on request). In addition, we measured the frequency of communication with different social relationships (children or family, friends or neighbors, or volunteers).",

For qualitative analysis, all comments were reviewed using open coding in which themes that emerged repeatedly in the data were defined and saved as codes. After a set of preliminary codes was created, free-text comments were then reviewed by each coder (AK and RN) and a constant comparative approach was used to finalize codes fitting concepts suggested by the data.

It may be reasonable to scale interventions for immediate health needs while concurrently developing the evidence base. For example, anecdotally, during the course of study interviews, research staff found participants wanted to discuss their social experiences, as this in-and-of-itself was therapeutic. Brief phone calls or inquiries about social isolation and loneliness during the pandemic may be feasible for primary care offices or community organizations and are often welcomed by older adults. 10 In addition, we suggest medical and health providers establish partnerships and referral networks to allow for \"social prescribing\" to local community-based support programs. 10, 34, 35 Lastly, our study demonstrates that technology can be a powerful tool to help adults connect during periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, over-reliance on technologies can heighten or accentuate digital and socioeconomic divides. Before moving forward with technology-based interventions during the pandemic, it is important to assess who the interventions aim to serve, who may be left out, and how to address these gaps.",

Technology-based interactions have been widely assumed to alleviate forced isolation from shelter-in-place orders; however, nearly three quarters of study participants reported minimal or no video-and/or internet-based socializing with friends and family. In addition, over half of participants reported heightened loneliness attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Loneliness was strongly associated with concurrent worsening of depression, anxiety, worries about coronavirus, and worries about their general health. Results indicate that overall there was stability or improvement in loneliness over time suggesting resilience and an ability to adapt among many older adults. However, a notable subgroup experienced persistent or worsened loneliness over time. Open-ended feedback revealed challenges this subgroup of older adults may be experiencing with emotional coping.Moreover, comfort with and access to technology was often central to an ability to cope with restrictions, maintain social connections, or find help with medical needs. Taken together, results suggest that identifying those experiencing persistent loneliness or with barriers to technologybased social interaction may be critical to addressing psychological suffering and unmet medical needs during the pandemic.Nearly 4 in 5 older adults had minimal video interaction and 2 in 5 had infrequent internet-based socializing with friends and family, which contributed to high rates of social Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright.
