From an international research effort that includes the United States and the European Union, (Bertsimas, and others, 2020) a method of mortality risk assessment was developed from XGB-based classifiers, clinical and laboratory predictors. Among the critical risk factors, age, reduced oxygen saturation, high levels of PCRhs, as well as the presence of creatinine, urea nitrogen and blood glucose were found. In the case study, an enveloping feature selector was employed, and unlike the studies cited, the role of regional data was emphasized.",

The algorithm then combines the values of the artificial predictors before running the classifier for the extended system. From a statistical test, Boruta compares the value of the most relevant artificial variable with the original ones. All original variables that result in values of importance greater than those of artificial variables are considered relevant. Due to the random nature of the variables that are combined, additional iterations of the above process can result in different characteristics.

In this context, Sharma(Sharma, 2020) trains convolutional neural networks (NNBs) from images from healthy people (618) and infected with influenza (175), pneumonia (224) and COVID-19 viruses to predict the results of the qRT-PCR test of pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scans. Similarly, Mei et al. (Mei, et al., 2020) explore alternatives to the qRT-PCR test by using AI techniques for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 using data from Computed Tomography (CT), clinical symptoms, exposure history, and patient laboratory tests. They then employ a hybrid technique that makes use of machine learning methods such as Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Vector Support Machines (SVM) as classifiers.",

Approximately 18 common symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection were identified, in order of prevalence: Fever, headache, odynophagia, attack on the general condition (adinamia), myalgia, arthralgia, prostration, rhinorrhea, chills, abdominal pain, conjunctivitis, dyspnea, cyanosis, chest pain, polypnea, coryza, anosmia, dysgeusia, among others. The risk factors found by the algorithm, which increase lethality, are related to the pre-existence of pathologies such as: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Diabetes, Hypertension, Immunosuppression, Smoking, Obesity, Cardiovascular Disease, Kidney Failure, Neurological Disease, Pneumonia and Tuberculosis. Regarding the treatment received, immunization through the influenza vaccine close to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, increases the risk of lethality, so it is suggested to evaluate the existence of a possible interference in the immune response to the coronavirus for the development of complications from infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the adult population.
