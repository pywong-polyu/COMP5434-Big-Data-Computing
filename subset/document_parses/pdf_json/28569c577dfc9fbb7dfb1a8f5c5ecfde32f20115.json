Many modifications have been made to this basic framework, usually involving further subdivision of the disease classifications to reflect either more complex pathogen biology (e.g., waning immunity, fatal infection, or the presence of a latent period), multiple pathogens [e.g., canine distemper and sarcoptic mange in fishers (Martes pennanti); Keller et al. 2012 ], multiple hosts [e.g., louping ill virus in red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica), mountain hare (Lepus timidus), and red deer (Cervus elaphus); Gilbert et al. 2001] , or greater structure within the host population (e.g., age, sex, or social status). These modifications include the susceptibleinfectious (SI) and susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) models, among others. For structured host populations, differences in contact rates between different subgroups often become important, replacing the single parameter \u03b2 with a matrix that describes the transmission of infection between and within different groups.

Two of the most important quantities in epidemiology emerged from such analyses. The first, R 0 , defines the average number of secondary cases that would arise from an average primary case in an entirely susceptible population. The exact formulation of this variable depends on the type of model used (i.e., SIR versus SEIR); however, for the SIR model described above, it is given by R 0 \u00bc \u03b2 \u03b3\u00fe\u03bc . The force of infection, \u03bb, on the other hand, defines the per capita rate at which susceptible individuals contract the infection, and is equal to \u03b2I and \u03b2Y/N, for the proportions and number of individuals formulations, respectively. The values that these quantities take in different host-pathogen systems can determine the final outcome of the disease (e.g., R 0 must be greater than unity for a disease to spread and less than unity to ensure eventual disease eradication; Keeling and Eames 2005; Keeling and Rohani 2008; Kawata 2010) . Anderson et al. (1981) , for example, used a compartmental model to demonstrate that vaccinating at random at least a proportion p \u00bc 1 \u00c0 1/R 0 of the population ensures the eventual eradication of rabies from foxes. Although numerous methods have been devised to improve the calculation of this value (e.g., incorporating age or transmission heterogeneity), the original formulation remains one of the most fundamental and often-used discoveries in epidemiology (Keeling et al. 2003; Garnett 2005; Yip et al. 2007 ). Multi-host models, on the other hand, have been used to investigate the effects of multiple hosts on maintaining infections in situations where a single host is insufficient to sustain the ongoing spread of the disease (e.g., Dobson and Meagher 1996; Gilbert et al. 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 193, "text": "(Smith and Cheeseman 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 194, "end": 218, "text": "Keeling and Rohani 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1120, "text": "Keeling and Eames 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1145, "text": "Keeling and Rohani 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1158, "text": "Kawata 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1183, "text": "Anderson et al.

While this framework, which yields the familiar \u03b2SI transmission term, has been applied with some success, certain populations may not display such a characteristic. For a sexually transmitted disease in humans, for example, the number of transmissible contacts (i.e., sexual partners) is often independent of population density (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2004; Ryder et al. 2007 ). In these situations, a frequency-dependent rate of transmission is required, which alters the transmission term to \u03b2SI/N (McCallum et al. 2001; Begon et al. 2002; Keeling and Rohani 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 677, "end": 702, "text": "(Lloyd-Smith et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 703, "end": 720, "text": "Ryder et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 845, "end": 867, "text": "(McCallum et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 868, "end": 886, "text": "Begon et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 887, "end": 911, "text": "Keeling and Rohani 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Uses and Limitations"}, {"text": "Although these examples may give the impression that transmission operates only at two extremes (i.e., either independent or as a function of host density), in most situations, it is in fact a continuum of values and may even change throughout the course of an epidemic.

Because the exact formulation of the transmission term is crucial to a model's predictive and descriptive capabilities, as well as the qualitative behavior of the system itself, the relationship of contact rates to density is still an area of active research. In general, however, frequency-dependent transmission is used primarily in models of vector-borne pathogens and human populations, while density-dependent transmission is generally considered to be more applicable to plant and animal diseases (McCallum et al. 2001; Begon et al. 2002; Keeling and Rohani 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 271, "end": 295, "text": "Antonovics et al.

An additional source of seasonality that is almost exclusive to wildlife populations arises from birth pulses which recruit a large number of susceptible individuals into the population at approximately the same time each year (Gremillion- Smith and Woolf 1988; Keeling and Rohani 2008) .

(1981) , who developed a deterministic SEI (susceptible-exposed-infectious) model for the fatal rabies virus in European red foxes (Vulpes vulpes; Kawata 2010) . This model demonstrated that the latent period of rabies could act as a time-delayed density-dependent regulator of fox population growth and result in the 4-year oscillations in population size and disease prevalence observed in fox populations throughout Europe. The authors also concluded that culling alone was unlikely to be effective once rabies becomes established within a fox population. Vaccination, on the other hand, significantly increased the odds of disease eradication, especially when combined with culling in regions with low fox density (Anderson et al. 1981) . Gilbert et al. (2001) used a multi-host approach to investigate how the persistence of a tick-borne virus (louping ill virus) is affected by the presence of grouse, hare, and deer in upland Britain. This model demonstrated that neither deer nor grouse alone could sustain such a virus, but that the combination of the two could and that the inclusion of hare into this system greatly increased the likelihood of virus persistence (Gilbert et al. 2001 ). These results were later used by Laurenson et al. (2003) to investigate whether decreasing hare density could be used as a strategy to decrease virus prevalence in grouse. They discovered that not only would this strategy decrease infections in grouse, but it would also increase their fecundity as a consequence of increased life expectancy. The authors concluded that mountain hares serve as a reservoir species that can maintain the virus as long as hare density remains above five individuals km \u00c02 . Packer et al. (2003) used a simple compartmental SI model to demonstrate a very interesting principle-that predator control programs aimed at increasing prey abundance could prove harmful to prey populations that are regulated by infectious diseases rather than by predation. The authors showed that because infected prey live longer in the absence of predators, they are able to infect many more susceptible animals than they would be able to otherwise. Although this effect is more pronounced when predators selectively remove infected prey (e.g., if the infection makes prey easier to capture or locate), nonselective predation is still beneficial to host populations by reducing the life span of infectious individuals. This principle was used to retroactively explain how the introduction of private gamekeepers (who removed predators) in red grouse habitats destabilized the grouse population in North Yorkshire, England (Packer et al. 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 121, "end": 143, "text": "Anderson et al.

Wind-and vectorborne transmission models, for example, assume that subpopulations are epidemiologically sessile, forcing coupling (i.e., the strength of transmission) to decrease with distance. These models have been used extensively to model the spatial dynamics of livestock diseases by treating each farm as a sessile subpopulation (e.g., Ferguson et al. 2001; Keeling 2001) . Commuter models, which are most commonly used for human population, are instead based on the premise that permanent relocation between subpopulations is rare but temporary travel between them is sufficient for disease spread (Keeling and Rohani 2008) .

Although many modeling studies have concluded that persistence increases with the intergroup connectivity, Jesse et al. (2008) demonstrated that the relationship is strongly nonlinear. More specifically, a peak in epidemic duration appears at small movement rates (due to asynchrony in the disease dynamics between subpopulations), followed by a global maximum at larger rates (when the pathogen \"perceives\" the metapopulation as a single well-mixed population). These results are particularly applicable to outbreak management because they demonstrated that while restricting animal movement (a common response to disease outbreaks in cattle farms) will reduce the total number of subpopulations that experience infection, it may also prolong epidemic duration instead of decreasing it. At these lower movement rates, any infectious animal that does move between subpopulations has a large probability of encountering a fully susceptible subpopulation, thereby preventing the disease from dying out for an increased length of time (similar to the rescue effect in ecology). Another important conclusion is that although increasing mixing between subpopulations via habitat corridors is an effective means of species conservation (Hanski 1999) , their potential as conduits for the spread of infectious diseases should be carefully considered before implementation (Hess 1994 (Hess , 1996 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 246, "end": 267, "text": "(Swinton et al. 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 268, "end": 288, "text": "Fulford et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 289, "end": 313, "text": "Keeling and Rohani 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 423, "end": 442, "text": "Jesse et al.

An alternative approach, originally proposed by Levins (1969) , models each subpopulation as being either pathologically empty (disease-free) or occupied (having infection).

Unlike the old diet that required long-distance foraging and migration, the new one required minimal migration, which decreased the connectivity between subpopulations (identified by the location of their daytime roosts). By incorporating data on within-and between-camp transmission, the authors demonstrated that the decreased migration led to increased epidemic sizes and divergence in both amplitude and frequency from epidemics in rural camps. This was due to the fact that as fewer individuals migrated, the probability of infected hosts moving between camps decreased, which lowered the probability of camps becoming reinfected after local viral extinction and increased the time over which subpopulations could recruit susceptible individuals via births. This resulting decline in herd immunity across the metapopulation shifted disease dynamics toward sporadic, shorter, and more intense local epidemics with larger numbers of infected individuals. However, if this connectivity were to drop below a certain threshold level, then the resulting movement would become insufficient to reinfect distant camps.

As ongoing advances in GPS and proximity sensor technology make it more feasible to capture the level of data required to more accurately parameterize contact structure, network modeling will continue to provide useful insights into infectious diseases of wild animals (Keeling and Eames 2005; Tompkins et al. 2011; Godfrey 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 445, "end": 470, "text": "(Keeling and Rohani 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 471, "end": 483, "text": "Kawata 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 876, "end": 900, "text": "(Keeling and Eames 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 901, "end": 922, "text": "Tompkins et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 923, "end": 936, "text": "Godfrey 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Although much research has evaluated the uses, limitations, and dynamics of different infectious disease models, many potential avenues for future research still exist for each one.
