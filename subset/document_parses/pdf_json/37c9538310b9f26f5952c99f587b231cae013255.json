Optimal design criteria for face shield use in healthcare environments are limited. We attempt to identify factors affecting face shield usability and to test and optimize a face shield for comfort and function in health care settings. Methods: A broad range of workers in a large health care system were surveyed regarding face shield features and usability. Quantitative and qualitative analysis informed the development of iterative prototypes which were tested against existing shields. Iterative testing and redesign utilized expert insight and feedback from participant focus groups to inform subsequent prototype designs. Results: From 1,648 responses, 6 key elements were identified: ability to adjust tension, shifting load bearing from the temples, anti-fogging, ventilation, freedom of movement, and durability. Iterative prototypes received consistently excellent feedback based on use in the clinical environment, demonstrating incremental improvement. Conclusion: We defined elements of face shield design necessary for usability in health care and produced a highly functional face shield that satisfies frontline provider criteria and Emergency Use Authorization standards set by the Food and Drug Administration. Integrating human factors principles into rapid-cycle prototyping for personal protective equipment is feasible and valuable.",

These disruptions affected 35% of manufacturers and coalesced with a massive spike in PPE usage by HCP to create a shortage of PPE. 7 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on the use of improvised PPE due to inadequate output from traditional production lines. 8 At that time, the abrupt paucity of PPE had necessitated ingenuity for the generation of alternative supply chains that rapidly manufacture unregulated and untested products. 2 The widespread dissemination of information using social media at the time facilitated a \"citizen supply chain\", comprised of community volunteers who use their personal 3D printers to fabricate face shield parts using templates downloaded from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3D Printing Service. 9, 10 Many designs from around the world were and are freely accessible from the NIH to users who can independently produce and assemble completed face shields at a low cost with minimal labor [https://3dprint.nih.gov/].",

However, it is likely that the increased virulence of variants of SARS-CoV-2, and the experience of living within a pandemic will result in new perceptions by health care organizations about the importance of PPE. For example, individuals may feel more comfortable wearing masks or face shields as part of normal work, rather than for specific clinical tasks. In addition, face shields will continue to be used for protection during procedures and at other points in clinical care. Therefore, the need to design a face shield to promote comfort and wearability remains, even once the pandemic has further abated.",

[13] [14] [15] COVID-19 cases correlate inversely with PPE compliance, demonstrating the need to ensure the usability of face shields for the health of HCP and thus reduce the risk of exposure. 16 A systematic approach to PPE for infectious disease should entail multidisciplinary assessment of PPE based on exposure risk, job hazard analysis, proper PPE selection, and evaluation of selected PPE to optimize usability and protection. 15 Even after the implementation of a design, it is important to iteratively re-evaluate in order to understand where possible redesigns are needed. 16 The field of human factors is concerned with understanding how human cognitive, physical, and interpersonal capabilities and limitations influence how humans work, with the ultimate goal of designing the work to fit the human (rather than vice versa). 17 In this case, we are particularly curious how to design face shields that will be comfortable enough to be worn for extended periods of time for users with different craniofacial structures, those with glasses and without, and those that engage in rigorous physical movement during their job.",

In the longer term, our team realized that there are opportunities to design health care PPE with the same rigor that other high-risk industries (eg, welding or manufacturing) do, with a design that promotes comfort and decreases workplace injuries/exposures. To our knowledge, there is not a rigorous study that has developed specific criteria to inform face shield redesign based on HCP-reported usability in the clinical context. In this project, our goal was to determine usability issues that frontline HCP experience with current face shields and to develop design criteria for a prototype. Using this data, we developed a prototype and, via randomized testing, iteratively tested and updated our design. Our goal was to use this human-centered design approach to maximize face shield comfort, use, perceptions of safety, and intention to wear throughout a shift.",

Our data identified 6 specific face shield design criteria that were informed by the input of a diverse group of HCP in a large health care system (Table 4 ). These 6 criteria serve 2 important functions. First, they concisely convey the chief concerns confronted by HCP in the clinical context, which allows for iterative input and redesign based on empiric feedback from those staff that uses the face shields. Second, through a partnership with engineers, this information and 3 rounds of iterative testing allowed the development of freely accessible face shield designs with progressive improvement. Unsurprisingly, previous research during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that HCPs prefer face shield designs that are optimized with user feedback. 20, 21 The reduction in dissatisfaction of market-available face shields seen in Figure 1 illustrates the importance of feedback and iterative design. Issues of heat, visibility, problems with glasses, and fogging were essentially eliminated. The issues experienced by providers changed over time and with newer iterations of the face shield. Issues of glare, difficulty communicating, marks on face and headache were never fully resolved. However, the statement that participants would leave the face shield on for the duration of a shift suggests that perhaps the baseline on which discomfort was being described may have shifted.",
