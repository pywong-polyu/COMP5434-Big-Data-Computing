Data from FAIR Health's FH\u00ae NPIC (National Private Insurance Claims) database, one of the nation's largest databases of private insurance claim records, were analyzed to understand the experiences of individuals with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that individuals with ASD + ID were nine times more likely to be hospitalized following COVID-19 infection (OR = 9.3; 95% CI: 6.9-12.5) and were nearly six times more likely to have an elevated length of hospital stay (OR = 5.9; 95% CI: 3.5-10.1) compared to those without ASD + ID. These findings point to the need for prioritizing access to vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infection and morbidities. This is the first study to illustrate a higher likelihood of hospitalization and elevated length of hospital stay from COVID-19 in individuals with ASD and other comorbidities.",

A study of individuals with ASD in Germany illustrated that the COVID-19 pandemic increased ASD-related behavioral difficulties, reduced sleep quality, and increased hypersensitivity (Mutluer et al., 2020) . People with ASD also had difficulty understanding the need for social distancing and staying at home, consistently using personal protective equipment (e.g., masks, gloves, etc.). Further, their caregivers did not have access to resources to educate their child with ASD about COVID-19 and ways to prevent infections. Finally, the study illustrated that increases in ASD-related behavioral challenges were correlated with the severity of anxiety in parents and caregivers. Similarly, another study from Northern Italy showed an exacerbation of pre-existing behavioral challenges in individuals with ASD, and parent-reported challenges in managing free time and structured activities during the COVID-19 pandemic (Colizzi et al., 2020) . Children with ASD that did not receive services from schools experienced more intense behavioral problems.",

While a lower proportion of individuals with ASD acquired COVID-19 infection than other condition groups, they were significantly more likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 and have a longer length of stay in the hospital. Contrastingly, individuals with other chronic conditions had a higher prevalence of COVID-19 infections (e.g., Heart Failure, Obesity, Diabetes) had lower adjusted odds of hospitalization and elevated length of hospital stay. Underlying demographic patterns likely drive a lower overall prevalence of COVID-19 in ASD. A closer examination of the demographic distribution indicates that more than 90% of individuals with ASD were in the younger age range (i.e., less than 30 years old). Nearly 70% belonged to the 0-18-year-old group. As a result, most individuals with ASD in the data are likely living with their families during the pandemic, limiting their exposure compared to individuals in congregate living environments. A substantial increase in morbidity and Fig. 3 Likelihood of higher than median length of stay in hospital from COVID-19 infection mortality in COVID-19 among individuals with disabilities, especially among individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, has been associated with their living situation in congregate care settings . Once individuals with ASD acquire COVID-19 infection, the regression models indicate a higher likelihood of hospitalization and elevated length of hospital stay. While Cunningham et al. (2020) described a similar pattern of lower COVID-19 prevalence and higher morbidity among young individuals using electronic medical records data, the quantitative differences in the likelihood of hospitalization and duration of stay for individuals with ASD is concerning and requires attention (Cunningham et al., 2020) . Individuals with ASD, in general, have higher medical needs resulting from cooccurring mental health and other conditions such as epilepsy, digestive disorders, etc. (Karpur et al., 2018; Shea et al., 2018) . It is possible that the COVID-19 infection, irrespective of severity, precipitates behavior health challenges leading to hospitalization and longer duration of stay (Bal et al., 2021; Righi et al., 2017; White et al., 2021) . Further, several immunological theories, including the more recent preposition of abnormal melatonin production among individuals with ASD, might contribute to the increased severity of COVID-19 infection (Brown et al., 2021) .",

However, given the challenges in consistently implementing social distancing practices and PPEs among individuals with ASD, it would be helpful to include them as one of the high-risk populations for immunizations.",

Medicaid funds healthcare and long-term services and supports such as congregate or community-based housing for people with ASD or other developmental disabilities. Future studies should explore hospitalization and length of stay because of COVID-19 for people with ASD who have Medicaid. Secondly, the findings are based on claims data that trigger a record upon receipt of services, and the data capture events only through September 2020. The prevalence of COVID-19 infection may be much higher than is reported here in the analysis, and it indeed increased as infections increased in late fall/early winter. An additional limitation is that condition identification was based on the ICD-10 diagnostic codes that may miss some individuals. The claims data are also limited in attributing events of hospitalization resulting from key symptoms or complications of COVID-19.",

Factors that indicate social and economic vulnerability, including living situation, would likely present more nuanced and policy-relevant findings. Future studies that employ natural language processing or medical record review to identify COVID-19, people with ASD, and other important factors related to hospitalization and length of stay would help extend the present work and further characterizing the impact of COVID-19 on the ASD population.",
