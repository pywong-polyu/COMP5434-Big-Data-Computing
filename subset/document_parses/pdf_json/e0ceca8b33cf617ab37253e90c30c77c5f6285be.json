National public health issues and healthcare disparities continue and have created a global concern for providing evidence-based, adequate pain management in the dental setting. We have brought together a group of national thought leaders and experts in this field who will share their insights on the current state of opioid prescribing in Dentistry and describe some of the exciting work being done in advancing pain management.",

The 2011 Report of the US National Research Council, \"Towards Precision Medicine: Building a Knowledge Network for Biomedical Research and a New Taxonomy of Disease\" set the intellectual foundation that subsequently became a funded US initiative as identified in President Obama's 2015 State of the Union Address. 1 This initiative -an extension of the Human Genome Project -should be understood as the path towards better health and health outcomes, with significant investments in infrastructure and standards comparable to the US initiative to create a national highway system. 2 Clinicians will slowly depart from determining interventions based on average response rates established by means of clinical trials alone, to querying huge data lakes, representing millions of people to pair each patient with a personal matched treatment with minimized adverse reactions. This type of practice is increasingly referred to as \"big data medicine\", as it captures, analyzes and suggests actions using data science tools based on a wide range of genomic, molecular, cellular, physiological, clinical, behavioral, social, lifestyle and environmental parameters applicable to an individual person. In-office acquired health data will increasingly be complemented by information obtained from a host of wearable digital sensors that are interfaced with the electronic personal health record (ePHR), accessible to a growingly accountable and incentivized patient, and appropriately digested by the electronic health record owned by the respective health network system (n-EHR).",

For these health conditions -cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory diseases, and chronic pain conditions -single genetic variants do not account for much of their heritability. 3 These complex, non-communicable diseases often co-occur in the same individual, raising the question of whether the siloed, fragmented health care delivery system and existing disease taxonomies have exhausted their utility to support the best use of the accumulated science when applied to patients. The inadequacy of the US healthcare system is further put in question by established shortfalls in health outcomes, high costs for care, health inequities, well-established structural inefficiencies, missed opportunities, waste and fraud, and finally, harm to patients, calling for greater accountability, efficient learning from past mistakes and strong incentives for shaving costs but not quality of care. 4 By adopting this new transformational thinking of precision medicine or big data medicine, the choice of care should be determined by learning from successfully treated patients that exhibit the closest \"biomarker\" match with the person of concern, not only informing the clinician of the best therapeutic choice for a given patient, but also avoiding harmful and costly treatment complications.",

However, structural challenges inherent in the current care delivery system combined with professional reluctance are obvious when considering practical management issues as persistent orofacial pain conditionsmore likely than not -are associated with a host of comorbid ailments often beyond the scope of practice of the dental practitioner. Limitations imposed by historic scope of US State practice laws combined with the absence of fully integrated health information exchanges including medical, behavioral and dental health data by means of a shared electronic health record poses an insurmountable climb at this time. Another concern is the fact that the next generation of precision medicine-enabling taxonomies are based on fundamental knowledge of diseases assembled in network clusters that do not recognize anatomically-defined practice domains, as opposed to the current International Classification of Disease that comfortably singles out the respective specialty discipline. 5 Medicaldental integration must occur for the new thinking of precision medicine/big data medicine to bear fruit in the clinical practice of orofacial pain. Nevertheless, the transition from average response medicine to applying data science in orofacial pain practice will take its time, as did the development of the national highway system. 2 However, the emergence of a national highway system that ultimately yielded unprecedented interstate travel as an analogy demands a redefinition of the scientific approach to orofacial pain. Failure to do so will only hurt the discipline in the long run.",

Healthcare providers have undergone training to better assess pain and substance use disorder risk, as well as the importance of referring their patients for mental health care. Since they largely deal with acute pain, dentists were somewhat late in recognizing these issues, and continued to unwittingly prescribe large amounts of opioids for procedures such as 3rd molar extractions. 1 Nonetheless, educational outreach had an impact, and now we have seen a substantive reduction in opioid prescribing in dental practice. Indeed, there is a clear recognition that non-opioid analgesics may be equally or effective for their patients. 2 Collaboration between Tufts and Harvard University faculty resulted in the award of two grants aimed at developing, validating, and dissemination a series of 10 training modules addressing Controlled Substance Risk Assessment for dentistry. These materials are now fully accessible, and we anticipate future updates. 3, 4 Although developing and providing risk mitigation content proves challenging in all areas of healthcare, there are unique barriers in dentistry. Dentists still typically fail to undertake even brief controlled substance risk assessments in their practices. This group also remains among the least adherent with respect to checking and documenting results of state Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). 5 which no members of the faculty are registered with their state PDMP, while others have 100% of their staff participating in the state mandated program. We undertook an electronic dental record review for 2018 and 2019, accessing 3500 e-records. Although some subspecialty practices may have been excluded, we found only 12 e-record hits in a search using multiple PDMP terms. Are dentists failing to utilize the state PDMPs, or just failing to document the results of their searches? The answer remains unclear.",

Opioid moderatism in dentistry was suggested as early as 1999, with Bullock noting the subjectivity of pain severity and the imperative of taking a phenomenological approach to each patient's analgesia needs. 5 Regarding patients with chemical dependency issues, Chiodo and Tolle noted the ethical obligation of dentists to avoid simply refusing to prescribe, but rather to consider prescription within the context of multimodal care -including referral to chemical dependence specialists. 6 Groundbreaking work by Denisco and colleagues 7 in 2011 elucidated the importance of risk mitigation by dentists prescribing opioids, including balancing individual patients' needs for analgesia with societal responsibility, interprofessional communication, disposal of leftover opioids and drug take-back programs, use of a screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) model, potential use of urine drug testing, and consultation with states' Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). PDMP use among dentists remains inconsistent, with results of a 2019 national study indicating that 46.6% of dentists reported having never consulted with a PDMP, 8 and a 2020 investigation determining that only 49.5% of dentists were even PDMP-registered, which was lower than physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists. 9 Reducing opioid prescribing in dentistry has demonstrated its benefits, although it is important to recognize that cessation of all opioid prescribing is not going to be beneficial to many patients and to the profession. \"Opioid moderatism\" is heavily contingent upon prescribers taking responsibility for mitigating risk. As has been the case in non-dental medicine, failure to mitigate risk in dentistry will potentially result in opiophobia and efforts toward opioid eradication. Dentistry is already witnessing published recommendations for arbitrary prescribing limits, 10 as well as methodologically flawed research \"supportive\" of eradicating opioid analgesia in dentistry from potentially biased investigators. 11 In order to avoid causing harm to our patients and maintain acceptable levels of patient satisfaction in addition to maintaining the integrity and humanity of the profession, all dentists need to avoid becoming \"anti-opioid\" or \"pro-opioid\", and take an opioid moderatist stance of being \"pro-patient\". Doing so will require prescribing judiciously when opioids are necessary, as well as taking measures to mitigate risk as thoroughly and consistently as is possible.",

Subjects were asked to report use of all analgesic medications for each of seven days following the procedure, and both instructions and prescriptions were standardized. Of the 81 patients who completed the study, only 6 (7%) took any oxycodone over the first postoperative week; the average number of oxycodone pills used was 0.04 \u00b10.24. Patients instead relied primarily on ibuprofen and acetaminophen, which were used for an average of 4.6\u00b12.2 and 3.4\u00b11.9 days postoperatively, respectively. Six oxycodone tablets were prescribed to each patient during the study; at the end of the study period, 466 prescribed oxycodone tablets remained unfilled or unused. The only variable that was significantly associated with a higher use of any postoperative analgesic medication was sex: females used more analgesics than males.

Recently, COVID-19 related stresses have precipitated an increased use of opioids, alcohol and cannabinoids, 1 and dental data have estimated an increased prevalence of symptomatic complaints from daytime clenching or nighttime grinding by at least 15% over prepandemic periods. 2 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective for post-operative dental and musculoskeletal pain and are the mainstay for acute pain; they exist in several chemical subtypes (\"families\"), and individual patients may respond better to one family than another. NSAID use is limited by widespread toxicities including renal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and central nervous system (CNS) toxicities. Relatively selective cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors such as celecoxib or meloxicam reduce GI toxicity but may carry the same or marginally greater cardiovascular risks over nonselective agents. 3 Estimates attribute NSAIDs as responsible for approximately 3200-16,500 deaths in the United States annually due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and current recommendations are to use the lowest effective dose of NSAIDs for the shortest time possible. 4 Neuropathic pain conditions are often managed effectively with anticonvulsants or mixed-reuptake antidepressants such as amitriptyline or duloxetine. The older tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are considered to have greater efficacy for neuropathic pain despite having more cardiovascular and CNS toxicities than do newer agents. Both older tricyclic and newer antidepressants are contraindicated with significant heart or liver disease. Tramadol and tapentadol are options for neuropathic and non-neuropathic pains in patients who may be limited by side effects of other agents, but share potential toxicities of both antidepressants (eg, seizures) and those of opioids (eg, dizziness or confusion). Tapentadol requires caution in patients with kidney dysfunction. Gabapentin and pregabalin are generally well-tolerated with similar effectiveness to antidepressants. They are associated with drowsiness, dizziness or mood changes (eg, depression) but less often with life-threatening side effects than other drug classes for neuropathic pain.",

Alternative medications include NSAIDs, local anesthetics, muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, and biological agents (eg, botulinum toxin). Mechanistically, these agents work either peripherally or centrally by decreasing a pain stimulus, pain transmission from the periphery to the central nervous system, or by altering pain perception in the cerebral cortex.

            "text": "Depending on interpretation of the term, \"telehealth\" has existed for hundreds of years, with examples of telehealth service being employed during the Civil War in the form of telegraph usage. Video-based telemedicine was reported in the 1950s and 1960s and instances of teledentistry were described as early as the 1990s, yet teledentistry usage remained relatively limited until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 1,2 Beginning in early 2020, with many patients reluctant to seek care in person and health care practices unable to accommodate them due to capacity limits and other restrictions, telehealth has provided an opportunity both in the United States and abroad to continue providing service to patients who otherwise would have been unable to seek care. 3 Early studies have suggested that, for appropriate cases, patients and providers are generally satisfied with telehealth services and believe that telehealth makes it easier to receive care. 4 Selected departments at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) began utilizing telehealth services relatively early in the pandemic. Beyond the benefit of being able to provide care to patients while clinics were closed for non-emergency services, TUSDM telehealth providers have found anecdotally an advantage of fewer canceled patient post-operative visits when compared to in-person appointments. However, teledentistry has limitations when compared to in-person visits, including intra-oral evaluation, additional documentation and the associated burden on staff, technical restrictions and the need for longer appointment times, and security concerns. Requesting submission of intra-oral photographs in advance of an appointment may supplement the patient evaluation, and this practice is recommended; however, the quality of the photographs may vary based on factors including the location of the lesion, the device used by the patient to take the photograph, and the experience of the patient as a photographer. Providers are encouraged to provide documentation in the patient's health record including: consent to undergo telehealth services; confirmation of audio and video connections; the physical location of, role of, and type of device used by each participant; and appointment start and end times. Telehealth interstate practice regulations vary by state, and while most states have modified current telehealth practice guidelines during the state of emergency, providers are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the regulations of the states in which both they and their patients are physically located. When considering which of the multiple platforms available for conducting telehealth visits to use, providers must verify that their choice of application satisfies all patient privacy concerns.",

            "text": "Prior to the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic and associated mitigation measures, the United States had entered the \"fourth-wave\" of an opioid epidemic. Whereas earlier waves of the epidemic were characterized by increases in overdose deaths primarily attributable to prescription opioids (first wave), heroin (second wave), and synthetic illicit opioids (third wave), the country was beginning to experience upticks in overdose deaths involving psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. 1 However, multi-level interventions addressing licit and illicit drug supplies, prevention, treatment expansion, and naloxone distribution culminated in 2018, contributing to the first national decline in drug overdose deaths in 28 years. 2 Two cornerstones of these nationwide efforts to decrease risk for overdose included expansion of access to: (1) gold-standard medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone; and (2) the overdose reversing agent, naloxone. 3 Systemic disparities in access to treatment, as well as financial instability and associated gaps in insurance coverage, were key drivers of the opioid epidemic prior to the pandemic. 4, 5 Early data regarding the impacts of COVID-19 and associated mitigation measures suggest that these disparities have been exacerbated, likely contributing to upticks in fatal and non-fatal overdose specifically, and increased substance abuse behaviors more broadly. [6] [7] [8] Strong evidence supports the effectiveness of MOUD in reducing all-cause and overdose related mortality and suggests that substance use treatment response falls in line with that of other chronic, relapsing conditions such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and asthma. 9, 10 In spite of these realities, treatment for substance use disorders, including MOUD, has continued to be largely siloed from mainstream healthcare, perhaps making it particularly vulnerable to pandemic-related impacts. 11 Though delays in care and the impacts of diminished healthcare expenditures had a widespread impact across the healthcare sector, 12 these impacts appeared to more severely affect services that were less amenable -for a variety of reasons -to virtual care delivery. 13 Similar to dental medicine, addiction medicine was particularly hard hit by both individual/patient-level delays in seeking care, as well as systemic closure or limited-service provision by substance use treatment providers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation measures.",

            "text": "In response to the widespread effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, several temporary but noteworthy national measures were put into place to address disruptions in MOUD access and naloxone availability by increasing the provider base and decreasing barriers to access. Measures broadly included increased flexibility for MOUD providers, such as: allowing take-home dosing for stable methadone patients, waiving the requirement for an in-person initial visit prior to initiating treatment with buprenorphine via telehealth, and encouragement of waivers of counseling and psychosocial treatment requirements when these presented as a barrier to patients receiving MOUD. These measures, though currently temporary, present a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of these policy-level changes on MOUD treatment access, utilization, and outcomes, as well as on associated safety data regarding diversion and adverse events. 14 Planned investigations are currently in their early stages. Despite the deserved attention paid to the increasing role of illicit drugs (particularly fentanyl and psychostimulants) in the overdose epidemic, as well as noted national declines in both opioid prescribing and prescription opioid-involved overdose, it is important to note that prescription opioids continue to contribute to a substantial number of overdose deaths each year. 1 Although more recent data are needed, data predating the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that patterns of opioid prescribing vary by location and that a minority of dentists continue to prescribe opioids in excess of recommendations for acute pain management. 16, 17 Continued vigilance among dental prescribers is warranted when considering opioids for pain management, particularly among adolescents and young adults, given the potential risk conferred for future opioid use and abuse. 18 Consistent with American Dental Association recommendations, 19 dental prescribers should standardly consider non-opioid alternatives as first-line pain management options, and if prescribing an opioid, should utilize prescription drug monitoring resources and provide thorough patient counseling regarding pain management expectations and opioid risk mitigation strategies (eg, secure storage, timely disposal).",

The CDC also recommended postponing all non-essential dental services. 10 It was not until August 3 that the WHO issued interim guidance advising the delay of all non-urgent dental care until sufficient reduction in community COVID-19 transmission rates were achieved, nearly 5 months after its first pandemic declaration. 11 To make matters more confusing, the ADA then responded with a public statement that \"respectfully and strongly\" disagreed with said WHO guidelines from August 3. 12 Research has shown that clear, effective health communication informs and influences health decisions. During COVID-19, not only were healthcare services limited but health information was also disseminated in ways that were not equally understandable to different groups. 13 From the provider side, clinics forced to limit their services for several months also dealt with inconsistent reopening criteria across geographic areas, while also facing financial pressures and social distancing requirements. From the patient side, this likely exacerbated already-existing healthcare disparities in oral health and pain medicine for vulnerable populations. Even though the full extent of pandemic-related data are not yet available, alreadyvulnerable populations likely had greater difficulty with access and care utilization during the pandemic than did other already-healthier individuals.",

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) detects concentration variations of oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb), such as blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in fMRI. It measures the absorption of near-infrared light at wavelengths between 700 and 1000 nm, non-invasively through the skull. 6,7 fNIRS is a portable neuroimaging device with similar technical benefits as fMRI. Recent fNIRS studies have concentrated on accessible key cortical regions for pain processing, facilitating neuro-engineering design (eg, sensor numbers and placement) with maximum output and benefit for pain decoding. For example, it is now possible with fNIRS to evaluate a patient's cortical activation before, during, and after dental hypersensitivity pain with the patient in the dental chair. 8, 9 Researchers reported well-defined hemodynamic cortical activations in two regions, primary sensory (S1) and prefrontal cortices (PFC), which were elicited by thermal stimulation to the affected tooth from expectation to pain detection. The patient's clinical pain experience was fully predicted concomitantly by the baseline functional connectivity between S1 and PFC and a well-defined stepwise sequence of hemodynamic cortical responses. 9 The sensory-discriminative and cognitive-emotional cascade of brain responses were initiated during the clinical pain expectation (pre-pain phase) with activations in the contralateral S1 orofacial homuncular region and also in the bilateral PFC. Such activations were followed by flat response or deactivation at PFC and further S1 responses when the cold stimuli crossed noxious levels (pain phase). Following such findings, the group developed a framework technology that objectively visualizes, measures, and decodes in real-time the ongoing cascade of cortical activities when and where there is clinical pain to optimize pain diagnosis, treatment and training. This framework was successfully tested in patients experiencing dental hypersensitivity with evoked pain through 3-step experiments integrating clinical (optical) neuroimaging, augmented reality (AR), and neural network-based artificial intelligence (AI), called CLARAi. 10 Additional studies are needed to expand brain-pain biomarkers to other conditions and contexts in the clinical environment, such as in high-risk decisionmaking processes in dental and medical emergency settings. The concept of \"seeing pain\" directly from the patient's brain in the clinic is achievable. 11",

The last report, building on the landmark Gies Report of 1926, 8 dentistry's Flexner Report equivalent, started with the premise that dentistry must be like ophthalmology (part of the whole person care team) and not optometry (technical service providers) but fell short on recommendations for change that could address the cultural divide and promote integration. The data suggest an overall decrease in science and whole patient health education among dental schools, persistence of procedural training, and lack of mandatory internships, underscoring the marginalization of dentists from the rest of the health care team.
