We examine an ensemble of public health metrics to assess the control of COVID-19 epidemic in women-vs men-led countries worldwide based on 10 data available up to June 3. The median of the distribution of median time-varying effective reproduction number for women and men led countries were 0.89 and 1.14 respectively with the 95% two-sample bootstrap-based confidence interval for the difference (women -men) being [-0.335, 0.028]. In terms of scale of testing, the median percentage of population tested were 3.28% (women), 1.59% (men) [95% CI: (-1.285%, 3.600%)] with test positive rates of 2.69% (women) 15 and 4.94% (men) respectively. It appears that though statistically not significant, countries led by women have an edge over countries led by men in terms of public health metrics for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.",

There has been a wave of articles in the media that celebrate the COVID-19 response efforts in women-led countries (2) along with the promotion of progressive policies which would reduce severe COVID-19 outcomes (3) . In this note, we attempt to quantify the effect of women leaders more broadly across the world in terms of public health and policy relevant measures that have been widely discussed in the last three months for controlling a 30 pandemic. Instead of qualitative comparisons and statements, we assess statistical significance of the hypotheses that performance is different between women and men heads of nations.",

            "text": "consider the doubling time (DT) metric and case-fatality rate (CFR) metric under the same analytical lens. To evaluate the scale of diagnostic testing to identify new COVID-19 cases, we compare 85 countries which have released testing data (67 led by men and 18 led by women) on 20 the basis of two metrics: percentage of population tested and percentage of positive tests. We present clustered bar plots comparing percentage of population tested and percentage of positive tests for these 85 countries (Figure 2). Results: Figure S2 reveals a shift in the sex-stratified distributions of median, mean, maximum 25 and most recent values of R(t) ---they have more probability weight towards smaller values for the women (lower the R, slower is the transmission). Comparing the two distributions (women vs men) on the basis of median of time-varying R(t) yields a median value of 0.893 for women and 1.14 for men. Values of R below unity are desirable. The bootstrap procedure comparing difference of median (women-men) yields a 95% CI of [-0.335, 0.028]. Similar comparisons 30 between sex-stratified distributions of mean of time-varying R(t) yields a median of 1.23 for women and 1.42 for men and a 95% CI of the difference as [-0.382, 0.072]. Comparing maximum of the time-varying R(t) yields a median value of 4.40 for women and 4.61 for men, with the 95% CI for their difference given by [-1.553, 1.701]. A group-wise comparison of most recent R(t) (as of 3rd June) yields a median of 0.790 for women and 1.05 for men, with 95% CI [-0.413, 0.090].",
