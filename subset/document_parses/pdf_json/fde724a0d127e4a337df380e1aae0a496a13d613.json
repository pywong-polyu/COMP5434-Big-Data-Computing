In humans, the main routes of transmission are respiratory droplets and close contact with infected individuals or through contact with an object infected with the virus, followed by touching mouth, nose, or eyes. It is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 was originated in wild animals and was then transmitted to humans. Although some wildlife and domestic animals can be naturally or experimentally infected with the virus, the intermediate hosts that transmitted it to humans are still unknown. Understanding the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 associated with possible zoonotic transmission of intermediate hosts is considered critical. Reportedly, cats or dogs living with COVID-19-positive humans tested positive for the disease, suggesting that the virus was transmitted to the animals from humans. Information regarding the epidemiological investigation and comprehensive studies is limited. Therefore, it is still unclear how high is the correlation of infection in humans and pet animals, especially those living together. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pets of patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at the Wangaya hospital, Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia.",

On February 17, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that SARS-CoV-2 had spread globally [1, 2] . The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days, and the main routes of transmission are respiratory droplets and close individual-to-individual contact (within 1 m). SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the lungs in the early stages and probably attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express angiotensin-converting enzyme II, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys. Respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major threats to patients as well as the major cause of death [3] . One of the most significant and severe clinical signs occurring in humans is a respiratory symptom, as the virus targets the lungs; the infection is also sometimes accompanied by other clinical symptoms such as fever and diarrhea. occur if an individual touches an object infected with the virus and then touches mouth, nose, or eyes [4] [5] [6] [7] . Presumably, SARS-CoV-2 originated from wild animals and was then transmitted to humans. Although some wildlife and domestic animals, including cats and dogs, can be infected with the virus, the intermediate hosts that transmitted the virus to humans are still unknown. Reportedly, cats and dogs have been reported to be susceptible to alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirus, known as feline CoVs and canine CoVs [8, 9] ; therefore, these animals may also be susceptible to betacoronavirus.",

The critical cases met one of the following criteria: Respiratory failure and requiring mechanical ventilation or shock, or other organ damage combined with hospitalization in the intensive care unit. The samples were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using protocols provided in the WHO 2020 manual [12] , with slight modification. First, biosafety and biosecurity considerations were strongly implemented to prevent disease transmission from animals to officers and/or to the environment. This was primarily done by washing hands with soap/disinfectant and using personal protective equipment. For safety reasons associated with animal welfare practices, targeted pets were anesthetized before samples collection from nasal and oral cavities. The swab samples were obtained using a plastic stem from the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal swab) and oropharynx. Then, the samples were properly placed in sterile tubes containing viral transport media and then sent to the Biotechnology Section of Disease Investigation Center in Denpasar for further analysis. Targeted viral RNAs were then isolated from the swab samples according to the QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen,-USA), before being amplified by the RdRP gene using One-Step RT-AgPath-ID One-Step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) \u00ae (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The RT-PCR master mix was 25 \u00b5L and comprised 12.5 \u00b5L 1\u00d7RT-PCR reaction buffer, 1 \u00b5L of forward primer, 1 \u00b5L of reverse primer, 1 \u00b5L of specific probe (concentration: 5 pmol/\u00b5L), 3.5 \u00b5L of dH2O, 1 \u00b5L of RT-PCR enzyme mix, and 5 \u00b5L of template. cDNA synthesis was conducted by reverse transcription method at 55\u00b0C for 5 min. PCR steps included 1 cycle of pre-denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 s followed by an amplification of 40 cycles with each of the following temperatures: Denaturation of 95\u00b0C for 5 s, annealing 60\u00b0C for 60 s, and extension at 68\u00b0C for 15 s.",

However, the WHO and Centers of Disease Control have consistently recommended that individuals limit their contact with their pets, probably to reduce the risk of infecting their pets with the virus, in whom the virus can replicate. Accordingly, the present study was conducted to provide further confirmation regarding whether pets in close contact with individuals with confirmed COVID=Coronavirus disease, SARS-CoV-2=Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.14/November-2021/19.pdf COVID-19 harbor or do not harbor the virus. We found that all RNA samples prepared from the seven suspected pets, tested using RT-PCR, and were negative; this was irrespective of the fact that the pets belonged to owners with a history of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Furthermore, house interaction (daily close contact) was prevalent between the owners and their pets as well as with other family members. As the RNA samples tested were not positive through PCR, the current findings suggested that no viral gene associated with SARS-CoV-2 was found in the animals tested. This result possibly supports findings reported to date [6, 10, 13] . Consequently, pets may not be susceptible to COVID-19, unlike humans. However, further research may be required to confirm the current findings and to determine transmission from pets to humans. This is because the findings may also be related to the limited number of pets enrolled in our study, conferring a bias in the results. However, limited studies have been conducted showing that pets, such as dogs and cats, can be infected by COVID-19 [11, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In March 2020, Parry reported that a 30-year-old woman in Hong Kong was diagnosed with COVID-19 after her dog tested positive for the virus. In Belgium, cat tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 1 week after its owner was diagnosed with COVID-19 [1] . If pets develop an unexplained illness and have been exposed to an individual with SARS-CoV-2, their owners should inform public health officials or public health veterinarians who will advise the owner to take the pet to a veterinary clinic. There is a lack of evidence supporting the view that pets have a role in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Even so, the entire clinical team should maintain a good level of hygiene practice throughout the veterinary interaction, particularly with animals in contact with infected individuals. Pet owners, themselves, should limit their contact with their pets and always wash hands before and after interacting with their pets [20] [21] [22] [23] .",
