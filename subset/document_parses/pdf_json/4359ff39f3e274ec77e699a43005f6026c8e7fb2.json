First, an efficient and simple access to the crystalline di-tert-butyl(hydroxymethyl)phosphonate was developed. O-Mesylation gave high yields of the active phosphonomethylation reagent. For the synthesis of tenofovir, a two-step sequence was developed using Mg(O t Bu) 2 as the base for the alkylation of (R)-9-(2-hydroxypropyl)adenine. Subsequent deprotection could be achieved with aqueous acids. (Di-tert-butoxyphosphoryl)methyl methanesulfonate showed to be the most efficient electrophile tested, affording PMPA in 72% yield on a 5 g scale. The developed protocol could also be applied for the preparation of the hepatitis B drug adefovir (64% yield/1 g scale).",

            "text": "The nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir (1, PMPA), which was described by Balzarini in 1993, 1 currently belongs to the most frequently applied human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medications. To enable oral application and to increase bioavailability, a prodrug unit is required, which led to the development of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (2, TDF), which was approved by the FDA for HIV treatment in 2001 and later in 2008 for hepatitis B virus therapy. 2 In 2010, tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (3, TAF) ( Figure 1 ) was launched, which showed fewer side effects and better tolerability than TDF. 3 In the course of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, testing tenofovir as potential medication for SARS-CoV2 also moved in the focus of attention. It could be demonstrated that the triphosphate of tenofovir inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of this virus in vitro. 4 These results were supported by a study, which investigated the incidence and severity of COVID-19 from 77,590 HIV-positive persons receiving antiretroviral therapy. There was a lower risk of COVID-19, less related hospitalization, and even no mortality for people who were treated with Truvada [TDF + FTC (emtricitabine)] than for people who had taken other antiviral drugs. 5 There is also an ongoing clinical study in Spain with 4000 medical workers investigating Truvada as potential prophylaxis for COVID- 19. 6 Thus, the demand for tenofovir could further rise in the future. Because of a lack of a diverse set of industrial syntheses of tenofovir, raw material dependency can lead to unsteady prices and drug shortages. Therefore, diversification of the synthetic portfolio is an attractive goal.",

Ripin et al. reported that using Mg(O t Bu) 2 as a base showed the best conversion (>90%) for alkylation. Tele-scoping the two steps proved to be beneficial to circumvent the inconvenient workup and the continuous extraction of the water-soluble phosphonate ester 6. Furthermore, the costs of the deprotection step could be reduced by replacing the hitherto used expensive TMSBr 8 by TMSCl/NaBr. However, the workup was still elaborate, as several filtration and extraction steps were required, while simultaneously avoiding any moisture. Despite a reported significant loss of the product in the magnesium salt cake (up to 15%), PMPA\u00b7H 2 O could be isolated in 59% yield.",

            "text": "In 2016, Riley et al. reported that Mg(O t Bu) 2 could be replaced by in situ generation from MeMgCl and t BuOH. The group developed an improved method to isolate the phosphonate diester 6 after continuous extraction in 85% yield. Subsequent deprotection with HBr/acetic acid afforded PMPA\u00b7H 2 O in 67% yield (57% over two steps) (Scheme 1). 9 Recently, Derstine et al. published a new approach for making PMPA on a multigram scale. They found conditions to alkylate HPA with the free phosphonic acid of DESMP by using NaO t Bu as a base in dimethylformamide (DMF). This very efficient process gave PMPA in 70% yield. 10 It is conspicuous that all reports investigating the challenging synthesis of PMPA focused only on DESMP or the derived free acid 7 as alkylating agents with HPA. One big selling point is of course the fact that DESMP can be made from cheap commodity chemicals and has an industrial well-established process. Nevertheless, the overall yield starting from diethyl phosphite (8) has been reported to be only 60\u221270% with varying degrees of purity (Scheme 2). 11 The biggest drawback of using DESMP in the synthesis of PMPA remains the deprotection of the diethyl ester. Besides expensive (TMSBr 6 ) or excessive amounts of reagents (TMSCl/NaBr 7 ), an elaborate workup including several filtrations and extractions is necessary. Silicon-containing byproducts have also been reported. 12 Other conditions (aq. HBr, dry HCl gas, AlCl 3 , 13 or HOAc/HBr 9 ) led to lower yields. There is no variation in the alkyl group of oyxmethyl phosphonates reported in the literature other than the use of diisopropyl ester, which requires similar conditions for the deprotection as the diethyl ester 6. 14, 15 Tert-butyl phosphonates 16, 17 are also known for being deprotected under aqueous acidic conditions. In this report, the synthesis of di-tert-butyl oxymethyl phosphonates and their suitability for preparing PMPA was investigated. An industrially feasible process was the aim of this work (Scheme 3). (9) is commercially available but expensive. It can be synthesized by adding PCl 3 to a cooled solution of tertbutanol in the presence of a base (triethylamine, pyridine, or dimethylaniline) in a nonpolar solvent (ligroin, petroleum ether, and diethyl ether). The reported yields vary widely (40\u2212 77%). 18\u221223 Chemoselectivity (triester 10 vs diester 9, Figure 2 ) also proved to be an issue. 24 Mark and Van Wazer, who focused their investigations on the selective synthesis of tri-tert-butyl phosphite (10), enlightened more details about the reaction of PCl 3 and tertbutanol. They proved that almost only triester 10 forms in the reaction. Nevertheless, 10 decomposes quickly at 50\u00b0C under reduced pressure yielding the diester 9. Furthermore, they reported that triester 10 was prone to rapid aerial oxidation to tri-tert-butyl phosphate (11, Figure 2 ). In terms of the selective synthesis of the diester, 11 represents an undesired byproduct, which can only be avoided by strict exclusion of oxygen during preparation and workup. The reported varying yields could be explained by the fact that diester 9 has been reported to be very sensitive to incautious heating and some product is lost during distillation. 19, 20 In order to make tert-butyl phosphite interesting for an industrial application, the development of a more efficient synthesis was attempted.",

            "text": "It appeared worth trying the reaction of KO t Bu with PCl 3 instead of tert-butanol and an organic base. As a benefit, KO t Bu would combine both the reagent and base, while only potassium chloride would be accumulated as a coproduct. In initial experiments, PCl 3 was added to a KO t Bu/tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution while cooling. Following the reaction by 1 H/ 31 P NMR spectroscopy also revealed the formation of triester, diester, and phosphate. However, when the order of addition was reversed, predominant diester formation was observed and none of the potential impurities 10 and 11 could be detected using 31 P NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, adding solid KO t Bu instead of a THF solution, which was slightly more convenient regarding handling, gave similar results. For the workup, the reaction mixture was quenched with saturated NaHCO 3 solution to maintain a basic pH in order to prevent acid-catalyzed cleavage of the tert-butyl groups. It is worth mentioning that despite a second aqueous washing step, all the product remained in the organic phase and no further extraction was necessary. Using 3.0 equiv of KO t Bu, 98% of crude 9 ( 31 P NMR purity: 75%) was obtained after workup ( Table 1 , entry 1). Further investigations revealed that subsequent reduction of the equivalents of KO t Bu improved the purity of the crude product (Table 1 , entries 2\u22125). When the reaction was performed with 2.5 equiv of KO t Bu, 76% of crude 9 could be obtained showing a high purity in 1 H and 31 P NMR spectroscopies (see the Supporting Information for details).",

However, there were always small amounts of paraformaldehyde precipitating on the bottom of the septum. Therefore, a slight excess of paraformaldehyde (0.1 equiv) had to be used. Depending on the scale and reactor size, the precipitating paraformaldehyde could lead to variable conversion and made unwelcome additional purification necessary. To circumvent this issue at least under laboratory conditions, it was efficient to fill the gas room of the flask and the balloon with argon. Paraformaldehyde precipitation could not be observed anymore, and consequently, the equivalents of paraformaldehyde could be further decreased to 1.0 equiv, while temperature and time were also adjusted. Crude 9 derived from the esterification in MTBE could be hydroxymethylated in 66% yield ( Table 4 , entry 2), while crude 9 derived from the esterification in Me-THF furnished 12 in 72% (Table 4 , entry 3).

The flask was stored in a freezer overnight at \u221224\u00b0C when 12 crystallized out (if no crystallization took place, slight shaking or inoculating helped). The supernatant mother liquor was decanted, and the solid was washed twice with cold MeCN (\u221224\u00b0C, 2 \u00d7 5 mL). The solid was dried in vacuo at 30\u00b0C to afford 12 (8.90 g). Concentrating the mother liquor and storing in a freezer overnight yielded a second pure crystallisate (1.97 g). In total, 10. 13 . In an oven-dried Schlenk flask, di-tertbutyl(hydroxymethyl)phosphonate (3.00 g, 13.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv), NEt 3 (2.1 mL, 14.7 mmol, 1.1 equiv), and DMAP (0.16 g, 1.34 mmol, 0.1 equiv) were dissolved in dry DCM (100 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. Tosyl chloride (2.81 g, 14.7 mmol, 1.1 equiv) was added, and the solution was stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere at r.t. for 24 h (99% conversion by 31 P NMR spectroscopy). The reaction mixture was washed with saturated NaHCO 3 solution (70 mL), and the organic phase was separated. After drying over NaSO 4 , all volatiles were removed in vacuo at 30\u00b0C [CAUTION! High temperatures can lead to decomposition (dealkylation)]. The crude product (4.93 g) was dissolved in warm EtOH (17 mL, max 50\u00b0C), cooled to r.t., and stored in a freezer (\u221224\u00b0C) overnight. The supernatant mother liquor was decanted, and the crystallized solid was washed with two portions of cold (\u221224\u00b0C) EtOH (2 \u00d7 3 mL). After drying in vacuo at 30\u00b0C, 13 was obtained as a colorless solid in 87% yield (4.41 g, 11.7 mmol, 87%). For longer storage, it is recommended to store the compound in a refrigerator or freezer. M (C 16 In an oven-dried Schlenk flask, di-tert-butyl-(hydroxymethyl)phosphonate (12.94 g, 57.71 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was dissolved in dry DCM (200 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. NEt 3 (9.70 mL, 69.2 mmol, 1.2 equiv) was added, and the solution was cooled in an ice bath. Mesyl chloride (4.90 mL, 63.5 mmol, 1.1 equiv) was added drop-wise to the solution within 4 min, the ice bath was removed, and the solution was stirred at r.t. for 19 h (reaction control by thinlayer chromatography). The reaction mixture was washed twice with sat. NaHCO 3 solution (2 \u00d7 150 mL), and the organic phase was separated.

Dry DMA (65 mL) was added, and the suspension was stirred at 90\u00b0C for 30 min. While purging with nitrogen, (di-tert-butoxyphosphoryl)methyl methanesulfonate (14, 11 .74 g, 38.82 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was added portion-wise within 1 min. The reaction mixture was stirred at 90\u00b0C for 22 h (90% conversion of HPA detected by HPLC at 254 nm). All volatiles were removed in vacuo at 50\u221260\u00b0C, and 1.5 M H 2 SO 4 (50 mL) was added to the orange-brownish residue. During heating to 60\u00b0C, a yellowish solution formed. After 4 h (complete dealkylation to PMPA detected by HPLC at \u03bb = 254 nm), the solution was cooled in an ice bath. Additional water (20 mL) was added, and the pH was adjusted to pH = 2.8\u22123 using conc. NH 3 solution (25 wt %, 3 mL). A colorless to slight yellowish suspension formed, which was stirred while cooling for 1 h and then stored in a refrigerator overnight. The next day, the suspension was vacuum-filtered and washed with icecold water (4 \u00d7 4 mL) and ice-cold acetone (3 \u00d7 4 mL).

In the first screening, different aprotic polar solvents [DMF, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl acetamide (DMA), and Nmethylpyrrolidone (NMP)] were investigated, while an excess of mesylate 14 (2.5 equiv) was used to accomplish a complete conversion of HPA.The best results were observed when O-alkylation was performed in NMP or DMA at 90\u00b0C. Mainly, monoester 16 formation occurred along with only small amounts of byproducts.
