But the use of xenogeneic ingredients will increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. Human platelet lysate (HPL) is a potential surrogate and used in human cell expansion with reliability in clinical applications. In this study, we synthesized chitosan/gelatin/gellan gum hydrogel supplemented with HPL and investigated the effect of 3D culture for SHED. TMT-tagged proteomics was used to decipher the secretome protein profiles of SHEDs and a total of 3209 proteins were identified, of which 23 were up-regulated and 192 were down-regulated. The results showed that hydrogel supplemented with HPL promoted SHED proliferation. After induction, the hydrogel coating contributed to osteogenic differentiation, adipogenic differentiation and differentiation into neural-like cells of SHED. SHED encapsulated in a hydrogel promotes migration and angiogenesis of HUVEC. In conclusion, our research found that hydrogel supplemented with HPL can be used as a method for SHED in standardized production and can contribute to the clinical application of SHED in cell therapy.",

SHED is a promising material source for tissue regeneration due to it is involved in osteogenesis and angiogenesis [4] . Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can enhances the vascular differentiation and osteogenic differentiation of SHED. SHED can be induced by angiogenic differentiation through efficient activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Furthermore, activation of Wnt signaling can induce vascular differentiation of postnatal mesenchymal stem cells [5] . In particular, as mesenchymal stem cells develop from neural crest in embryonic period, SHED has shown great potential for application in neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and so on [6, 7] .",

            "text": "The primary evaluation factor of stem cell therapy strategy is safety, which leads to the use of heterologous substances in cell culture media that should be seriously considered [8] . Xenogeneic ingredients, especially fetal bovine serum (FBS), are commonly used as growth factor supplements for cell culture. However, FBS will increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission during the use of animal-derived products, including the risk of immune response, viruses, bacteria and prions [9] . In addition, FBS is susceptible to batch variation, resulting in poor repeatability [10] . Human platelet lysate (HPL) is a good alternative to supplement stem cell culture medium for FBS. First of all, HPL can be easily separated and obtained from apheresis products and buffy coat in the form of pooled blood [10] . Secondly, HPL is composed of abundant growth factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin 3 (NTF3), brain derived growth factor (BDNF), and glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and so on. These abundant growth factors provide a suitable environment to support cell viability, proliferation, anti-aging, axonal elongation, genome and immunophenotypic stability. Furthermore, previous reports found that HPL showed reliability to be applied to stem cell culture supplements in quality control, safety and GMP-compliant HPL production release standards [11] [12] [13] .",

In this study, non-covalent interactions, including electrostatic, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding, were used to prepare hydrogel [15] . We designed a hydrogel, which were prepared from three biomacromolecules, including gelatin, chitosan, and gellan gum (GG). Gelatin is a molecule derived from the abundant extracellular matrix protein collagen, and gellan gum is able to form hydrogel with tunable mechanical properties. Chitosan can support the maintenance of proliferative capacity and pluripotency of stem cells in long-term culture [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . They are widely used in regenerative medicine engineering. We previously confirmed that proteomics was convenient for interpreting the protein expression profile of tooth-derived stem cells [21] . The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of HPL on the cell proliferation, adipogenic differentiation, osteogenic differentiation, vascular differentiation and neural-like cells differentiation of SHED, and to interpret the impact of Chitosan/ gelatin/gellan gum hydrogel supplemented with HPL on the protein profile of SHED through quantitative proteomics. Our study will help to promote the application of 3D culture supplemented with HPL in the standardized production and clinical application of stem cells.",

The proteomics results showed that HPL-supplemented hydrogel up-regulated the expression of proteins related to cell migration and angiogenesis in SHED. The results showed that there were widespread interactions between these proteins (Additional file 5: Table S5 ), including APOB, APOD, MIF, CD44, PF4, APOE and FERMT3 (Fig. 4A) . A co-culture system was constructed by SHED and HUVEC to evaluate cell migration and angiogenesis. The statistical results showed that SHED-encapsulated hydrogel supplemented with HPL can improve cell migration rate, the tube number of per field, the total length of the tube, and branch number of angiogenesis in the co-culture system (Fig. 4B-G) . The results revealed that SHED can promote the cell migration and angiogenesis of HUVEC (p < 0.05), and HPLsupplemented hydrogel can significantly enhance these benefits (Fig. 4B-C) .",

            "text": "In summary, we synthesized chitosan/gelatin/gellan glue hydrogel supplemented with HPL and investigated the effect of 3D culture on the proliferation, multi-lineage differentiation and secretome of SHED. We found that a total of 3209 proteins were identified, of which 23 were up-regulated and 192 were down-regulated. The results showed that 3D culture promoted SHED proliferation and enhanced the expression of stemness genes NANOG, and low expression of negative surface markers in flow cytometry suggested that 3D culture was suitable for standardized production. After 3-4 weeks of induction, the hydrogel coating contributed to osteogenic differentiation of SHED with the expression of osteogenic-related genes RUNX2 and OSTEOPONTIN. In addition, the hydrogel supplemented with HPL enhanced the adipogenic differentiation of SHED with the expression of adipogenic-related genes LPL and PPAR\u03b32. After the addition of neural-inducing differentiation factors, SHED encapsulated in hydrogel supplemented with HPL differentiated into neural-like cells and expressed neural markers Nestin and GFAP. We established the relationship between protein expression and proliferation, osteogenesis, adipogenesis, angiogenesis or neurogenesis by WGCNA, and found related protein series including EMILIN1, PF4 and CD44. In conclusion, our research found that hydrogel supplemented with HPL can be used as a method for SHED in standardized production and can contribute to the clinical application of SHED in cell therapy.",
