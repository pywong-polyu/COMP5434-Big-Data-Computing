The decrease was more relevant when the lockdown period was compared to both the corresponding time period of 2019 (\u2206%: -78.0), and to the pre-lockdown period (\u2206%: -79.0). The lowest number of ED visits in May 2019 might be due to the beginning of the warm season, even though, after May, there is a slight increase in the number of ED visits, consistent with the spread of some viruses (e.g., enteroviruses) in this season. Conversely, in the year 2020, the temporal trend of ED visits showed a marked reduction occurring as early as March-April months, and a slight and gradual increase during May-June. The lowest number of ED visits in April 2020 is consistent with the effect of the lockdown measures, which started one month before.",

The delayed access to healthcare can be especially detrimental to children with special needs, who are at higher risk of severe illness. In the UK and Ireland, Lynn et al. [9] showed that the most common delayed ED presentations were sepsis, diabetes mellitus, and malignancies. On the other hand, the extreme reduction of ED visits (e.g., the inappropriate ones) allowed a better healthcare organization [15] .",
