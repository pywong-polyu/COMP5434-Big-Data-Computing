According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 6 July 2020), COVID-19 has affected over 11, 327,790 people and has killed 532,340 people in more than 200 countries worldwide [1] . A study found that similar to the SARS-induced psychological burden [2] , anxiety symptom levels increased when COVID-19 occurred in China [3] . Moreover, initial studies indicated a major mental health burden among the public, increased depressive symptoms, decreased sleep quality, and elevated anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak [3] [4] [5] . In this regard, a study in China revealed that stress, anxiety, and depression were more prevalent among students and healthcare professionals in comparison with other professions [6] . Moreover, another study showed that Chinese young people and those who spent more time thinking about COVID-19 were more at risk [3] . The probable cause of mental health problems during the coronavirus pandemic could be related to the \"hypochondria concerns\" theory that means being worried about being infected [7] . According to a Spanish study, it could also be related to important life changes in a very short period of time, including changes in financial or occupational status, restrictions on movement, and cancelation of important activities [8] .",

According to the latest Ministry of Health nationwide study regarding mental health disorders in Iran in 2015, about 23.4% of the population were suspected to suffer from a kind of mental disorder.

It has also been estimated that around 4% of the population had an anxiety disorder [16] . In addition, stress has been classified as the health epidemic of the twenty-first century by the WHO [17] . Stress has been defined as the body's response to painful situations that cause discomfort, which can lead to depression and health problems [18] . In Iran, limited research has been conducted in this field among the general population. The results of a study conducted among the people aged 18 years in Tehran (2017) showed that more than 80% of the people had experienced at least one severe episode of stress during the past year [19] . The results of another study conducted on 10,000 adult residents of Yazd Province revealed that 34.8% of the people had experienced stress [20] . Furthermore, previous research showed that college students had experienced high levels of stress. Studies have also reported some levels of stress and anxiety among students in China (74.3%), Saudi Arabia (63.5%), Bangladesh (61%), and Egypt (59.9%) [21] [22] [23] [24] . A case report performed in Iran also indicated that 83% of the students had experienced stress [25] . The most common stressors among the students were parental expectations, university/life balance, financial/work balance, living away from home, sleeping difficulties, and academic issues [26, 27] .",

It was also stated that stigma, discrimination, and ignorance prevented people from receiving treatment and care [10] . Therefore, societies should provide people with an easy, inexpensive, affordable, and reliable way to access medical services remotely. Digital technology initiatives, such as m-Health, could be helpful in this regard. M-Health refers to the utilization of mobile phones and other wireless technologies in medical care. Some studies have shown evidence supporting the effect of m-Health on different fields of health [33] [34] [35] . The good news is that from more than 15,000 mobile apps, at least 29% have been designed in the field of mental health [36] . The bad news is that a small number of apps are evidence-based [37] . Besides, a study that appraised mental health apps showed that only few of them could be personalized [38] . Moreover, the results of a study demonstrated that more than 50% of students reported low levels of eHealth literacy [39] . Therefore, users have to be empowered to use digital technologies effectively.",

In this context, mental health support should be provided and continued for all people, especially the vulnerable groups. Such support should include accurate information as well as training of suitable coping strategies to manage the situation. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate an evidence-based web application (Naranj) for stress management among Iranian college students during the COVID-19 outbreak.

It has been hypothesized that the web application can reduce the stress level and improve the sleep quality among the target college students. It will also promote students' healthy behaviors. Considering the fact that mental health services are limited in developing countries, many people cannot access fair resources, and only few applications developed in this field are evidence-based. Therefore, this theorybased web application is expected to be a promising tool to help students in Iran. To avoid the risk of contamination between the intervention and control groups, the web application will be available only to the intervention group by putting all intervention group participants in a white list and registering them in the web application. Then, web application registration will be disabled temporarily during the intervention, so that it cannot be used by anyone else. Overall, the study results will indicate an important step towards developing a technology platform for delivering a range of psychosocial strategies for managing stress and sleep problems.",
