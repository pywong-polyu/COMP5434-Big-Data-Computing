Data from China thus far have shown that cancer patients infected with COVID-19 have a 3.5 times higher risk of requiring mechanical ventilation or ICU admission than the general population [1] . The reason for the poor prognosis among these groups of patients is secondary immunodeficiency and, as a result, a decrease or absence of a pathogen-specific adaptive immune response to viral infection, which is necessary for the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 [2] . Thus, providing care to immunocompromised patients and those suffering from cancer amidst this pandemic has been extremely challenging. Aggressive combinations of immunosuppressive therapy are an additional factor that may worsen patient prognosis in a severe course of COVID-19 [3, 4] .",

A CT scan revealed signs of polysegmental bilateral viral pneumonia with 60 % damage and multiple areas of ground glass opacity of perebronchial and subpleural areas (Fig. 1) . SARS-CoV-2 was positive again in throat swab. On day +145, tocilizumab was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg, and the dose of methylprednisolone was increased up to 1 mg/kg. Signs of severe secondary immune deficiency after HSCT, namely, the absence of T and B cell compartments and, accordingly, agammaglobulinemia, were considered serious problems. In addition, the situation was exacerbated by the need for immunosuppressive therapy to control GVHD. Thus, the possibility for a specific intrinsic immune response to SARS-CoV-2 remained extremely poor. To slow the progression of respiratory failure, a dose of fresh frozen plasma (10 mL/kg) obtained from a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient (apheresis, pathogen inactivated with riboflavin + UV; titer of specific SARS-Cov-2Ab -1:160) was administered on day+146. Marked improvement in the lung lesions was revealed on CT after 14 days, and these findings were also accompanied by a normalization of the patient's clinical condition. Later, another 2 transfusions of FFP obtained from different SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors were performed (10 mL/kg; pathogen inactivated with riboflavin + UV; titers of specific Cov-2Ab -1:160 and 1:80), and full resolution of the lung lesions on CT was achieved (Fig. 2 ). An assessment of IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 was performed 5 days after the last convalescent donor FFP transfusion with chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (ARCHITECT, Abbott, USA), and a positive result with 5,47 S/C was detected (the cutoff is 1.40 index S/C).",

It is commonly believed that viral agents are associated with an increased risk of a more severe disease course and respiratory complications in immunocompromised patients [3, 12] . According to data published by Minotti C et al., the prognosis of adults and children receiving immunosuppressive therapy with new COVID-19 infections is more favorable than that of patients with other comorbid conditions [4] . Indeed, the severe respiratory complications caused by coronaviruses are thought to be driven by aberrant inflammatory and cytokine responses perpetuated by the host immune system [2] . This may be a possible explanation for the milder course of COVID-19 in patients with impaired immune responses and the virtual absence of a cytokine storm. However, according to a limited meta-analysis conducted by Gao Y et al., immunosuppressive therapy and immunodeficiency were associated with a more severe course of COVID-19 [11] . This is likely a consequence of severe progressive uncontrolled damage of the lung parenchyma caused primarily by a viral (SARS-CoV-2) agent, not by cytokines.",

            "text": "Moreover, hematopoietic stem cell recipients represent a very special population of patients. An adaptive specific immune response to infection is formed 4-6 months after allogeneic HSCT and may even be delayed in the case of GVHD and immunosuppressive therapy. Thus, the lack of an immune reconstitution and persistence of secondary immunodeficiency can lead to the severe course and poor prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viral infections after HSCT. Additionally, it should be noted that the timing of the clinical manifestations of lung insufficiency in patients with severe immune deficiencies may significantly differ from the course of COVID-19 in immunocompetent patients, whose own inflammatory response in the early stages is most likely to be the pathophysiology of lung damage. In our case, the development of respiratory failure was diagnosed only 43 days after the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and this may be indirect evidence that lesions in the pulmonary interstitium caused by a replicating virus may play a major role in developing a severe course of COVID-19. A low probability of the patient forming her own immune response became the argument for starting therapy with hyperimmune SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in combination with other therapeutic options, despite the lack of published data on similar experiences in the pediatric cohort. A complete clinical response to therapy was reported in a few days, and the patient had no clinical manifestations of the infection 4 months after the first detection of SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, complete elimination of SARS-CoV-2 has not been achieved, which is due to the lack of reconstitution of the adaptive immune response. This was confirmed by the absence of B-cells according to flow cytometry, as well as lack of SARS-CoV-2specific T-cells according to IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT test result. Consider this, we cannot exclude the risk of reactivation of the disease after prolonged persistence of the virus in this patient due to long-term immunodeficiency.",

Convalescent plasma with high titers of pathogen-specific antibodies can play a crucial role that cannot be ignored while treating patients with no prospects for the formation of an adaptive response to the pathogen. In our opinion, this kind of therapy should be discussed as a curative option for this group of high-risk patients.",

The inability to develop an adaptive immune response in patients with severe immune deficiency can be a predictor of a poor prognosis for COVID-19. Convalescent plasma therapy is one of the possible and effective options in such a clinical situation in pediatric practice.",
