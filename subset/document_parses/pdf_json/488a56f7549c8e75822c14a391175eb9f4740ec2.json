Based on fear appeal theories, this research proposed a chain reaction model that links physical distance to the nearest patients, which is informed by the location information of patients, citizens' anxiety, attention to information and preventive behaviors. To test the hypothesized model, we conducted a study during the COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China in March 2020. The survey of 2061 people from 244 cities across 30 provinces showed that physical distance to confirmed cases has a significant influence on citizens' anxiety, which in turn can improve their preventive behaviors through the mediating factor of attention to information. In addition, this research also revealed the twofold effects of vertical collectivism as a personality trait on anxiety. These findings will provide support to help governments take actions to reduce citizens' anxiety and promote preventive behaviors.",

On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic (WHO, 2020) . During this crisis, many countries have taken decisive actions. For example, China sealed off Wuhan city on January 23 and shut down public transport in eight other cities to minimize the spread of the virus near the epicenter (Tuo et al., 2020) . Moreover, to better control the pandemic, governments worldwide have imposed social distancing by closing schools or public places, cancelling mass events, and promoting remote work (Bayham & Fenichel, 2020) . Unprecedented actions have dramatically altered the public's ordinary lives, causing fears and influencing the behavior of people everywhere (Rochadi et al., 2020) .",

Especially for uninfected people, the location information of patients nearest where they live is important information that has considerable impacts on their emotions, attention to information, and behaviors during pandemics. For example, during the H5N1 pandemic, people at a shorter physical distance to confirmed cases showed a higher degree of negative affect, such as panic (Manabe et al., 2012) . The first reported local COVID-19 case can induce local citizens' attention to pandemic information (Bento et al., 2020) . In addition, during outbreaks of avian influenza, citizens who are informed of local outbreaks adopt more preventive behaviors (Kuo et al., 2011) .",

For example, based on fear appeal theories, Du et al. (2020) found that increased information about prevalence rates of COVID-19 was associated with more searches for protective behaviors of the public, and Scopelliti et al. (2021) emphasized that moderate levels of fear have increased the public's preventive behaviors in the use of public spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we believe that fear appeal theories can also help us explore the effects of information about the location of patients.",

Fear appeal theories include two predominant theoretical frameworks: protection motivation theory (PMT) and the extended parallel process model (EPPM) (Ruiter et al., 2014) . PMT proposes four message factors of information: (a) the magnitude of noxiousness of a depicted event; (b) the probability of occurrence; (c) response efficacy depictions; and (d) self-efficacy depictions (Rogers, 1975; Maddux & Rogers, 1983) . The above four factors will influence individuals' attitude changes (i.e., intent to adopt a recommended response) through cognitive mediating processes of their perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived efficacy of coping response and perceived self-efficacy, as well as protection motivation (Rogers, 1975; Maddux & Rogers, 1983) .",

For example, So (2013) proposed an extension of the extended parallel process model (E-EPPM), which incorporates a more comprehensive perspective on risk perceptions as a construct involving both cognitive and affective aspects (i.e., fear and anxiety). Through an empirical study, So et al. (2016) proved that a high threat message would induce both fear and anxiety. In addition, they found that anxiety led to a higher level of motivation to obtain information than fear, and paying attention to information was one of the significant predictors of intention to take protective action (So et al., 2016) .",

Furthermore, fear appeal theories also demonstrate that emotions can have an impact on coping appraisals (e.g., motivation to obtain information and to pay attention to information), which can eventually lead to individuals' protective action (So et al., 2016) . Therefore, fear appeal theories can help us to understand the effects of the location information of patients (i.e., physical distance to the nearest patients) released during the COVID-19 pandemic on the anxiety, attention to pandemic information and protective behaviors of individuals, as well as the role of citizens' personality (vertical collectivism) in these relationships.",

The physical distance to the specific threat largely determines its degree of severity and possible negative consequences. Research has demonstrated that people show higher levels of fear and anxiety when they perceive a greater severity or possibility of negative consequences from threat information (Ruiter et al., 2014) . Thus, people's fear or anxiety can be influenced by the physical distance to the threat implied by the threat information. For example, Manabe et al. (2012) found that H5N1 patients present in nearer neighboring areas can lead to higher panic in residents. Qian et al. (2003) also reported that when the spatial distance between SARS cases decreases, people show more negative emotions, such as tension, panic, anger, pessimism and helplessness. A possible reason for this might be that a shorter physical distance to confirmed or suspected cases always implies a greater possibility of contact with these infected neighbors. Because living environments are much closer together, neighbors share a common public activity space. Therefore, the smaller the distance is, the greater the possibility of infection, which leads to higher anxiety.",

As this outbreak of COVID-19 coincided with Chinese New Year, many people stayed home with their families during this period of the pandemic . Therefore, staying home was more acceptable for people with a high level of vertical collectivism than for people with a low level of vertical collectivism.

Participants who reported \"not sure\" were deleted from the final data analysis. We adopted this method for several reasons. First, this research focused on the effects of the location information of patients. However, the availability of and attention to this information are different for individuals, and subjective distance predicts an individual's interaction better than objective distance (Siebdrat et al., 2014) . Hence, we asked the participants to report distances themselves. Second, because the participants might not be able to give an accurate estimation of distance, we provided interval distance data to the participants and let them choose what they think is the best. Third, although we claimed that physical distance from patients is negatively related to citizens' anxiety, this relationship should not be linear. For example, controlling for other possible influencing factors, citizens living 1 km away from patients were very likely to have higher levels of anxiety than citizens living 5 km away from patients. However, citizens living 26 km away from patients will likely have a similar level of anxiety as those living 30 km away from patients, although their distance differences are both 4 km. Previous studies will standardize physical distance values by using log transformation of objective distance (e.g., Siebdrat et al., 2014) . Thus, instead of using an equidistant scale, we used a scale with increasing spacing, which is nearly in line with log transformation.",

According to the results of the simple slope test, which is shown in Fig. 2 , the relationship between physical distance and citizens' anxiety was stronger when citizens' vertical collectivism was higher (b = \u2212.14, p < .001) than when it was lower (b = \u2212.08, p < .001).

Only accurate information can guide citizens to engage in the correct preventive behaviors and avoid maladaptive behaviors such as unnecessary trips to emergency rooms or the overuse of other emergency health resources (Basch et al., 2020b) . For example, the Chinese government has established rumor modules on social media platforms, such as Weibo and WeChat, to eliminate rumors and incorrect preventive behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

            "text": "Although the article synthesizes previous research and investigates the effects of location information of patients on citizens during pandemics based on fear appeal theories, there are still some limitations to the research that need to be resolved by future studies. First, the data we obtained from the survey are cross-sectional, which may lead to the phenomenon of reverse causality in the results (Zhang et al., 2014) . As Maio et al. (2018) stated, attitudes can easily change, and crosssectional data cannot clearly reflect the dynamic relationship trend between these variables. Thus, future longitudinal databased studies would be useful for better identifying clear causal relationships among these constructs. Second, another potential limitation stems from citizens' self-reported measures of their own perceptions, which may contain individual perceptual bias (Scopelliti et al., 2021) . For example, citizens' self-reported distance from the nearest confirmed case might be different from the actual distance. Because this research focused on the effects of location information of patients, the availability of and attention to this information varies among individuals. Thus, we used self-reported rather than objective data to measure distance because it reflects citizens' reception and interpretation of this information and will better predict individuals' reactions (Siebdrat et al., 2014) . However, we still acknowledge this limitation and note that our results should be interpreted in conjunction with more findings from other normative, qualitative, and quantitative studies. Last, because individuals with different preferences for affective and cognitive information will respond to social information differently (Aquino et al., 2020) , and attitudes toward others will influence their information processing and behaviors (Maio et al., 2018) , it is important for future studies to deepen the roles of individual preferences for affective and cognitive information and attitudes in our model.",

This study was based on fear appeal theories and revealed that a shorter physical distance to patients will provoke higher levels of anxiety, thereby leading to more attention being paid to pandemic information and eventually influencing citizens' preventive behaviors. In addition, citizens' personality, such as vertical collectivism, also plays a critical role in this chain reaction, including reducing citizens' anxiety directly and strengthening the impact of physical distance on anxiety. These findings provide significant evidence-based support for governments to use as they engage in measures to reduce citizens' anxiety and improve their preventive behaviors during this pandemic. In addition, this study also offers measures that the government or the public can apply to reduce anxiety and increase preventive behaviors. Although this chain reaction is proven in the context of COVID-19 in China, the use of this model in other countries or regions needs further testing.",
