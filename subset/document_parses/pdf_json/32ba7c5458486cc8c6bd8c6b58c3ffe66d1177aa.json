The prevalence of an abnormal laboratory finding was 171 compared between 1) pregnant patients who were symptomatic versus asymptomatic and 2) 172 symptomatic pregnant patients with mild to moderate disease versus those with severe to critical 173 disease. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests determined biomarker abnormalities significantly 174 associated with symptomatic infection and disease severity. Peak (vs. nadir) laboratory values as 175 well as laboratory values on initial presentation that were significantly associated with 1) 176 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 or 2) severity of symptoms were evaluated with multivariable 177 logistic regression. These multivariable regressions controlled for significant covariates to 178 identify whether the identified laboratory abnormalities were independently associated with 179 either symptoms or more severe illness. 180 The remainder of our analysis involved analysis of only peak (vs. nadir) laboratory 181 values. Sensitivity and specificity of each laboratory abnormality identified in multivariable 182 regression to be a significant predictor of clinical phenotype (i.e. symptomatic versus 183 asymptomatic infection; mild to moderate disease versus severe to critical disease) were calculated. Sensitivity analysis excluding pregnant patients treated with dexamethasone, which is 185 known to contribute to leukocytosis, was also performed for neutrophilia, lymphopenia and 186 leukopenia among pregnant patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection according to 187 disease severity. Of note, at our institution, any patient with a positive COVID test result 188 warranting antenatal corticosteroid administration for fetal benefit received dexamethasone, not 189 betamethasone. Additional sensitivity analyses among symptomatic patients excluded patients 190 who had laboratory assessment during labor or within 48 hours postpartum, as biomarker levels 191 can be altered by physiologic changes intrapartum and immediately postpartum. 192 Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 16.1.844 (College Station, TX). 193 The study was approved by the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine 194 Institutional Review Board (IRB# STU00212232) prior to its initiation and obtained a study period, 175 pregnant patients were identified to have a positive PCR test 199 confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection, of whom 100 (57%) were symptomatic (Figure 1).

Furthermore, Pierce-Williams et al. identified elevated PCT and 332 LDH to be associated with greater disease severity, while Pereira et al. did not find LDH to be 333 associated with disease severity. 25,26 Similar to Pierce-Williams et. al, we identified elevated 334 PCT and LDH for peak laboratory values to be independently associated with more severe 335 disease. Prior studies have not evaluated test characteristics such as the sensitivity and specificity 336 of these biomarkers for risk stratification and prognostication among pregnant individuals with 337 SARS-CoV-2 infection; the poor discriminatory ability of these tests as we have identified 338 among our cohort may account for the variable differences in significant laboratory markers 339 identified in the aforementioned studies. 340 infection nor particularly indicative of disease severity, other clinical applications of these 345 biomarkers remain unclear. Prior studies have commented on the use of elevated D-Dimer levels 346 to guide prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with more severe SARS-COV-2 infection either 347 during inpatient admission or following delivery. 36-39 Additionally, elevated procalcitonin has 348 been demonstrated to be a marker for increased risk of bacterial infection in patients with SARS-349 CoV-2 infection, and more specifically superimposed bacterial pneumonia, that may support 350 antibiotic therapy. 40 However, evaluation of the ability of these inflammatory biomarkers to 351 predict coagulopathy or bacterial superinfection and guide treatment in pregnant patients is 352 beyond the scope of this manuscript. Future studies should further evaluate the clinical 353 applications of inflammatory biomarkers in pregnant patients with SARS-CoVis strengthened by the diverse patient population and comprehensive array of 358 inflammatory biomarkers evaluated. Our results are likely generalizable to other pregnant 359individuals in the U.S. Additionally, our large cohort afforded us the ability to control for 360 potential confounders, notably gestational age at diagnosis, maternal age and presence of obesity. 361Each of these factors could influence the laboratory values assessed. 362",

In additional sensitivity analysis among 265 symptomatic patients excluding those who had laboratory assessment done intrapartum or 266 postpartum, only an elevated PCT (aOR 10.85, 95% CI 1.44-81.88) and an elevated LDH (aOR 267 8.90, 95% CI 1.06-75.10) were significantly associated with severe to critical disease; 268 transaminitis was no longer significantly associated with disease severity (OR 3.0, 95% CI 0.57-269In our cohort of 175 pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identified a 274 relatively low, but clinically important subset of patients with severe and critical disease (17%).observed vast heterogeneity in measured biomarker levels among pregnant patients with SARS-277CoV-2 infection even within cohorts (e.g. among those who were asymptomatic or among those 278 with mild to moderate disease). This pronounced heterogeneity decreases the discriminatory 279 strength of any one specific inflammatory marker to differentiate clinical phenotypes of disease. 280Of all inflammatory markers analyzed, only hsCRP was independently associated with 281 symptomatic disease. However, 55% of people with asymptomatic disease had an abnormally 282 elevated hsCRP, making the specificity of this as a discriminatory test clinically not useful. 283Among symptomatic pregnant patients, elevated liver enzymes, PCT, and LDH for peak 284 laboratory values were all significantly associated with severe or critical disease. Transaminitis 285 and LDH both demonstrated poor performance as a screening test with high false negative rates, 286 but demonstrated greater diagnostic ability for distinguishing severe to critical disease from mild 287 to moderate disease with specificity approaching 89-90%. Elevated peak PCT demonstrated 288 improved performance as a screening test, but poor performance as a diagnostic test for more 289 severe disease as reflected by the test sensitivity and specificity. Overall, the discriminatory 290 ability of these laboratory tests to distinguish disease severity in symptomatic pregnant patients 291 is poor and suggests they have limited utility in clinical practice. 292While the obstetric literature on inflammatory biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 295 infection demonstrates mixed results, several studies evaluating nonpregnant individuals with 296 SARS-CoV-2 infection have noted elevated D-dimer levels, neutrophil counts, ferritin, liver 297 enzymes, LDH and CRP levels as well as decreased lymphocyte counts to have utility in",
