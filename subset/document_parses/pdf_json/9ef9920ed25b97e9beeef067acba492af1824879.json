Preliminary reports suggested a low early postvaccination antibody response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The aim of this study was to focus on the specific T-cell response. We quantified S1-specific IgG, neutralizing antibody titers, total specific IFNgsecreting T cells by ELISpot, and functionality of CD4 + -and CD8 + -specific T cells by flow cytometry, after two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine in younger and older people, with and without previous COVID-19 infection (hereafter referred to as COVID-19-recovered and COVID-19-naive subjects, respectively). Frailty, nutritional, and immunosenescence parameters were collected at baseline in COVID-19-naive older people. We analyzed the immune response in 129 young adults (median age 44.0 years) and 105 older residents living in a LCTF (median age 86.5 years), 3 months after the first injection. Humoral and cellular memory responses were dramatically impaired in the COVID-19-naive older (n = 54) compared with the COVID-19-naive younger adults (n = 121). Notably, older participants' neutralizing antibodies were 10 times lower than the younger's antibody titers (p < 0.0001) and LCTF residents also had an impaired functional T-cell response: the frequencies of IFNg + and IFNg + IL-2 + TNFa + cells among specific CD4 + T cells, and the Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org",

The aim of this study was to focus on the specific T-cell response. We quantified S1-specific IgG, neutralizing antibody titers, total specific IFNgsecreting T cells by ELISpot, and functionality of CD4 + -and CD8 + -specific T cells by flow cytometry, after two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine in younger and older people, with and without previous COVID-19 infection (hereafter referred to as COVID-19-recovered and COVID-19-naive subjects, respectively). Frailty, nutritional, and immunosenescence parameters were collected at baseline in COVID-19-naive older people. We analyzed the immune response in 129 young adults (median age 44.0 years) and 105 older residents living in a LCTF (median age 86.5 years), 3 months after the first injection. Humoral and cellular memory responses were dramatically impaired in the COVID-19-naive older (n = 54) compared with the COVID-19-naive younger adults (n = 121). Notably, older participants' neutralizing antibodies were 10 times lower than the younger's antibody titers (p < 0.0001) and LCTF residents also had an impaired functional T-cell response: the frequencies of IFNg + and IFNg + IL-2 + TNFa + cells among specific CD4 + T cells, and the",

Considered among the most at risk of developing severe COVID-19, long-term care facility (LTCF) older residents were among the first to be vaccinated. In addition to age, older adults usually cumulate other risk factors for COVID-19 and death, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and/or malignancy (1) . Furthermore, the closed environment and the relative inability of residents to adopt preventive health measures led to numerous outbreaks in LTCFs worldwide (1) . For these reasons, there were high hopes for anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, especially among the older and healthcare workers (HCW) in LTCFs. However, the older display physiological alterations of cellular and humoral immunity that affect vaccine responses (2, 3) , and, due to their age and frailty, they were not included in clinical trials evaluating the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (4) (5) (6) (7) .",

Frailty was assessed with the Clinical Frailty Scale as proposed by Rockwood et al. (9) and using the Fried frailty phenotype criteria (10) . All participants received the two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination at a 3-week dosing interval: the first dose was administered at Day 0 (D0) and the second dose between D21 and D28.

At D90, S1 IgG reactivity was detected in almost all participants in both groups (99.2% of younger and 97.2% of older adults), but the median titer of anti-S1 IgG antibodies was two times lower among the older residents (p < 0.001) ( Figure 3A) . The difference was greater for neutralizing antibodies, with a geometric mean of 50% serum neutralization titer (NT50) Figure 3C ). The mean NT50 in each group was consistent with the PV-NT50 assay (Supplementary Figure S2) . Regarding cellular response, T cells reactive to the S1 subunit detected by ELISpot were less frequent in the older than in the younger group (13.5 [25.0-27.57] versus 29.5 [15.0; 46.5], respectively) (p = 0.002) ( Figure 3D ). To confirm our results, all acquired parameters were correlated with age in COVID-19-naive young and older participants. Age negatively correlated with anti-S1 IgG, neutralizing antibody titers, and count of specific IFNg-secreting T cells, which support the differences observed between the two groups ( Figure 3E ). There were also strong positive correlations between the immune parameters, which highlights both the conserved links between these different adaptive responses among the older population, and the robustness of the chosen approaches ( Figure 3E and Table 2 ).",

We observed no significant difference in the rate of participants with detectable AIM + CD4 + T cells between the COVID-19-naive young and older adults according to stimulation index (89.8% versus 97.9%, respectively, p > 0.05) and similar frequency of AIM + CD4 + among CD4 + T cell in both groups ( Figures 5A,  B) . Conversely, the frequencies of CD4 + effector cells differed ( Figure 5C ): the amount of specific AIM + IFNg + and AIM + IFNg + IL-2 + TNFa + (triple + ) CD4 + T cells were lower in COVID-19-naive older participants than in COVID-19-naive young adults ( Figure 5D ). Of note, AIM + IFNg + CD4 + T-cell counts detected by flow cytometry correlated very well with IFNg-secreting T-cell counts in ELISpot, confirming the robustness of our ELISPot assay to assess the T-cell response (Spearman's coefficient r [95% CI] = 0.47 [0.34-0.59]; p < 0.0001; available pairs: n = 151). Regarding anti-S1specific CD8 + T cells, more COVID-19-naive young participants developed AIM + CD8 + T cells than COVID-19naive older adults (76.4% versus 48.0%, respectively, p = 0.0018) ( Figure 6A ), but the frequency of AIM + CD8 + among total CD8 + T cells was similar in responders of both groups ( Figure 6B) . We also noted that, in the COVID-19naive population, the frequency of AIM + IL-2 + CD8 + T cells was greater among the older than among the younger, but frequencies of IFNg + , TNFa + , or triple + CD8 + T cells were not different ( Figures 6C, D) . Figure 3C ). In addition, after two vaccine doses, the anti-S1 IgG ( Figure 3A) , the neutralizing antibody levels ( Figure 3B ), IFNg-secreting T-cell counts in ELISpot ( Figure 3D) , AIM + IFNg + CD4 + and AIM + triple + CD4 + frequencies ( Figures 5C, D) , total AIM + CD8 + T cells ( Figure 6B) , and AIM + TNFa + CD8 + T-cell frequencies ( Figures 4C, D) increased to a greater extent among COVID-19-recovered older adults compared with COVID-19-naive older adults.",

Our results are in line with earlier evaluations of antibody response after a first dose (9, 10) and between 14 and 28 days after the second one (17) (18) (19) (20) , indicating a poorer response in the older people.

Our work also shows that specific IFNg + and triple + CD4 + T cells, and specific TNFa + CD8 + T cells, the latter being the most important in antiviral defense, were also highly boosted in participants who had a prior COVID-19 infection.

We are also able to discuss the higher immunogenicity of BNT162b vaccine in older people with previous COVID-19, not only considering the antibody response, but also the T-cell response and its functionality. Our study is, however, limited in that, due to the recommendations applied in France at the time of the study, we were unable to assess whether a single dose of this vaccine after exposure to COVID-19 would have generated a sufficient response in these individuals. Also, the relatively short follow-up period only allowed us to assess the short-term effects of the vaccine. However, these data on the 2-month residual immune memory after the second dose may help anticipate future needs to adapt the vaccination strategy among the older.",

Recent studies showed only a slightly lower immunogenicity after two doses with the delta variant that is currently responsible of a large majority of COVID-19 cases in many countries. We can suppose that the reduced immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 vaccine among older people may be similar or lower for the delta variant. For this reason, some countries have recently decided to recommend a third dose in older people and not only in immunocompromised patients. Our study illustrates that, even if the ability to respond to neoantigens A B FIGURE 7 | Unsupervised analysis of CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell functionality in older participants using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).
