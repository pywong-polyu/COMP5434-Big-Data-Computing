Meanwhile, peak inspiratory flow V I ) of patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure can reach up to 120 L/min, largely exceeding HFO flow. Currently, very few data on the reliability of HFO devices at these high V I are available. We sought to evaluate factors affecting oxygenation while using HFO systems at high V I in a bench study. Spontaneous breathing was generated with a mechanical test lung connected to a mechanical ventilator Servo-i\u00ae, set to volume control mode. Gas flow from a HFO device was delivered to the test lung. The influence on effective inspired oxygen fraction of three parameters (F iO2 0.6, 0.8, and 1, V I from 28 to 98.1 L/min, and HFO Gas Flows from 40 to 60 L/min) were analyzed and are reported. The present bench study demonstrates that during HFO treatment, measured F iO2 in the lung does not equal set F iO2 on the device. The substance of this variation (\u0394F iO2 ) is tightly correlated to V I (Pearson's coefficient of 0.94, p-value < 0.001). Additionally, set F iO2 and Flow at HFO device appear to significatively affect \u0394F iO2 as well (p-values < 0.001, adjusted to V I ). The result of multivariate linear regression indicates predictors ( V I , Flow and set F iO2 ) to explain 92% of the variance of delta F iO2 through K-Fold Cross Validation. Moreover, adjunction of a dead space in the breathing circuit significantly decreased \u0394F iO2 (p < 0.01). The present bench study did expose a weakness of HFO devices in reliability of delivering accurate F IO2 at high V I as well as, to a lesser extent, at V I below equivalent set HFO Flows. Moreover, set HFO flow and set F IO2 did influence the variability of effective inspired oxygen fraction. The adjunction of a dead space in the experimental set-up significantly amended this variability and should thus be further studied in order to improve success rate of HFO therapy.",

The HFO devices are described as capable of delivering reliable, reproducible and accurate F iO2 from 0.21 to 1.0 with flows between 20 and 60 L/min [3, 4] . Hypoxemic critically ill patients do benefit the most of high flow oxygen devices and present with high Minute Ventilation ( V E ) and consequently high peak inspiratory flows ( V I ) [5] . This is especially the case of critically ill patients due to the Coronavirus 2019 disease (SARS-CoV-2). Indeed, despite severe pulmonary damage, the latter patients can maintain quite normal elastic-resistive thoraco-pulmonary characteristics during the first week of respiratory failure [6] thus being often capable of maintaining high V E and V I during a prolonged time [7] . In some cases, the peak inspiratory flow of patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure can even reach up to 120 L/min [8] , largely exceeding HFO flow. At these high V I , the assumption is made that atmospheric room air might enter the breathing circuit and dilute the set F iO2 from HFO [3] reducing consequently the effectively delivered F IO2 .",

To simulate physiological conditions, i.e. open mouth or inevitable leaks around the nasal cannula, a T-piece was mounted in the experimental set up. F iO2 measurements at the T-piece present oscillation of up to 10% in F iO2 through the respiratory cycle in comparison with oscillations of up to 4% of \"intra-pulmonary\" measurements ( Fig. 1) . This first finding demonstrates presence of air blending in this part of the circuit, that stabilizes when arriving in the lungs. Analysis in the present study was therefore carried out on stabilized intra-pulmonary F iO2 measurements, as recommended by the manufacturer of the Dual Test Lung. Through the analysis of these measurements, important differences were found between sFiO 2 and mF iO2 (sF iO2 -mF iO2 = \u0394F iO2 ) at different V I , Flow and set F iO2 . V I was the most significant variable influencing \u0394F iO2 and exerted a positive linear relation with the latter. This finding accentuates the purpose of our study which assessed the effects of high V E and V I while other studies did limit this variable to physiologic \"resting\" values [3] .",

With the formula of this principle, we simulated and depicted in Fig. 6 the relationship of F iO2 calculated through different sF iO2 at different Air Flows. Air Flow in this simulation illustrates the flow arising from the suction effect during either assumed Bernoulli effect either V I exceeding HFO Flow. As the mean difference in V between trunk and without trunk is statistically significant (p < 0.01) with Tukey's adjusted p-values and set HFO Flow was of 13L/min in our experiment, we choose to represent Air Flows of 5, 12.5 and 20 L/min. In this simulation, we see that the lower sF iO2 , the less it will be affected by room air blending, and thus, the difference in sF iO2 and calculated F iO2 will remain small. In the same way, the higher the Air Flow, the more air blending occurs, and thus, increasing difference between sF iO2 and calculated F iO2 . This is in accordance with our findings that higher sF iO2 and lower HFO flows tend to augment \u0394F iO2 . Clinical applications of our findings are important. Indeed, how sicker the patients, the more important V I and the need of high F iO2 , the less reliable F iO2 delivery from HFO become. The only parameter limiting differences in sF iO2 and actual F iO2 in patients with high V I seem to be the flow rate at HFO device. We could therefore suggest augmenting flow in these patients before trying to augment F iO2 to diminish room-air suction effect of patients with major peak inspiratory flow. The use of devices with the ability to deliver higher Flows could also be determinant in assuring reliable F iO2 to patients with high V I . Another objective of our study was to analyze the effect of the adjunction of a dead space in the circuit. The addition of a tube ISO 22 of 30 cm of length (0.230 L) on the T-piece did significantly decrease \u0394F iO2 . This could be explained by the fact that during expiration, high oxygenated air from HFO will be contained in the dead spaces (mouth, surgical mask or Double Trunk Mask). According to the air-mixing theorem, during inspiration, with Inspiratory Flow above HFO Flow, instead of room air at a fraction of 0.21 of oxygen, air at higher oxygen fractions will blend with high oxygenated air from HFO, thus limiting \u0394F iO2 . Hence, adjunction of a dead space (Double Trunk Mask or equivalent) could also be a promising premise to enhance HFO therapy as it was already clinically demonstrated [13, 14] and should be further studied.",

In clinical practice it is difficult to appreciate actual V E and estimate the T i on total respiratory cycle time (T i + T e ) ratio which determine mean inspiratory flow and could help estimating peak inspiratory flow. Furthermore, as it is a bench study, the clinical consequences can only be hypothesized and warrant further in vivo research. Our model does not exactly reproduce three-dimensional anatomy of the upper airways. Nevertheless, in physiological situation, we expect less ideal gas flows than our experimental design. Hence, we expect more turbulent flows in patient's upper airways, which only can augment our estimate \u0394F iO2 through amplifying air blending.",

Until further in vivo research of stability and reliability of effective inspired oxygen fraction during HFO treatment, we advocate to use sF IO2 with caution in severity scores and scores predicting the need for intubation.",
