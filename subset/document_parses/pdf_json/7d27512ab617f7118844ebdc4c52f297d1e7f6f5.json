Using a panel of 158 countries between 1960 and 2010, we find that the correlation of growth with poverty is consistently negative: A 10 p.p. decrease in the headcount poverty rate is associated with a subsequent increase in per capita GDP between 0.5 and 1.2% per year. In contrast, the correlation of growth with inequality is empirically fragile-it can be positive or negative, depending on the empirical specification and econometric approach employed. However, the indirect effect of inequality on growth through its correlation with poverty is robustly negative. Closer inspection shows that these results are driven by the sample observations featuring high poverty rates.",

The effects of poverty have been analyzed by numerous theoretical papers highlighting a variety of mechanisms through which poverty may become selfperpetuating. But empirical work has been more limited and largely inconclusive. Indeed, a basic implication of the theoretical models of poverty traps-namely, that countries suffering from higher levels of poverty should grow less rapidly than comparable countries with lower poverty-has been largely overlooked. This is the key hypothesis pursued in this paper. It can be viewed as a weak version of the poverty trap hypothesis, in that to support it we do not need to find evidence of multiple equilibria or income stagnation, but just empirical proof that, other things equal, poverty tends to hold back growth.",

Further inspection reveals the presence of nonlinearities, in that these results are driven by the sample observations featuring high poverty: when poverty is low, its impact on growth is not significant, and the indirect effect of inequality on growth is therefore absent. We reach a similar conclusion when we let the growth impact of poverty differ between developed and developing countries: It is negative and significant for the latter, but not for the former.",

Malnutrition provides another example. In developing countries, poverty is associated with high rates of malnutrition (Dasgupta and Ray 1986), which impacts cognitive abilities and school absenteeism and is transmitted to the children's capacity to learn.

For instance, the poor devote a significant fraction of their income to satisfying basic needs (Shah et al. 2012) and to \"temptation\" goods (Banerjee and Mullainathan 2010) and reduce the resources devoted to education, health and investment.

A broader empirical review of different mechanisms advanced in the literature finds little evidence that they may be at work, except perhaps in remote or disadvantaged areas (Kraay and McKenzie 2014) . More recently, large-scale randomized evaluations, such as the one developed by Bandiera et al.

Voitchovsky (2005) and, more recently, van der Weide and Milanovic (2018) argue that the effect of inequality is negative for the income growth of the poor but positive for the income growth of the rich-i.e., inequality tends to be self-reinforcing. The effects of inequality on growth might also depend on the sectoral structure of the economy (Erman and te Kaat 2019) and on the degree of intergenerational mobility (Aiyar and Ebeke 2020). 6 In general, different mechanisms affecting growth in opposite directions through different channels act all simultaneously, leading to conflicting inferences.

We complete the WIID2 data with information from PovcalNet, which adds another 122 country-year (16 countries) observations over the 1960-2010 period. In a number of instances, there are multiple surveys referring to the same country-year, but they offer different coverage or use different concepts of income. We restrict our sample to Gini indexes based on nationally representative surveys. Moreover, data are sometimes based on income and other times on expenditure figures; income is net of transfers and taxes in some cases and not in others; the unit of analysis may be the individual or the household, etc. To correct at least in part for this heterogeneity, we adjust the original Gini data following Dollar and Kraay (2002) . 8 For economic growth, we use national accounts purchasing-power-parity (PPP)adjusted per capita GDP data from the Penn World Tables 7.1, the same source used by Berg et al. (2018) and many other studies of inequality and growth, which facilitates comparability with them. Sala-i-Martin (2006) and Dollar and Kraay (2002) , among many others, emphasize the advantages of using per capita GDP instead of the mean level of income obtained directly from household surveys. The survey mean usually does not match per capita income from the national accounts, because of differences in concepts and methodology, inconsistent data collection methods, misreporting, etc. Additionally, for many of the country-year observations for which we have information on inequality, we do not have matching information on mean income from the same source, which hampers the construction of a large panel dataset. In contrast, national accounts data are reported yearly for all countries, using a homogenous methodology, which, in addition, allows us to compare our empirical results with those of the ample macroeconomic literature on income inequality and growth.",

These authors point out that combining poverty and income growth data from household surveys and national accounts may lead to misleading conclusions, because of the inconsistencies between the two sources just noted. To avoid this problem, they use PWT data to construct both income growth and poverty measures, with the latter computed assuming that household income follows a lognormal distribution. Thus, we construct a set of poverty measures (the headcount ratio P0, the poverty gap P1 and the squared poverty gap P2) using a lognormal approximation on the basis of the observed per capita GDP levels and Gini coefficients. 9 We also 8 Specifically, we pool the sample and regress the Gini coefficient on a constant, regional dummies and dummy variables indicating whether the survey is stated in terms of gross income or consumption (the omitted category is income net of taxes and transfers). We then subtract the estimated mean difference between these two alternatives and the omitted category to arrive at a set of Gini indices that notionally correspond to the distribution of income net of taxes and transfers. The results of these adjustment regressions are available upon request, but they show similar conclusions as in Dollar and Kraay (2002) . 9 The UN-WIID2 Gini index is not always available for the first year of each 5-year interval. In such cases, we allocate the available observation(s) to the closest starting year of a 5-year interval, with a limit of 2 years experiment with alternative, widely used poverty lines: US$ 1.25, US$ 2 and US$ 4 per person per day, in 2005 PPP US$ (see Appendix 1 for details).",

Despite the progress made in recent years, mainly through the PovcalNet project, survey-based poverty data are still relatively scarce, at least in comparison with the size of the standard crosscountry time-series growth dataset. Using the lognormal approximation, we assemble 746 observations on poverty over non-overlapping 5-year intervals, covering 156 countries between 1960 and 2005 (an average of almost five observations per country). 10 In contrast, using the January 2020 version of PovcalNet over the same 1960-2005 time span, we can construct a dataset of 383 poverty observations over non-overlapping 5-year intervals for 144 countries, roughly half the size of our sample-i.e., an average of less than 3 observations per country, with data for the vast majority of countries starting in 1990 or later. 11 As far as we are aware, ours is the largest sample used to date to study the impact of poverty on growth. It exceeds by far the samples used by the two earlier papers analyzing the poverty-growth nexus in a panel regression setting: L\u00f3pez and Serv\u00e9n (2015) assemble a sample comprising 325 observations from 85 countries over 1960 , while Ravallion (2012 (Luxembourg in 2005) .

The maximum value (above 0.74) corresponds to Footnote 9 continued of difference. When more than one observation is available within the 2-year limit, we take the average. Because of the strong inertia of inequality and poverty time series, using a 1-year limit instead of 2 years, or not using means, yields very similar results (Dollar and Kraay 2002) . 10 Our data comprise 121 data points corresponding to 32 low-income countries, 180 to 41 lower-middle income countries, 240 to 44 upper-middle income, 57 to 11 high-income non-OECD, and 206 to 30 highincome OCDE countries. The sample includes 18 observations (2 countries) from North America, 248 (48 countries) from Europe and Central Asia, 159 (28 countries) from Latin American and the Caribbean, 53 (12 countries) from Middle East and North Africa, 144 (40 countries) from Sub-Saharan Africa, 56 (9 countries) from South Asia and 126 (19 countries) from East Asia and the Pacific. 11 This sample size would be too small for many of our exercises, and thus for the robustness tests using PovcalNet data reported in Section V below, we resort to the interpolated PovcalNet series, which allows increasing the sample size to 556 observations. These interpolated information start in 1981 and are reported every three years. Thus, to construct a non-overlapping 5-year panel data similar to the one used in our baseline specification and match the timing of poverty data with that of the other variables (growth and other controls), we use a \"closest\" criterion or take the average if two poverty observations are one year above and one below the assigned year. We should also note that the current PovcalNet series uses a poverty line of 1.90 2011 US$, which replaces its previous line of 1.25 2005 US$ (see Ferreira et al. 2016 , for more details). Poverty rises by construction with the poverty line and declines as the poverty measure changes from P0 to P2 (i.e., as one considers more bottom-sensitive measures). For our lognormal poverty estimates, the table shows that median headcount poverty P0 is 0.6% using US$ 1.25 per day as poverty line, but it raises to 2.3% with a US$ 2 poverty line, and to 13% with US$ 4. Likewise, the median P1 ranges from less than 0.1% for US$ 1.25 to about 4% for US$ 4, while the median P2 ranges from less than 0.1% for US$ 1.25 to almost 2% for US$ 4. Although the mean and the median of these poverty measures are relatively small, the heterogeneity in the sample is quite high, since the ranges of the various poverty measures run from a minimum of zero (reflecting the presence of high-income countries in the sample) to a maximum whose value depends on the particular poverty measure and poverty line under consideration. For example, depending on the poverty lines considered, these maximum levels go from 90 to 99% for P0, from 60 to 86% for P1 and from 50 to 75% for P2. The maximum corresponds in all cases to Tanzania. We use headcount poverty P0 (with a poverty line of US$ 2 per day) as our baseline poverty measure for the rest of the paper. Figure 1 shows the sample correlation between annual per capita growth, the baseline P0 (for US$ 2) and the Gini coefficient. The top graphs plot growth against lagged poverty, and the bottom graphs plot growth against the Gini coefficient. The leftmost graphs show the unconditional correlation, while the center graphs control for lagged income and the rightmost graphs add also regional dummies. The top left scatter, which shows the unconditional correlation between growth and poverty, highlights the degree of heterogeneity in the sample. For instance, there is a wide range of observations with very small poverty rates and very large variation in growth rates (from \u2212 5% to + 10%). At high poverty rates (above 80%, say), the range of variation in growth rates is fairly wide as well. However, once we control for real per capita GDP (top center graph), the correlation turns negative and significant. The result is robust to the addition of regional dummies. Results are different for the growth-inequality scatter plots. The ambiguous relation shown in the leftmost graph turns negative when we control for real per capita GDP. However, it becomes slightly positive (but insignificant) when adding regional dummies. Fig. 1 Growth, poverty and inequality: preliminary cross section evidence. Note Growth is measured as per capita annual GDP growth between 1970 and 2010. The initial period is 1970. For the graphs in the second column, growth, as well as initial poverty P0, and the initial Gini coefficients G0 are the residuals from projecting the respective original variables on initial per capita GDP (in logs). For the graphs in the third column, they are measured as the residuals from projecting the respective original variables on initial per capita GDP (in logs) and a set of regional dummies (North America, Europe and Central Asia, Latin American and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific) Additional controls used in the empirical exercises described in Sects. 4 and 5 (years of schooling, investment prices, inflation, trade openness, government size, degree of democracy, etc.) come from the Penn Word Tables, the World Development Indicators database, the Barro and Lee (2013) educational attainment database, and the political risk module of the International Country Risk Database (ICRD).",

As a measure of human capital, we consider the average years of secondary education for males and females in our baseline specification, and the rate of primary and secondary school attainment (as a percentage of the population) in our robustness analysis. The distinction between male and female education is motivated by the finding that the latter appears to be more important than the former in raising labor productivity in developing countries (Owen et al. 2002) . Human capital is expected to have a positive impact on growth. However, neither the years of education nor the educational attainment measures capture the quality of education (Hanushek 2017) , which detracts from the significance of their growth contribution (Sianesi and Van Reenen 2003) .

(1), which omits the Gini coefficient-it can still affect growth indirectly through poverty. The reason is that inequality and poverty are related. This is not due to our assumption of lognormality when constructing the poverty data, but just a general consequence of the very definition of poverty as the share of the population whose income lies below the poverty line. Given the poverty line and the overall population's mean income, an increase in inequality (more precisely, a mean-preserving spread of the income distribution) must bring more individuals below the poverty line, and therefore raise the poverty rate. 13 Hence, poverty and inequality are positively correlated in general, a fact that also applies to our dataset, as can be confirmed from the pairwise correlations reported in Table 14 . If poverty has a negative effect on growth (i.e., if \u03b4 0 in (1) is negative), it follows that an increase in inequality would raise poverty and reduce growth through this indirect channel. We return to this issue in Sect. 6. Furthermore, if inequality does have a direct effect on growth, the poverty coefficient estimate from a regression equation like (1) that erroneously omits inequality will be biased, and-other things equal-the bias will be greater the larger the correlation between poverty and inequality. To avoid such problem, we also estimate a model including both lagged inequality and lagged poverty as explanatory variables:",

In this setting, the estimated parameters capture the direct impacts of poverty and inequality on growth, as well as potential indirect effects due to other variables omitted from the model (Galor 2009 ). Our second model (M2) is taken from the empirical literature on inequality and growth (Perotti 1996; Forbes 2000) . It comprises a measure of market distortions (the domestic price of investment goods relative to that of the USA) and a measure of human capital, given by the average years of secondary education of the male and female populations, considered separately. Our third model (M3) focuses on standard policy indicators (Barro 2000) . It includes the rate of inflation of the GDP deflator (macroeconomic stability), the adjusted ratio of the country's volume of trade to its GDP (the degree of openness), and the ratio of public consumption to GDP (government size). Lastly, the fourth model (M4) is taken from L\u00f3pez and Serv\u00e9n (2015) . It includes the inflation rate, the average years of secondary female education, and a lagged composite index of public infrastructure. 14 See Table 7 for the baseline case of headcount poverty with a US$ 2 poverty line. For alternative poverty lines and measures, the R 2 ranges from 0.303 for P2 (US$-1.25) to 0.582 for P0 (US$-4). 15 The distinction between uncorrelatedness and independence is important here. Our measure of poverty is constructed as a (exact) nonlinear function of log-income and the Gini. This implies that the data do not contain shocks to poverty independent from (as opposed to uncorrelated with) inequality and average income-indeed, the sample variation in poverty is not due to shocks correlated with income and inequality is necessarily due to shocks correlated with various nonlinear functions of these variables. Although we can estimate a linear equation such as (3), the interpretation of the resulting coefficient estimates requires some caution. For this reason, the discussion below focuses primarily on the empirical estimates of (1) and (2), and we view the estimation of (3) as a robustness check.",

Its magnitude is larger in absolute value in the WG regressions than in the pooled-OLS regressions, but it is in all cases economically significant. Other things equal, a one-standard deviation decline in poverty (24.7 p.p., Table 1 ) is associated with an increase in income growth between 0.8% and 2.1% per annum. In contrast, results are not robust regarding the inequality-growth relationship.

For the strippeddown model M1, which omits all controls, results are more mixed, as the test fails to reject the null at the conventional 5% level in some exercises (those in Tables 4 and 5) but rejects it in others (those in Tables 15, 16) . The exception is model M2, for which the test consistently finds significant evidence of cross-sectional dependence. 19 Overall, we take these results as supporting the view that models M3 and M4 are correctly specified.

Weak identification arises when the instruments are only weakly correlated with the endogenous regressors, and its consequence is that estimators perform poorly (Nelson and Startz 1990) . To assess the strength of the instruments employed in our system GMM estimations-in particular, the identification of the poverty and inequality parameters-we use tools designed for settings featuring multiple endogenous regressors. We follow Sanderson and Windmeijer (2016) (SW hereafter), who propose a conditional F statistic based on Angrist and Pischke (2009) to test whether, in a multivariate setting, a particular endogenous regressor is weakly instrumented. For each such regressor, a conditional test is constructed by \"partialing-out\" linear projections of the remaining endogenous regressors. SW show that the conditional F statistic can be assessed against the Stock and Yogo critical values, and the weakness can then be expressed in terms of the size of the bias of the IV (or 2SLS) estimator relative to that of the OLS estimator. The null hypothesis is that the instruments are weak. It is rejected if the conditional F statistic exceeds the corresponding critical value, and we use a critical value allowing for a 30 percent maximal relative bias. We also perform a Chi-square under-identification test separately for each regressor. Here, the null hypothesis is that the matrix of coefficients from the first-stage conditional regressions is not full rank, signaling a complete failure of identification. Thus, rejection of the null supports identification, although not necessarily the absence of weak identification (Kleibergen and Paap 2006) . These tests have been originally designed for use with external instruments in IV or 2SLS settings; no suitable equivalents exist for system GMM at present. Thus, to apply the tests to our system GMM setting, we follow Bun and Windmeijer (2010) and construct the exact instrument matrix for the difference and level equations of each system GMM estimator, and then apply the standard 2SLS regressions and tests to each case. Table 6 reports the results of the SW tests for all models estimated under our baseline system GMM specification (Table 5 ). For lagged poverty and inequality, we present the Chi-square under-identification test, and the weak instruments F statistic.",

This approach considers a linear fixed-effects model such as our Eqs. (1)-(3) allowing for a nonparametric specification for one particular regressor. 21 Figure 2 depicts the nonlinear nonparametric estimates of the effects of lagged poverty and the lagged Gini index. To save space, we only show results for model M1, but results using models M2, M3 and M4 are qualitatively similar. They are consistent with our findings using the conventional specification: First, lagged poverty is negatively correlated with growth, and more strongly so for high poverty levels; second, the lagged Gini index is weakly correlated with growth, which echoes the lack of robustness found with the conventional specification. When the Gini index is nonparametrically adjusted, the estimated linear coefficient for poverty is still negative and significant at 5%.",

The poverty rates based on alternative poverty lines and poverty measures exhibit high, but not perfect, pairwise correlation (ranging from 0.74 to 0.99). As the different poverty measures capture different dimensions of poverty, the robustness analysis can be informative about potential differences in their respective effects on growth. Table 7 reports system GMM estimates of all specifications that this strategy yields, with the matrix of instruments defined as in Table 5 . Regarding the poverty coefficient, 72 out of 72 estimates are negative, and 71 out of 72 are also significant, regardless of the choice of poverty measure, poverty line, and set of control variables employed. In general, the absolute value of the poverty coefficient rises as we move from P0 to P2. In turn, while all 72 estimates of the inequality coefficient are negative (recall that the positive estimates arise from the within-country dimension of the data, Tables 3, 4), only 36 of them are significant at the 10 percent level or better.

However, one may wonder if that choice has a significant effect on our empirical results. To address this concern, we next re-compute our system GMM estimates using only the PovcalNet poverty data. However, as already noted, the small size (especially in the time dimension) of the raw PovcalNet sample would pose a major obstacle to our estimation approach. Thus, to expand the sample size, we use the interpolated poverty series provided in PovcalNet, as discussed in Sect. 3.1. The main difference between our lognormal poverty measures and those from PovcalNet is not the lognormal approximation, but the reference average income used. In PovcalNet, poverty is directly computed from the income distribution of the household surveys, hence the reference point is the mean level of household income obtained from the survey. In our lognormal approach, average income is given by the 2005 PPP-adjusted GDP per capita from the national accounts. We already discussed the advantages of using this approach in Sect. 3.1.",

We also experimented with a modified version of the basic empirical equation including a quadratic term in the Gini coefficient. The main conclusion is that the significantly negative effect of poverty on growth is quite robust to all these variations in specification and estimation approach, while the inequality-growth relationship is highly fragile. Finally, we also re-estimated the models in a pure cross section of countries, with the variables expressed as averages over the entire sample period, capturing what could be viewed as the long-run relationship between them. The estimated poverty coefficient remains uniformly negative and significant, although its precision declines somewhat relative to the panel estimates. In turn, inequality tends to show a negative and significant coefficient, more frequently than in the panel estimates, consistent with recent evidence (e.g., Halter et al 2014; Berg et al. 2018 ) that inequality exerts a negative long-run impact on growth.",

To take a deeper look, we estimate alternative versions of Eqs.

We follow the same strategy conditioning instead on the lagged level of inequality, and estimate Eqs. (1)-(3) allowing for different coefficients on poverty and inequality depending on whether the lagged Gini coefficient lies above or below its sample median (39.8%, see Table 1 ). Table 9 reports estimates distinguishing whether poverty is above or below the median-what we shall label the 'high poverty regime' and 'low poverty regime,' respectively. In turn, Table 10 reports the estimates distinguishing whether inequality is above or below the median-the 'high inequality regime' and 'low inequality regime,' respectively. In both cases, we use the baseline system GMM specification (Table 5) . Table 9 shows that, under the low poverty regime, the impact of poverty on growth is negative but statistically insignificant. However, it is negative and highly significant under the high poverty regime. In turn, the estimated coefficient on the Gini index is in most cases negative, but it turns significant only for high poverty rates and for the M1 and M3 model specifications. Thus, like with the unconditional estimates, while the result for poverty is robust, the result for inequality is not. In contrast, Table 10 shows that, when we condition on the lagged level of inequality, the estimated coefficients on Table 9 Estimation results by poverty regimes Baseline system GMM estimates: 1 lag in the instrument matrix, starting at t \u2212 3.

In effect, they are very similar to the unconditional estimates from Table 5 . As a final exercise, we allow the growth effects of poverty and inequality to vary across countries according to their level of development. Specifically, we divide the sample countries into two groups, developed and developing, with the distinction drawn according to the World Bank classification. The \"developed\" group comprises countries classified as upper-middle income, high-income non-OECD, and highincome OCDE; the \"developing\" group comprises those classified as low-income and lower-middle income. The estimation results, reported in Table 11 , are similar to those obtained in Table 9 when the two groups are drawn according to the median headcount poverty rate: The negative impact of poverty on growth is larger and more significant for developing countries than for developed ones; indeed, for the latter, the effect is insignificant in most cases.

Since when P0 is below the median the estimate of \u03b4 1 is statistically insignificant, the indirect effect of inequality on growth is negligible in this situation. Thus, we focus on the high poverty subsample. Figure 3 shows the estimated indirect effect of inequality on growth (expressed in percent per year) for models M1, M2, M3 and M4, and two alternative sets of estimates: the unconditional estimates, ignoring the prevailing poverty regime, and the estimates obtained when poverty is above the median. Specifically, the figure Table 4 , along with the poverty-inequality coefficient in Table 12 (the IV estimates). For the case of P0 > Median, we use \u03b4 1 from Table 9 . for P0 > Median, along with the corresponding poverty-inequality coefficient from illustrates the consequences of a one-standard deviation increase in the Gini coefficient (i.e., by 0.10 according to Table 1 ). In all cases, we use estimation results from Eq. (3). 24 To compute the unconditional indirect effect of inequality on growth, we combine the estimated \u2202 p/\u2202g from Table 12 for the IV case (equal to 0.307) with the unconditional estimates of \u03b4 1 in (3) from the baseline system GMM ( Table 5 ). The indirect effect of inequality (through poverty) on growth is always negative. Specifically, a 10point increase in the Gini coefficient generates, through the indirect effect, a decrease in annual growth by about 0.20 (model M4) to 0.40 (model M1) percentage points. For the high poverty case (P0 above the median), we employ the estimates of \u03b4 1 applicable to that regime from Table 9 , and the estimated \u2202 p/\u2202g of 0.725 from Table 12 for the IV approach. In this scenario, the indirect impact of inequality on growth is uniformly negative, and larger than the unconditional one, i.e., a 10-point increase in the Gini coefficient reduces growth on average by 0.6 percentage points (model M3) or 0.9 percentage points (model M1) per year.",

The empirical strategy involves including inequality and poverty indicators among the explanatory variables in an otherwise standard empirical growth equation. On the whole, the results reveal a consistently negative and strongly significant correlation of poverty with subsequent growth. Its magnitude is economically significant too: A 10 percentage point decrease in the headcount poverty rate is associated with a rise in annual per capita real growth of 0.5% to 1.2%. However, further analysis reveals that the significance of the effect depends on the prevailing level of poverty. Specifically, when the level of poverty is low (below the sample median), the growth effect of poverty is not statistically significant. In contrast, when the level of poverty is high, changes in the poverty headcount rate do show a significantly negative association with subsequent growth.",

Still, the indirect effect of inequality (through poverty) on growth is robustly negative, especially when the level of poverty is above the sample median. Its magnitude is also economically significant, e.g., a 10-percentage point decrease in the Gini coefficient is associated with an increase in per capita growth ranging between 0.2% and 0.4% in the full sample, and over twice as large in the above-median poverty subsample.",

Because poverty deters growth, a shock that causes poverty to rise may lead to a subsequent growth slowdown. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a relevant example. The growth collapse triggered by the pandemic is estimated to have raised extreme poverty in developing countries by some 120 million individuals in 2020 (or, equivalently, more than 20% over the pre-pandemic trend), with an even larger increase expected for 2021 (Lakner et al. 2021 ). However, these figures are biased downward because they assume no change in inequality, and the evidence shows that pandemics typically raise inequality (Furceri et al. 2020) . Rising inequality adds indirectly to the poverty surge. In fact, while reliable data are not yet available, some rough estimates (e.g., IMF 2020) suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is leading to a substantial increase in inequality in emerging and developing countries, especially poorer ones, which will result in a further increase in poverty rates and a major setback to the fight against global poverty. Our results imply that, in addition, the poverty rise may act as a drag on future growth, potentially triggering a vicious circle of stagnating incomes and rising poverty.",

Supporting the incomes of poor households in the face of adverse shocks-such as COVID-19-through expanded social assistance (e.g., cash transfers, food stamps and in-kind nutrition) and enhanced social protection (e.g., relaxing eligibility criteria for unemployment insurance, expanding sick pay), as well as improved access to education and health care, can help contain the impact on aggregate poverty and the knock-on effect on growth. More broadly, our results suggest that these kinds of policies may be indicated not only for reasons of social equity and fairness, but also from the point of view of overall growth and prosperity. Variables are transformed in the same way as for the regression analysis. For example, per capita GDP in logs; poverty and the Gini coefficient in levels; openness in logs and adjusted by population, kilometers, to be oil exporters and landlock; government size in logs, etc. We consider two alternative measures of the headcount poverty rate: first, using a lognormal approximation (Dollar and Kraay 2002; Sala-i-Martin 2006; L\u00f3pez and Serv\u00e9n 2015) , and, for a reduced sample, using the PovcalNet database See Tables 15, 16 .

In all cases, this different instruments structure is to keep the number of instruments below the number of cross sections to avoid overfitting problems. Notice the purpose of this table is not to compare results between models, but to check for robustness of our main results",

The literature employs also other functional forms, such as the Pareto, the gamma or the Weibull distribution, but the lognormal is the more widely used. Indeed, L\u00f3pez and Serv\u00e9n (2006) compare the quintile income shares generated by a lognormal distribution with their observed counterparts using data from over 1000 household surveys and find the lognormal approximation fits the data extremely well, so that they are unable to reject the null hypothesis that per capita income follows a lognormal distribution.Under lognormality, given the Gini coefficient (g), the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the log of income is given by \u03c3 \u22121 1+g 2 , where (\u00b7) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. Using this expression and the log of per capita income (y), we can compute the FGT family of poverty measures for a given poverty line z as: Appendix 3: Alternative system GMM estimation results",
