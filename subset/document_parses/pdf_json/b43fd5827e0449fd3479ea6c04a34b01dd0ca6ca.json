This has been reported in the previous literature where patients with acute cerebral vascular accidents and acute coronary syndrome experienced a decrease in hospital admissions or delayed presentation due to fear of contracting COVID-19 . 10 Although the observed reduction specialty-wide aligned with ED volume, transfers for individual specialty varied considerably in frequency from the 2019 comparison. Transfers to gastroenterology, neurosurgery, neurology, trauma, and urology, matched in volume to the total number of ED patients. Alongside this, transfer rates for vascular, ear nose and throat/oral and maxillofacial surgery, pediatrics, burn, and orthopedics remained low, indicating that irrespective of the emergent disease process the risk of contracting COVID-19 was deemed too high to seek medical care by the patient.",

Although attempts were made to minimize confounding variables by examining a similar time period from the previous year, the rate of ED transfers could have been impacted by specialist coverage and any changes in institutional policies during the time studied. Transfer rates may have also been affected by receiving-facility protocols during the early stages of the pandemic and patient willingness to be transferred to an outside facility.",
