Here, we conduct a head-to-head comparison of BNT162b2 versus ChAdOx1 against Covid-19. We analyse 235,181 UK Biobank participants aged 50 years or older and vaccinated with one or two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1. People are followed from the vaccination date until 18/10/2021. Inverse probability weighting is used to minimise confounding and the Cox models to derive hazard ratio. We find that, compared with one dose of ChAdOx1, vaccination with BNT162b2 is associated with a 28% (95% CI, 12-42) decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, two doses of BNT162b2 vs ChAdOx1 confers 30% (95% CI, 25-35) and 29% (95% CI, 10-45) lower risks of both infection and hospitalisation during the study period when the Delta variant is dominant. Furthermore, the comparative protection against the infection persists for at least six months among the fully vaccinated, suggesting no differential waning between the two vaccines. These findings can inform evidence-based Covid-19 vaccination campaigns and booster strategies.",

Although phase 3 trials suggested that all four have high clinical efficacy, mRNA vaccines demonstrated numerically greater efficacy than adenoviral-based ones: BNT162b2 reported 95% efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19 1 , mRNA-1273 94.1% efficacy 2 , whilst ChAdOx1 had 70.4% 3 , and Ad26.CoV2.S had 66.9% efficacy 4 .

Although useful, none of these studies conducted head-to-head comparisons of vaccine effectiveness. With the ongoing pandemic and rapid rollout of the Covid-19 vaccination programme all over the world, evidence on their comparative performance has become more crucial to inform policy decisions on optimizing vaccine implementation strategies, not only in countries where greater coverage of the prime dose is urgently required or in countries where boost doses and sequential immunization are being considered. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the comparative effectiveness of BNT162b2 vs ChAdOx1 vaccines against Covid-19 infection and hospitalization in a large and population-based prospective cohort of people aged 50 years or older.",

Liu et al. 13 found that the BNT162B2-BNT162B2 appeared more immunogenic than the ChAdOx1-ChAdOx1 schedule, with higher levels of antibodies at 28 days after the first and second dose. A similar finding was reported in the Borobia et al. study comparing the heterologous BNT162B2-ChAdOx1 and the homogenous ChAdOx1-ChAdOx1 vaccine regimens 14, 15 . In line with this evidence, our study showed a lower risk of Covid-19 outcomes in people vaccinated with BNT162b2 overall and across subgroups.",

Several fundamental factors might explain the disagreement with our results. First, Hulme's study only included health and social care workers who are more likely to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 than our cohort: a community-based \"healthy volunteer\" population 17 , which was corroborated by the higher infection rate in their study (58 per 1000 person-years) compared to ours (~13 per 1000 person-years) during the first few weeks following the first dose. Second, both ours and Hulme's studies found that, on average, rollout of BNT162B2 happened earlier than ChAdOx1. Given the variation in community transmission over time in England, insufficient control for vaccination date could result in biased estimates of their comparative effect. Informed by this, we observed a substantial change of hazard ratio after the complete alignment of the first vaccination date using the weighting approach when the background transmission varied substantially (Supplementary Figure 1 , Exposure anchor period). In contrast, adjusting/weighting the second vaccination date had little impact on the estimate, likely due to the relatively low and stable virus circulation at that period (Supplementary Figure 1 , Exposure anchor period). Third, Hulme's risk assessment period started from the first dose (January to February 2021) and ended on 13 June 2021, reflecting a mixed effect of one and two doses of vaccines.",

First, the granularity of UK Biobank data and comprehensive linkage to external data sources allowed us to measure and control for an extensive array of confounders, including demographics, socio-economic deprivation, comorbidity, and medication usage. Our negative control outcome analyses provided reassurance that no significant residual confounding remained after adjusting the mentioned covariates using IPW methods. Secondly, the proposed study outcomes (Covid-19 and related hospitalization) were identified through linkage to official national databases of tests and hospital inpatient data, minimising the risk of misclassification. Finally, the sample size of our cohort triplicated that of the largest phase III trials, enabling us to detect differences in hospital admission rates, which seemed underpowered in randomized trials. Our findings support evidence from pivotal trials suggesting that BNT162b2 provides additional protection against Covid-19 and hospitalisation than ChAdOx1 vaccination. For the first time, we demonstrated that this comparative effectiveness endured over six months when the Delta variant was predominant, and community transmission kept increasing in the UK. These findings highlight the importance of continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of different vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants to inform future booster campaigns and vaccine combinations strategies.",
