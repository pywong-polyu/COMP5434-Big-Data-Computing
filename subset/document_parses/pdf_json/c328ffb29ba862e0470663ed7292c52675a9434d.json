We investigate how the U.S. general public prioritizes the health and the income dimensions amid COVID-19 using an incentivized instrument with real monetary consequences. We also employ between-subject information treatments highlighting negative health and income consequences of the pandemic. Specifically, participants have to divide monetary contributions between two charitable organizations representing either the health or the income dimension. An overwhelming majority of participants supports both dimensions, with higher monetary contributions to the health dimension (56%) compared to income (44%), but the difference is not large. Only a small fraction of respondents contributes exclusively to the health (10%) or income (5%) dimensions. Increasing the salience of negative health outcomes of COVID-19 raises differential token allocations in favor of the health-oriented charity. This finding is important since the course of COVID-19 will be shaped by the policies governments implement and how the general public reacts to these policies.",

After the first case was detected in China, over a third of the world's population are under social distancing and stay-at-home lockdown measures in an attempt to attenuate the spread of the virus (see https://www.businessinsider.com/countries-on-lockdowncoronavirus-italy-2020-3). Although social isolation measures seem to be an effective instrument for reducing the spread of COVID-19 [2] [3] [4] , they also cause temporary disruption of non-essential businesses, which results in devastating economic losses [5] [6] [7] . This unique environment raises questions about a potential trade-off in public efforts in dealing with the twodimensional nature of the pandemic. Previous studies suggest that pandemics may induce zero-sum behavior when dealing with their consequences [8] . On the one hand, there is public support needed to combat the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical supplies in many places around the world (i.e., the health dimension). On the other hand, displaced workers without a source of income as a result of the stay-at-home directives need public support to endure the loss of employment or income during the pandemic (i.e., the income dimension). In reality, both dimensions constitute a form of a public good with a symbiotic relationship, which tend to mutually enhance each other. Not raising enough resources for the health dimension increases the vulnerability of medical professionals and the general public that can result in more infections and deaths. Not providing enough resources for displaced workers reduces their ability to comply with the stay-at-home directives, thereby increasing their social exposure and the spread rate of the virus. Therefore, the implied tradeoff can also be seen as a two-dimensional public good (see https://economicstrategygroup.org/ resource/economic-strategy-group-statement-covid19/). Not surprisingly, many countries including the United States, Japan, Germany and others have implemented massive fiscal stimulus packages to combat COVID-19 in these two dimensions. For instance, the U.S. fiscal stimulus bill encompasses $2 trillion to assist households and businesses affected by the COVID-19 (see https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3548/text). In fact, preliminary evidence shows that strict and timely public health measures can lead to a better economic recovery [7, [9] [10] [11] .",

            "text": "The implied trade-off between the health and income dimensions has caused heated political debates around the world. In the United States, there have been numerous public protests from citizens demanding the easing of lockdown directives and reopening the economy [12] . The tensions are further exacerbated by high profile policy discussions regarding the appropriate timeframe to reopen the economy. Analyses from epidemiologists and economists caution that a premature relaxation of lockdown measures can increase the likelihood of a second wave of the pandemic [4, 5] . Constant discussions in the U.S. public discourse about the \"trade-off\" between the health and income dimensions of COVID-19 resonate as a heavily socio-political polarizing issue [12] . Partisan views create a political connotation around this subject, which could potentially result in a dilution of public support for both causes. Supporters of each cause are also promoting their agenda by exposing the general public to information supporting the potential consequences of each dimension, which in return increases the polarization of the public discourse. An analysis of Google search trends across the United States between March 19th and April 6th of 2020 highlights this tension. In the indicated time period, internet searches for coronavirus had two top related queries in this particular order: \"thank you coronavirus helpers\" (which was about acknowledging unprecedented efforts of healthcare workers) and \"coronavirus stimulus bill\" (which was about Government's fiscal relief package to alleviate the economic consequences of COVID-19). However, it is not clear whether society at large sees these two dimensions as opposing forces having a zero-sum tradeoff relationship. The underline assumption behind the zero-sum tradeoff is that the Health and Income causes are in contradiction, and support to either of them diminishes the effectiveness of the other cause. The zero-sum-tradeoff attitude also implicitly assumes that efforts to alleviate Health or Income issues compete for the same limited resources. Supporting one cause deprives the \"competing\" cause of the available public funds. Hence the Health and Income dimensions of the public support are irreconcilable.",

We also shed light on whether the general public regards the alleged contradiction as a \"trade-off\" by eliciting second-order beliefs (i.e., an individual's beliefs about others' attitude).

The main objective of our paper is to investigate this alleged tradeoff between public support in the form of monetary contributions to healthcare supplies versus income needs. More specifically, we are interested in capturing the general public's views on prioritization of the health dimension and the income dimension inherent during the COVID-19 pandemic under the provision of different information conditions.

Participants have a diverse income range with $59,000 median effective household income. In the analysis, we divide the household income by the square root of household size and obtain the effective household income for the importance of this measure for making a society-wide inference [14] .

This enables us to capture other-regarding preferences without the contamination of self-interest. We decided against allowing participants to keep any funds in order to understand preferences for the allocation of public resources. Allowing participants to keep a part of the funds would be highly correlated with income and whether the participant has been economically affected by Covid-19. It may also confound measures of altruism and warm-glow. One of the charitable causes represents the health dimension (i.e., the Health-Charity). The Health-Charity works to reduce the health consequences of COVID-19 by equipping medical professionals with lifesaving medical resources. The Health-Charity delivers protective masks, exam gloves, and isolation gowns to health-care organizations in areas with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The other charitable cause represents the income dimension (i.e., the Income-Charity). The Income-Charity supports hourly workers who have lost their jobs due to COVID-19 and are not able to work and do not have another source of income (see [15] for the importance of using an incentivized donation to a charitable cause as an instrument for eliciting general public views about controversial issues). The allocation of funds is public, in the sense that participants fully allocate all of the tokens between these two causes using a third party's money.

A Health treatment (N = 145) provides additional information about the pandemic's devastating effects to public health while an Income treatment (N = 150) highlights the rise in unemployment and loss of income related to the coronavirus crisis. Finally, a Combined treatment (N = 146) includes information provision of the Health and Income treatments combined (The information given for each treatment is available in the S1 Appendix). Since the combined treatment also contains counter-balancing information regarding income issues, we expect health issues will be more salient in the Health treatment. Overall, the treatment assignments allow us to highlight the importance of health and/or income issues the society faces and, in that context, to make individual token donations salient as important support for eradicating the mentioned problems [16] .",

In order to ensure that participants provided their truthful beliefs, this question was incentivized with a monetary reward of $1.00 for each correct answer. Our objective with this task is to quantify how participants' beliefs about the aggregate behavior of all respondents (i.e., as a proxy for the behavior of society in general) affects their own contributions. There are two potential channels. Participants may conform and follow what they believe the majority would do or they may diverge to provide stronger support to the cause they believe is in greater need. Fig 2 depicts the results of the incentivized prediction task and its relationship to personal allocations. We identify three belief types based on the prediction of token allocations: 1) Income-majority (16%), for participants who believe that the median allocation will favor the Income cause; 2) Equal-split (20%), for participants who believe that the median allocation will be identical for the Income and Health causes; and 3) Health-majority (64%), for participants who believe that the median allocation will favor the Health cause. Fig 2 shows that there is a strong correlation between beliefs and individual actions. On average, participants allocate their tokens in conformity with their predictions about the contributions of others. S1(a) Fig  in S1 Appendix shows that, on average, participants expect higher token allocations to the Health cause relative to the Income cause across all the experimental conditions. So, on average, individual respondents tend to favor the Health cause more than the Income cause and, interestingly, they also believe that their actions are in conformity with societal preferences. S1 allocations to the Health cause among participants who also believe that others will allocate more tokens to the Health cause. This result suggests that individuals who believe that public opinion favors health issues during the pandemic become more proactive when treated with conforming or incompatible information. This overlaps with the results shown in Figs 1 and 3, and suggests that Pro-health types are very sensitive to the most salient issue even when the information provided does not necessarily enforce their own priorities. Overall, our findings do not necessarily imply a causality. It is possible that participants guessed in a way to justify their own allocations. It is also possible that our subjects' beliefs about others' actions drove their own token allocations.",

Social distancing has been considered a key element that can substantially mitigate the impact of COVID-19 [2, 3] . The first wave of COVID-19 has shown that compliance with stay-at-home social isolation requirements is a form of public good [3] . This is especially the case in regions without official enforcement of punishment measures, as is the case in most states in the United States and many other countries. Public outbursts and protests against lockdown directives and business closures are common during the pandemic and based on our survey measures, they are expected to intensify as the number of days in seclusion increases. Thus, our results provide information about the distribution of the support for stayat-home social isolation directives that can be informative about general public support for this kind of measures.

Although we cannot disentangle motivations (e.g., pure altruistic, paternalistic, etc.) behind token allocations, our findings provide suggestive evidence on how the public values the health versus the income dimensions provide invaluable policy insights, since pursued government actions and the public reactions to the implemented policies will determine the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If individual i exclusively supports the public cause H (i.e., \u03b8 i,H = 1; \u03b8 i,I = 0), then she will contribute the entire endowment to H (g i,H (\u03b8 i,H , \ufffd) = \u03c9 i and g i,I (\u03b8 i,I , \ufffd) = 0). Conversely, if i exclusively supports the public cause I (\u03b8 i,H = 0; \u03b8 i,I = 1), then she will contribute the entire endowment to I (g i,H (\u03b8 i,H , \ufffd) = 0 and g i,I (\u03b8 i,I , \ufffd) = \u03c9 i ). Higher support for the health cause H or the income cause I indicates \u03b8 i,H > \u03b8 i,I or \u03b8 i,H < \u03b8 i,I , respectively. Then, individuals' contributions will be higher for the cause with the higher support. Finally, having equal support for both causes, \u03b8 i,H = \u03b8 i,I = 0.5, results in equal contributions, g i;H \u00f0y i;H ; \ufffd\u00de \u00bc g i;I \u00f0y i;I ; \ufffd\u00de \u00bc 1 2 o i . If we keep all other factors unchanged ( \ufffd L i;\u00c0 y i;k ) via balanced random treatment assignments, and expose individual i to information > H (> I ) favoring public good H, then for the same individual contribution amount, the marginal utility of contributing to the public good H is greater (less) than the marginal utility of contributing to the public good I. When the information provision equally favors both public goods > H&I (or neutral > N ), then for the same individual contribution amount, the marginal utility of contributing to the public good H is equal to the marginal utility of contributing to the public good I. 4 Main results Fig 1a shows that the difference in the average number of token allocations between the Health charity and the Income charity across all the experimental conditions is statistically significant (p-values < 0.01). On average, participants from all treatments contributed 56 tokens to the health cause and 44 tokens to the income cause. Interestingly, Fig 1b shows that the provision of income information only or the combination of income and health information does not change the health gap contributions relative to the control condition with no information provision. Providing exclusively health information increases the gap from 9 tokens in the Control to 20 tokens in the Health treatment (p-value = 0.04).",
