Using a sample of 230,540 respondents to an online survey from 17 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, the study shows that the economic impacts are large and unequal: 45 percent of respondents report that a household member has lost their job and, among households owning small businesses, 59 percent of respondents report that a household member has closed their business. Among households with the lowest income prior to the pandemic, 71 percent report that a household member lost their job and 61 percent report that a household member has closed their business. Declines in food security and health are among the disproportionate impacts. The findings provide evidence that the current public health crisis will exacerbate economic inequality and provides some of the first estimates of the impact of the pandemic on the labor market and well-being in developing countries.",

            "text": "To slow the spread of COVID-19, governments have implemented regulations that require social distancing, the closing of non-essential businesses, travel restrictions and, in many cases, stay-at-home orders [8] . Human interactions that drive the economy, such as working together in enclosed areas and enjoying entertainment activities, have been discouraged, restricted, or banned altogether. Residents are complying with these measures, report that they strongly support them [9] [10] [11] , and actively seek information [12] . Although these measures are necessary for public health, recent evidence from developed countries suggests that they have negative economic impacts in the short-run [13] [14] [15] and can potentially deepen the pre- existing gaps between rich and poor [16] . These negative impacts could be exacerbated in developing countries because firms and the workforce may be more vulnerable due to high levels of informality and weaker governmental capacity to alleviate the pandemic. This study employs a large-scale online household survey to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in differential economic impacts for households across the income distribution in Latin America and the Caribbean. The data show large and unequal job losses and business closures, and the effects are strongest for the lowest income households. These negative consequences also translate into declines in food security and support for policies to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Research on economic inequality is particularly relevant in Latin America and the Caribbean. Although inequality and poverty declined over the most recent decade [17, 18] , prior to the pandemic, the region still had the highest income inequality in the world [19] , and a large share of citizens were vulnerable to falling back into poverty due to economic shocks [20] .",

This study complements this work by quantifying the short-term implications of the pandemic on job losses and business closures and shows that these impacts further aggravate inequality in the region. Furthermore, [22] describes how macroeconomic spillovers can amplify the adverse economic effects of the pandemic, which would suggest that the estimates obtained are a lower bound.

The slope coefficient suggests that a percentage point increase in the share of self-employed workers in a country increases the likelihood that a respondent lost their livelihood by 0.54 percent (p-value = 0.005) with an R-squared of 42 percent. Because informality rates are high in most developing countries, this result provides a novel explanation for why labor markets in developing countries are particularly hard hit during the crisis. ",

Thirty percent of households with January 2020 income less than the national minimum wage also report that a household member provided a gift or loan, compared to 57 percent of households with the highest incomes in January 2020 who report the same. Across all income categories, the receipt of a gift or transfer is concentrated in households that report losing a job or closing a business. This highlights the importance of informal social protection networks as a tool for coping with the negative impacts of the pandemic. Despite these substantial economic impacts, respondents strongly support measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus in these early stages. Overall, 77 percent of respondents agree with the statement that the top priority of the national government should be to stop the pandemic and 54 percent of respondents think that non-essential businesses should remain closed for an additional month. Although the support for these policies is broad, the support is likely to decrease as more households lose their livelihoods. Column 2 of Panel B from Table 1 shows that the probability of agreeing with the statement that the government's priority should be fighting the pandemic is 2 percentage points lower (p-value < 0.01) among households that experienced a job loss or business closure. Column 3 of Panel B shows that the loss of livelihoods during the pandemic is linked to a 4 percentage-point decline (p-value < 0.01) in the probability of agreeing with the idea of keeping non-essential business closed for an additional month. The support for policies that aim to slow the spread of the coronavirus is thus fragile. Further, Fig 4 shows that, as days go by, the decline in support for keeping businesses closed for an additional month declines faster among households that lose their livelihoods. One important implication is that, without further assistance to impacted households, compliance with mobility restriction policies is likely to decline. ",

First, the type of policies that aim to prevent the spread of the virus is likely to affect informal workers more than formal workers (Fig  2) . The survey captures data both from countries without enforced mobility-restriction policies or curfews, such as Uruguay, and also from countries with more-stringent, mandatory quarantines and closures of non-essential businesses, as is the case in Bolivia and Peru. Because most of the informal and self-employed workers tend to work in jobs that make them prone to contact with other people (such as those in the retail or services sectors, as opposed to office or industry jobs), the latter set of policies may lead to larger disruptions in labor markets. Indeed, the data indicates that the share of respondents reporting job losses in their households during April (69 percent) is substantially higher in countries with national or local mandatory quarantines, relative to those in countries that did not implement mobility-restriction measures (34 percent) or only curfews (54 percent). See the Supplementary Information sections for a list of countries by type of policy. This finding of smaller economic costs in countries that did not implement national mobility restrictions at the onset of the pandemic than countries with more stringent policies is consistent with evidence from modelling various quarantine regimes gershon2020managing.",

Although further research is needed, several studies have found that current inequality is negatively correlated with future economic growth [24, 25] , and in particular, inequality driven by the lower tail of the income distribution stunts economic growth [26] . This implies that the unequal economic impacts of this short-term public health pandemic could have long-term implications for economic growth.
