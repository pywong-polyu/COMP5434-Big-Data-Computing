            "text": "Across three studies, we utilized an item-method directed forgetting (DF) procedure with faces of different races to investigate the magnitude of intentional forgetting of own-race versus other-race faces. All three experiments shared the same procedure but differed in the number of faces presented. Participants were presented with own-race and other-race faces, each followed by a remember or forget memory instruction, and subsequently received a recognition test for all studied faces. We obtained a robust cross-race effect (CRE) but did not find a DF effect in Experiment 1. Experiments 2 and 3 used shorter study and test lists and obtained a significant DF effect along with significant CRE, but no interaction between face type and memory instruction. The results suggest that own-race and other-race faces are equally susceptible to DF. The results are discussed in terms of the theoretical explanations for CRE and their implications for DF.",

            "text": "In our daily life, the ability to intentionally forget outdated, incorrect, or distressing information serves a critical role. Often, we need to engage in processes and behaviors that limit access to unwanted memories, known as intentional forgetting (e.g., Bjork et al., 1968) . Sometimes the need to forget is implicit and self-inflicted and sometimes more explicitly instructed by others. For example, in the courtroom, jurors are often asked to disregard certain information (Caretta & Moreland, 1983) , and studies have shown that jurors can disregard information if they believe it is irrelevant or untrustworthy (Kassin & Sommers, 1997; Mallard & Perkins, 2005) . Successful intentional forgetting has real-world implications. For example, Scully and Hupbach (2020) reported that participants could intentionally forget negative behavior of specific individuals, resulting in more positive judgments of those individuals. Sell (2016) demonstrated that participants who were instructed to forget the stories involving transgressions were more likely to later forgive the antagonist, indicating successful intentional forgetting can promote forgiveness. Furthermore, Xie et al. (2021) reported that participants who intentionally forget negative social feedback exhibited more positive emotional evaluations towards the providers of that feedback. Overall, intentional forgetting of an individual could later impact how that individual is evaluated and treated.",

            "text": "The current investigation involved intentional forgetting of identity of faces that differ in race. The critical question was whether intentional forgetting might reduce the crossrace effect (CRE) -a phenomenon referring to superior recognition of own-race than other-race faces (for reviews, see Meissner & Brigham, 2001; Young et al., 2012) . Imagine you happen to be in the middle of a street fight that breaks out between members of two racial groups, your own race and a different race, that results in an own-race member injuring an other-race member. If you were questioned by police about the event, correct identification of the aggressor might vary depending on your race and the race of the aggressor, and the assumptions you made while you were witnessing the fight. For example, if you assumed that the aggressor was from your own race, it may be more advantageous to intentionally forget the members of the other-race group. Doing so may more efficiently allocate your cognitive resources by focusing on the own-race group to subsequently facilitate an accurate identification of the aggressor from innocent by-standers. Alternatively, if later investigation revealed that the aggressor was actually from the other-race group that you had originally intentionally downregulated, it raises the question of whether your ability to differentiate the true aggressor from the innocent bystanders would be affected by previous downregulation. The CRE literature indicates that people have difficulty differentiating other-race faces, and 36% of wrongful convictions result from crossrace misidentifications (Dwyer et al., 2003) . Therefore, the impact of intentional forgetting on own-race and other-race individuals should be thoroughly investigated, as it could have important real-world implications.",

The directed forgetting (DF) procedure is one of the widely used techniques to study intentional forgetting (Bjork et al., 1968) . In the DF procedure, items are followed by instructions to either remember (R) or forget (F) those items, and these memory instructions are presented either after an entire list has been studied (listmethod) or following each item on a trial-by-trial basis (item-method). Both procedures result in impaired memory for F items compared to R items, a finding known as the directed-forgetting effect (for reviews, see MacLeod, 1998; Sahakyan, 2022; Sahakyan et al., 2013) . In the current studies, we utilized the item-method procedure to explore intentional forgetting of own-race and other-race individuals.",

The focus of the current study is on the racial identity of the faces, and its potential interaction with DF. Fitzgerald et al. (2013) manipulated racial attributes of studied faces and found the magnitude of the DF effect to differ between Asian and Black faces. However, since only the other-race faces were presented and tested (i.e., no Caucasian faces were presented in the study, whereas the participants were Caucasian), direct comparison between DF of own-and other-race faces could not be assessed. Therefore, even though this study found that faces of some races were more susceptible to DF than others, the study does not address whether DF is greater or smaller for own-race than otherrace faces. Our studies aimed to address the gap in the literature by directly examining DF for own-race and other-race faces.",

            "text": "Predictions regarding how own-race and other-race faces might be differentially susceptible to DF could be derived from theoretical views of the CRE. Contemporary views of the CRE encompass two broad classes: social-cognitive views and perceptual expertise views. According to the social-cognitive views of the CRE, people process other-race faces as \"out-group\" members and subsequently cognitively \"disregard\" them (e.g., Rodin, 1987; Sporer, 2001) . People may disregard other-race faces by allocating less processing resources to them after deeming them socially irrelevant or by processing commonalities for other-race faces at the expense of individuating information that focuses on the diagnostic differences between other-race faces (Levin, 2000; Maclin & Malpass, 2003; Meissner et al., 2005) . As a result, they may form less well-encoded, weaker representations of other-race faces. Previous DF studies have examined the relationship between the strength of encoding and DF. Studies employing depth of processing manipulations indicate that more elaborate processing reduces the DF effect (Dulaney et al., 2004; Geiselman & Bagheri, 1985; Lee, 2013) . Furthermore, DF is also diminished with materials that produce stronger encoding (Earles & Kersten, 2002; Hauswald & Kissler, 2008; Quinlan et al., 2010; Sahakyan & Foster, 2009 ). Finally, studies have also shown that DF is larger when the learned information is incongruent with the learner's perspective compared to congruent (Waldum & Sahakyan, 2012) . Given that stronger encoding as well as congruent perspective can reduce the DF effect, own-race faces may be less susceptible to DF compared to other-race faces. In other words, a greater DF may be observed for other-race than own-race faces.",

Perceptual views suggest that people engage in a holistic processing of ownrace faces that enables efficient construction of a face into a \"unified\" object, compared to a more piecemeal processing of other-race faces that focuses on individual facial features in isolation of one another (Michel et al., 2006; Rhodes et al., 1989; Tanaka et al., 2004) . Therefore, it is possible to make an argument that a Forget cue may be easier to implement on a more unitized representation because it provides a clearer \"target\" for downregulation relative to a more disjointed representation.

Doing so eliminated the CRE by improving later recognition performance towards Black faces more than towards White faces, whereas instructing participants to attend to the upper portion of the faces left the CRE intact. Also, Shriver and Hugenberg (2010) found that when other-race faces were labeled with occupations as high in power and socioeconomic status, the CRE was attenuated with the results showing equal recognition performance for own-race and other-race faces. Overall, the CRE can be modulated under some circumstances.

            "text": "Our findings suggest race might play a fundamentally different role in intentional forgetting of individuals in comparison with other facial features. As described previously, studies indicated that certain facial characteristics that are related to facial memorability render faces to be differentially susceptible to DF. For instance, a handful of studies have found that emotional expressions impact the Fig. 4 Directed forgetting effect for own-race and other-race faces combined across three experiments. The error bars reflect 95% confidence intervals memorability of faces, where unfamiliar happy faces are better remembered than angry or neutral faces (e.g., Foa et al., 2000; Kottoor, 1989) . In a DF investigation with unfamiliar faces of happy and angry expressions, Tay and Yang (2017) found that happy faces are less resistant to DF than are angry faces. It appears that faces of different memorability resulting from the facial expression interact with DF manipulation. Our findings, on the other hand, indicate that even though own-race faces are more memorable than other-race faces, they do not appear to be differentially susceptible to DF. These different outcomes between the current findings and previous ones may arise from the types of characteristics (i.e., race and expression) in facial recognition. According to Bruce and Young (1986) , face processing consists of two distinct routes, one involving recognition of unchangeable (invariant) features such as facial identity and one responsible for processing changeable (dynamic) features such as facial expression. These two pathways were found to involve functionally and neurologically unique systems (for review, see Calder & Young, 2005) . Critically, our results suggest that faces varying in unchangeable features including race (or racial identity) may not be differentially susceptible to DF but faces differing in dynamic characteristics including facial expression do, as demonstrated by previous studies. Future studies can extend the current findings and systematically investigate if and how DF may differentially impact these two types of facial information.",

Whereas with longer lists in Experiment 1 we did not observe DF, we detected DF in subsequent medium list length and short list length experiments, with an increasing effect size of DF. These observations are consistent with previous studies in the literature. For example, Reber et al. (2002) used 150 faces at encoding and 300 faces at test and failed to observe DF for faces. In contrast, other studies used fewer facial stimuli, presenting participants with 20, 60, and 48 faces during study, respectively, and obtained DF (e.g., Metzger, 2011; Quinlan & Taylor, 2014; Tay & Yang, 2017) . We suspect that a large number of faces presented during study may hinder the emergence of DF for faces because participants may stop complying with Forget/ Remember instructions due to the increased difficulty of the task. The role of list length in DF needs to be more systematically evaluated in future research given the Experiment \u00d7 DF interaction did not emerge as being significant in our combined analysis. Unlike the potential impact on DF, list length did not appear to alter the magnitude of the CRE as reflected in approximately similar effect sizes of the CRE, which remained a large size effect across the experiments with different list lengths. Thus, CRE is a robust phenomenon, which unfortunately does not appear to be mitigated by DF instructions.",

However, there was no significant main effect of Instruction, F(1, 48) = .45, MSE = .11, p = .504 , indicating that there was no significant DF effect in Experiment 1, d z = 0.10 (Remember: M = 1.43, SD = .41; Forget: M = 1.40, SD = .46). There was also no interaction of Instruction with Face Type, F < 1. These results were replicated in the AUC analyses. Namely, there was a significant main effect of Face Type, F(1, 48) = 30.41, MSE = .005, p < .001, indicating that overall own-race faces were remembered better (M = 0.82, SD = 0.09) than other-race faces (M = 0.77, SD = 0.09), confirming a significant CRE effect, d z = 0.79. However, we did not observe a significant main effect of Instruction, F(1, 48) = .073, MSE = .003, p = .79, suggesting no differences between recognition of Remember (M = 0.80, SD = 0.10) and Forget (M Recognition accuracy (d') across Instruction, Face Type, and Experiment.

Also, we did not observe any significant interactions between the Race of participants and DF or the Race of Participants and CRE in any of the three experiments. interaction, F(1, 48) = .82, MSE = .003, p = .37.Experiment 2: Medium listsThe analyses of d' revealed that there was a significant main effect of FaceType, F(1, 64)= 34.07, MSE = .55, p < .001, confirming the superior recognition for own-race faces (M = 2.00, SD = .67) over other-race faces (M = 1.47, SD = .60), indicating a CRE, d z = .73. In addition, a significant main effect of Instruction was observed, F(1, 64) = 7.09, MSE = .17, p = .01, with better recognition of Remember (M = 1.80, SD = .59) compared to Forget faces (M = 1.67, SD = .52), indicating a DF effect, d z = 0.33. However, no significant interaction of Instruction with Face Type emerged, F(1, 64) = .21, MSE = .14, p = .65. All of these findings were replicated in the AUC analyses.
