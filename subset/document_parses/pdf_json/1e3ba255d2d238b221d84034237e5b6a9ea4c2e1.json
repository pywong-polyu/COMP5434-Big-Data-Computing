This is in line with comments made by the Leask study mentioned earlier. 3 Dental professionals and organisations, especially the British Dental Association, were very actively involved in discussions with journalists and oral health advice was discussed frequently, as well as the difficulties the profession was facing. It was encouraging to see such a productive relationship with the media during a time where it was in the best interests of patients and dentists to provide accurate and helpful information.",

There were concerns with being able to afford to remain open due to a reduced patient case load; however, there were no stories of actual practices being forced to close within this study selection. As expected, PPE was a hot topic due to rising costs and a lack of availability. Early stories discussed the difficulties in acquiring the quantity required to be able to see the volume of patients needing treatment. Further on, towards the end of the year, the stories around PPE seemed to decline as supplies had increased and costs started to decrease. The cycle of themes followed the early stages of lockdown, with dental practices opening again, as well as when the tiered system was introduced (Fig. 1 ) and this is also reflected in the number of articles published (Fig. 2) .

Increasing the number of newspapers analysed could have improved thematic saturation and reduced the risk of selection bias, but this is not guaranteed.

Keep them simple and in lay terms to help get important messages across and consider signposting a journalist to clinical experts or professional bodies who may be able to help with their article, such as the British Dental Association, British Dental Health Foundation, a key opinion leader or a specialist in that field. 22 Specialist societies have press releases about certain topics and are a good source of information for journalists.",
