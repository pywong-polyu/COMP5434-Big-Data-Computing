In addition, if needed, a physician should be available, or referring to a specialized center might be possible.In the first and third days and preferably the last day ofthe remdesivir infusion, laboratory tests, including CBC, CRP, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and liver function tests, should be performed. Furthermore, if possible, inflammatory factors, such as lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and coagulation factors, should be checked on the first day. General condition and SpO2 should be checked, and a daily visit by a physician is necessary. Moreover, if the patient's condition worsens during this period or blood SpO2 drops to the threshold of hospitalization, the patient should be transferred to the hospital ward. Remdesivir therapy might need to be discontinued if the alanine transaminase (ALT) level increases",
