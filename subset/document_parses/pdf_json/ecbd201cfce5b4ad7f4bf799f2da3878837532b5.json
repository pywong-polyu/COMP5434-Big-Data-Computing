            "text": "Human cathelicidin refers to the cationic antimicrobial peptide hCAP18/LL-37. LL-37 is formed by cleavage of the propeptide hCAP18 coded with CAMP gene. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D), has been shown to induce the CAMP gene expression through promoter activation. We previously failed to demonstrate in a clinical trial that supplementation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) improves LL-37 serum levels. The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of 25(OH)D supplementation on intracellular expression of CAMP and secretion of LL-37 in an ex vivo model using the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). PBMC collected from healthy donors and incubated with different concentrations of 25(OH)D (0 ng/ml: control (D0); 25 ng/ml: deficient (D25); 75 ng/ml: physiological (D75); 125 ng/ml: supraphysiological (D125)) were stimulated or not with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/ml) or synthetic double-stranded RNA Poly (I: C) (PIC, 10 \u00b5g/ml). The intracellular expressions of the CAMP gene and the hCAP18 peptide were measured respectively after 24-h and 48-h incubation periods. The concentration of LL-37 was determined in the culture medium after 48-h incubation. 25(OH)D significantly induced CAMP gene expression at 24 h with a maximum effect at a dose of D125 in either unstimulated (tenfold expression) or stimulated (LPS: 100-fold expression; PIC: 15-fold expression) conditions. Intracellular hCAP18 peptide was overexpressed at 48 h under unstimulated (1.5-fold, D125) and stimulated conditions, LPS (twofold, D125) and PIC (2.5-fold, D125). The secretion of LL-37 in the culture medium was significantly induced by 25(OH) D only in both stimulated (LPS and PIC) conditions in a dose-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that 25(OH)D incubation increases intracellular expression of CAMP and hCAP18, but extracellular secretion of LL-37 antimicrobial peptide is increased by 25(OH)D only when PBMC from healthy donors were stimulated with bacterial or viral immune mimetic.",

            "text": "Cathelicidin is a generic name that can refer not only to the CAMP gene (cationic antimicrobial peptide), hCAP18 peptide (human cationic antimicrobial peptide 18 kDa), but also to LL-37 peptide (37 amino acid residues with diLeucine at the N-terminus, 4.5 kDa). hCAP18 peptide is coded by CAMP gene whose expression is regulated by vitamin D. More precisely, the active form of vitamin D 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D) binds to the vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR) [1] , enabling dimerization with retinol X receptor (RXR). This complex enters the nucleus to bind to a consensus vitamin D response element (VDRE) in the CAMP gene promoter, thus enhancing hCAP18 expression [2] . hCAP18 is widely expressed especially in the monocyte/ macrophage lineage in which it is stored in lysosomes or vacuoles [3] . Cleavage of the C-terminal end of hCAP18 by serine proteinase 3 in immune cells generates the active form of the cathelicidin, LL-37, and an inactive peptide, cathelin [4] . The two peptides, active form LL-37 and hCAP18, could be released, but LL-37 is considered as the major form present in the bloodstream. LL-37 plays a prominent role in innate host defense against bacteria and certain viruses, fungi, and parasites. The LL-37 microbicidal effect is principally due to its cationic properties allowing permeabilization of microorganism's membrane [2] . Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1, 2, and 4, induced by pathogen immune stimulators, were also reported to upregulate the expression of VDR and vitamin D hydroxylase genes, leading to the induction of cathelicidin production and eradication of intracellular Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis [1] .",

Recent studies in vitamin D-supplemented volunteers failed to enhance cathelicidin plasmatic level [13, 14] ; our team observed the same absence of effect in a placebo-controlled clinical trial with vitamin D supplementation in elderly volunteers [15] . Despite a strong improvement in serum 25(OH)D concentrations, we found no variation in LL-37 serum concentrations.",

Therefore, we established an ex vivo culture of freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors. The cells were incubated with several doses of 25(OH)D to assess intracellular CAMP gene expression, hCAP18 peptide expression, and LL-37-secreted concentrations in the culture medium. In addition to 25(OH) D, certain PBMCs were stimulated with bacterial or viral mimetics, respectively. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is known to induce CAMP overexpression via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induction [16] , as well as polyinosinic cytidylic acid (PIC), a well-known activator of TLR3 [17] .

Others have shown that exposure of keratinocytes to PIC increased the rate of 1,25(OH)D production and the expression of CYP27B1 [28] . These results suggest that TLR agonists activate vitamin D metabolism and signaling in situ. In keratinocytes, the in situ production of vitamin D which is known to have anti-inflammatory properties would permit to control the inflammatory process due to TLR inducers such as PIC, TNF, or LPS and to stimulate cathelicidin production [29] .",

(2018) reported evidence that LPS downregulates VDR expression in oral mucosal epithelia dependent on TNF\u03b1-miR346 signaling, and further suggested that vitamin D/VDR can suppress LPS-induced keratinocyte apoptosis by regulating NF-\u03baB pathway [30] . Conversely, 1,25(OH)D is known to upregulate TLR10 and to downregulate TLR 2, 4, and 5 in human monocyte THP-1 suggesting possible crosstalk between VDR and TLR signaling [31] . This crosstalk between VDR and TLR signaling pathways could explain why release of LL-37 is dependent on vitamin D concentration only when PBMC are stimulated by LPS or PIC. Actually, the TLR4-inducer LPS is known to be a key regulator of the expression and the activity of serine proteinase 3 that cleaves hCAP18 into LL-37 and cathelin [32] . Induction of TLR pathways would potentialize VDR signaling so that we observed a higher concentration of LL-37 with high doses of 25(OH)D only in stimulated conditions which allowed to strongly activate serine proteinase 3.",

Pioneer studies reported that hCAP18 is excreted and then processed to LL-37 extracellularly in a reaction catalyzed by serine proteinase 3 [4] . More recent works advanced that neutrophils and monocytes express serine proteinase 3 so that the processing could occur in vacuoles before exocytosis [33] . Nevertheless, this control of processing and externalization could occur in vivo both inside the cells (to release adequate amounts of the antimicrobial peptide in case of infection by bacteria, virus, and fungi) and/or outside the cells (if LL-37 concentration is too high in the bloodstream). This regulation is crucial because the LL-37 killing mechanisms are not specific so that in excess it can become a cytotoxic agent towards commensal bacteria and/ or host cells [34] .",

Moreover, we cannot affirm undoubtedly that LL-37 is the only peptide present in the culture media since the LL-37 ELISA kit used does not discriminate between the LL-37 and hCAP18 forms. It would be of great interest to develop a well-calibrated reference method to discriminate LL-37 and hCAP18 quantification in biological samples. For the moment, this is only possible by using SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as previously used to detect LL-37 in pellets of 1,25(OH)D-stimulated primary human monocytes [1] .",

However, extracellular production of LL-37 appears dependent on 25(OH)D only when PBMC are stimulated by bacterial or viral pathogen mimetics which is the major finding of our work. These data suggest that release of LL-37 in extracellular compartment is finely regulated to avoid non-specific killing of host microbiota since bactericidal properties of this cationic peptide are not strictly specific. Further studies should be encouraged to clarify the process of cleavage and externalization/degranulation of LL-37 given that this antibacterial and antiviral peptide could be a key factor in the reduced risk of influenza and COVID-19 infections associated to vitamin D supplementation as recently suggested [35, 36] .",
