This study examines numerous demographics of PE hospitalizations, offering a comprehensive and thorough overview of PE hospitalizations. We obtained the population used for this study from the NIS, an extensive, multiethnic hospital-based registry. However, as with any study, there are limitations that should be noted. Data from the NIS is subject to biases associated with retrospective studies. Additionally, the NIS reports information on hospitalizations and not from individual patients; therefore, patients admitted numerous times would be included more than once in the data set. The database also uses ICD-10 codes to report information, leaving it subject to coding errors. Finally, the NIS does not include information about the severity of the diagnosis at the time of admission. For example, it does not include the precise calcium level of patients with hypocalcemia.",

Our study showed that patients with PE and hypocalcemia had higher in-hospital mortality compared to those without hypocalcemia. These patients also had more comorbid conditions, as reflected by the Charlson comorbidity index. Patients hospitalized with a PE and concurrent hypocalcemia may be at higher risk of numerous inhospital complications, including sepsis, arrhythmias, acute kidney injury, and death. The findings of our study may reflect the effectiveness of using calcium as a prognostic marker in patients hospitalized with a pulmonary embolism.",
