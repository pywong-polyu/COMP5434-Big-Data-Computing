In this sense, university education has undergone significant changes owing to the impossibility of following the fully face-to-face mode of teaching. Given this situation, the general objective of this study is to analyze the university educational scenario in the context of COVID-19 and, more specifically, to identify the difficulties perceived by students. Using a mixed quantitative-qualitative methodological approach, an ad hoc questionnaire was designed, and data were collected from a sample of 238 students of the Bachelor's Degree in Teaching during the 2020/2021 academic year. The results obtained have shown that students have experienced numerous difficulties in adapting to the hybrid teaching model. In this sense, it is worth highlighting the decrease in motivation, the feeling of loneliness, technical connection problems, and less interaction with the teaching staff and other students. The degree of satisfaction with the teaching received is also moderate. As a conclusion, it can be stated that the difficulties identified recommend the introduction of actions to improve the application of the teaching model implemented in favor of university excellence.",

Nevertheless, virtual education in the university environment can be considered acceptable because of pandemic to continue with the study, despite detecting numerous obstacles. Some authors were struck by the loneliness experienced by students in online education, reflecting that they miss the help they receive from their peers in classrooms and laboratories and access to the library [23] . Likewise, the authors of [24] investigated the technological resources of the student body to cope with the change in education, and it was found that the emergence of COVID-19 has made the existing digital divide between urban and rural areas more visible. Also, the authors of [25] compare university students' learning and their experiences with the teaching-learning environment in general and during online study because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, it was found that students have had difficulty managing their time and more fragmented knowledge has been generated. It is added that students who tend to relate ideas, but with less ability to manage time and effort, have manifested a certain exhaustion with online teaching.",

Furthermore, research has been conducted on the use of technological tools by university students, and it has been found that it has led to the development of digital skills to improve their professional training, finding in technological tools an exceptional resource for their personal growth [26] . Online teaching-learning activities during the pandemic period have also been analyzed, leaving evidence that, even though, in the university, there was already a significant infrastructure in place to migrate from face-to-face to online teaching, there was no preparation for the change [27] . Other studies [28, 29] have reflected virtues in the online teaching model, by making possible the creation of real situations that could be solved by the student as if they were in the face-to-face classes. Nevertheless, the authors of [30, 31] have addressed the weaknesses of the adopted teaching modality, concluding that the learning environments created have had a negative impact on the students' scheduling and management of the study and on interactions with teachers and other students. For their part, the authors of [32] delve comparatively deeper into the teaching strategies applied and student satisfaction in two countries, detecting that the teacher-student relationship is negatively affected by the impossibility of maintaining direct and close contact in the classroom.",

Twelve experts participated in this process, among whom there were eight lecturers and four full professors, who had coordinated innovation projects in higher education at the university and outside the university. For the quantitative assessment of the items, the Aiken V coefficient [48] , which has the formula V = (X \u2212 1)/k, was chosen. This coefficient is one of the most widely used techniques to quantify the content validity or relevance of the item with respect to a content domain in N judges, whose magnitude ranges from 0.00 to 1.00; the value 1.00 is the highest possible magnitude, indicating perfect agreement among the judges with respect to the highest content validity score [49] .",

            "text": "Another difficulty experienced by students is the decrease in interaction during online learning. Along these lines, the authors of [59, 60] point out that interaction between the student and the teacher is a fundamental factor in breaking the feeling of isolation by generating a sense of belonging, as well as improving academic performance. In keeping with the promotion of autonomy that has been found in this mode of teaching, several studies [61, 62] have considered online teaching to be particularly favorable for learning at university, as it facilitates different and flexible learning scenarios. To fulfil this purpose, it is necessary to change the role of the lecturer from a mere transmitter of knowledge to a guide, tutor-mentor [61] , with the student becoming the main one responsible for his or her learning [63, 64] . It has been found that this change has not yet fully taken place. Thus, the study has shown that there are several aspects that need to be improved, such as poor advice and guidance from the teacher, poor time management on the part of the student, and the tendency to develop a more passive learning style. Along these lines, it was found that the teaching materials were not adapted, as also revealed by [65] , who found that students perceived that the teachers did not use resources geared towards virtual teaching, but rather that previous tools were reproduced.",

Thus, only 9.8% of students consider that the distance learning mode will have a fairly or totally positive impact on their performance. Analogous results were obtained by [65] , who detected percentages of students above 55% who state that learning in this modality is lower and that online classes cannot replace face-to-face classes. They also [27] displayed students' perception of the decline in the quality of teaching and its negative influence on their performance. On the other part, it is worth noting that students are not very satisfied with the teaching received, with the highest percentage of students being moderately or not very satisfied. Following this line, the authors of [19] found that 53.3% of the students were not very satisfied with the virtual teaching received and the situation experienced is considered to have a negative influence on future employment. The result obtained should be considered, because, as stated by [66] , student satisfaction is a valuable indicator in the evaluation of an educational center and contributes to the better management of universities, as it is an increasingly relevant factor in teaching processes, skills, and attitudes.",

In this way, the intention is that teachers do not limit themselves to reproducing the face-to-face pedagogical model in hybrid teaching and carry out didactic innovations in line with the new educational scenario. \u2212 Universities. Coordination to avoid the overlapping of face-to-face and online classes, application of adequate attention and advice for students, and economic provision to guarantee the necessary material resources and optimize the pedagogical model implemented. \u2212 Methodology. Implementation of strategies for more active, motivating, and autonomous learning with the continuous guidance of the teacher.
