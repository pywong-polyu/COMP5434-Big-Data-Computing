The burden of lower respiratory infections is unevenly distributed across the world and is primarily born in the developing countries with socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, where proper nutrition, clean fuel, sanitation, and clean air are unavailable or inadequate (2, 3) . China has experienced a staggering economic growth in the past 30 years, resulting in a steady increase in the life expectancy and improvement in the health outcomes in the country. From 1990 to 2019, the number of cases and mortalities of lower respiratory infections declined by 21.98 and 65.94%, respectively. In 2019, there were still 55.84 million cases, with 185,264.33 mortalities attributed to lower respiratory infections in China, making it the country's leading cause of mortality in children under-five (4) .",

However, these effect size estimates ignore the underlying statistical distributions of the air pollutants and may not be comparable across the size-specific particulate matter. In this study, we introduced the counterfactual analyses to effectively compare the potential reduction of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) hospitalizations (counterfactual outcomes) associated with the size-specific particulate matter (14) . These counterfactual outcomes, which accounted for the statistical distributions of air pollutants, can be directly comparable for different particulate matter and, therefore, have more public health implications for policymakers.",

This difference between the observed and counterfactual ALRI outpatient visits represents the estimated burden of ALRI outpatient visits associated with the size-specific particulate matter. The counterfactual scenarios were set to be hypothetical values of PM 2.5 and PM 10 set by the recently updated WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines (24 h mean: 15 \u00b5g/m 3 for PM 2.5 and 45 \u00b5g/m 3 for PM 10 ) (28). However, PM c was not directly regulated by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines, the reference concentration for PM c (30 \u00b5g/m 3 ) was defined as the difference between the standard concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2.5 according to the previous studies (17, 20) . The observed air pollution levels lower than the reference values were kept the same in the counterfactual scenario.

A total of 105,639 pediatric outpatient visits were included in the study, with the following breakdown of cases: 35,310 pneumonia, 68,218 bronchiolitis, and 2,111 asthma. Table 1 shows the summary statistics of ALRI subtypes, size-specific particulate matter (PM 10 , PM c , and PM 2.5 ), and gaseous pollutants (SO 2 , NO 2 , and O 3 ). The daily averages (SD) of pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and asthma cases were 12.5 (9.1), 24.3 (11.5), and 0.8 (1.4), respectively. The mean concentrations of PM 10 , PM c , and PM 2.5 in our study were 58.3, 21.0, and 37.8 \u00b5g/m 3 . The mean (SD) of temperature and relative humidity was 22.8 \u2022 C (5.9) and 81.8% (10.2%), respectively. Figure 2 shows the correlation plot of the air pollutants and meteorological variables in our sample. All the Pearson's correlation coefficients were statistically significant except for the correlation between NO 2 and O 3 . PM 10 was significantly and strongly correlated with PM c and PM 2.5 (Pearson's correlation coefficients: 0.81 and 0.93); NO 2 was moderately correlated with particulate matters (Pearson's correlation coefficients for PM 10 , PM c , and PM 2.5 : 0.78, 0.66, and 0.70). Meteorological variables were negatively correlated with air pollutants except for the positive correlation between temperature and O 3 . Table 2 exhibits the ER of pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and asthma outpatient visits associated with per 10 \u00b5g/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 , PM c , and PM 10 at lag03. The results revealed that size-specific particulate matter were significantly associated with pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and asthma, respectively, in singlepollutant models, where the ER of PM c was the largest, followed by that of PM 2.5 and PM 10 . The results were consistent and robust in two-pollutant models with further adjustment for SO 2 , NO 2 , and O 3 , except for those asthma models controlling for NO 2 .

In contrast, the effects of the size-specific particulate matter on asthma are less robust: the moving average lags of PM c , and PM 2.5 were still significantly associated with the ALRI outpatient visits, but the effects of lag0 to lag5 of PM c and PM 2.5 and different lags of PM 10 were non-significant or at borderline significant. Sensitivity analyses using the different degrees of freedom for splines of temporal trends and temperature showed a generally consistent pattern (Supplementary Table 2) . Table 3 presents the estimated ER with 95% CI of pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and asthma stratified by sex, age group, and season, where the bold numbers indicate the significant differences across strata. We observed that each 10 \u00b5g/m 3 increase in PM 10 , PM c , and PM 2.5 was consistently associated with significantly different effects on pneumonia outpatient visits by sex and season groups. Similar differential effects were observed for the bronchiolitis associated with increases in PM 10 and PM c by different season strata, but not for PM 2.5 . However, the differential effects across strata were much less significant for the asthma outpatient visits: it was only significantly different between the warm and cold seasons.

However, these results should be interpreted with caution as PM 2.5 , PM c , and PM 10 have different means and standard deviations: the mean of PM c in our sample (21.0 \u00b5g/m 3 ) was lower than the reference level (30 \u00b5g/m 3 ); the SD of PM c (9.9 \u00b5g/m 3 ) was much smaller compared with that of PM 2.5 (21.2 \u00b5g/m 3 ) and PM 10 (28.1 \u00b5g/m 3 ). Therefore, the ER of ALRI associated with PM c appeared to be the largest, which likely resulted from its smaller SD. We found a larger effect of particulate matter-ALRI association among men than women, which is similar to the results of the sex-specific effects of particulate matter pollution reported previously (19) . This may be due to the biological differences between men and women populations, such as hormones, sizes of airway diameters and lung sizes, and build, which will, in turn, result in the difference in the transport of pollutants and tissue deposition (17, 32) . In addition, the observed associations between particulate matter and ALRI were stronger during the cold season, which is in line with the several previous studies (26, (33) (34) (35) . There are several possible biological mechanisms, such as season-specific behavior, differences in PM 2.5 levels, constituent, and etiologic agents, which may be responsible for this seasonal difference.",

Our counterfactual approach calculated the difference between the observed true number of hospitalizations and the estimated number of hospitalizations in counterfactual scenarios (the WHO recommended levels of air pollutants). Because the concentration of air pollutants for each person was input into the statistical models of the counterfactual analysis, this empirical approach is not subject to the underlying statistical distributions of the air pollutants. Our counterfactual analysis suggested that reducing PM 2.5 to the WHO reference was associated with the largest potential decline in ALRI outpatient visits, followed closely by the reduction of PM 10 , while reducing PM c to the WHO reference is associated with the lowest potential for a decline in ALRI outpatient visits, which is likely explained by the fact that the mean level of PM c (21.0 \u00b5g/m 3 ) in our sample is lower than that of the WHO reference level (30 \u00b5g/m 3 ).",

For example, Wang et al. specifically focused on the association between the size-specific particulate matter and childhood pneumonia, and they reported a graded impact of the size-specific particulate matter on the childhood pneumonia (PM 1 > PM 2.5 > PM 10 ).

Second, a city-wide average concentrations of air pollution was used to represent the population exposure level, which could lead to exposure misclassification. Third, we included a relatively small number of asthma outpatient visits, which led to unstable point estimates and CIs for asthma. Fourth, since we used secondary data collected from the hospital administrative database, some important confounders (such as maternal smoking, prenatal care, and BMI) were not available to us.

Second, we used the counterfactual analyses to estimate the potential percent reduction in ALRI outpatient visits compared with the WHOrecommended levels. The results of counterfactual analyses have more substantial public health significance compared with ER, OR, and any other estimates associated with a fixed amount of increase in particulate matter (such as per 10 \u00b5g/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 ) (11) (12) (13) .",
