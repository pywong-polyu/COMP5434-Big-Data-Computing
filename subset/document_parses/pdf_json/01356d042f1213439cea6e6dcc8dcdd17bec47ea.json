It will be interesting to study its long-term protective efficacy. BCG, another approved immunomodulator is also being evaluated for the prevention of COVID-19, and it will be interesting to study its outcome as there are differences in the innate immune response generated by the two in terms of being a TLR agonist and in ligand presentation 4 .

Innate immune response is a conserved, prompt mechanism, which resists infections by recognizing the conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) of an infectious agent by pathogen recognizing receptors (PRR) like toll like receptors (TLR). It is relevant in infections by novel pathogens like SARS-COV-2 2 . A TLR2 agonist, heat killed Mycobacterium w (Mw), also known as Mycobacterium Indicus Pranii, is, an approved immunomodulator in India 3 and is used in the management of leprosy and other conditions.In a prospective open label cohort control study, we explored the efficacy of Mw in inducing resistance to the development of COVID-19 infection in HCW at a high risk of exposure, in a tertiary-healthcare set-up.MethodsThirty-two HCWs from the Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation andHematology were administered 0.1 ml Mw (Sepsivac, Cadila Pharmaceuticals, India)",

Of the 31, who developed COVID-19 infection, four required hospitalization. All belonged to the control group. Despite a greater number of exposures in the Mw group, only one out of 32 (3.13%) subjects had an RT-PCR confirmed mild COVID-19 infection. HR for developing COVID-19 in the control group compared to the Mw group was 19.025 (p=0.0038). Based on this study, the resistance to infection (protective efficacy) provided by Mw was 93.33% (p=0.0001; 95% CI 53.3-99.1).",
