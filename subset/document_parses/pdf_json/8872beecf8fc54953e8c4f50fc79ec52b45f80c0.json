A clearer understanding of the bidirectional communication between the parasympathetic nervous system and the immune system could lead to novel clinical interventions for inflammatory illnesses. The current study used a large (N \u00bc 836) nationally representative sample of adults in the United States to investigate the associations between resting parasympathetic modulation of the heart, indexed through both high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) and low frequency heart rate variability (LF-HRV), and six circulating markers of inflammation. Statistical analyses revealed robust inverse associations of HF-HRV with interleukin-6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen, with or without covariate adjustment. Similar inverse associations were observed between LF-HRV and IL6 and CRP. No significant associations were observed between HRV and either inflammatory adhesion molecules (E-selectin, intracellular adhesion molecule-1) or soluble IL6 receptor. Results are consistent with the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and suggest that parasympathetic modulation of inflammation through the vagus nerve may act on specific inflammatory molecules more than others.",

Evidence suggests that the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a particularly critical role in modulating inflammation (Borovikova et al., 2000) . Specifically, through rapid afferent and efferent signaling of the vagus nerve, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is involved in both monitoring current levels of inflammation and reducing production of inflammatory cytokines (Tracey, 2002) . Parasympathetic modulation of inflammation is accomplished through targeted production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which binds to nicotinic \u03b17 receptors (\u03b17 nAChRs) expressed by macrophages, leading to reduced production and recruitment of inflammatory molecules (Saeed et al., 2005) . This inhibition of inflammatory processes by parasympathetic outflow has been labeled the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (Tracey, 2002) .",

For instance, in humans greater resting PNS activity has been associated with lower levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines (Williams et al., 2019) , reduced cytokine production in response to ex-vivo blood stimulation with a bacterial endotoxin (Marsland et al., 2007) , and lower increases in serum cytokines during social threat (Alen et al., 2020) . Most studies have used measures of resting heart rate variability (HRV), which can be portioned into different frequency domains (Laborde et al., 2017) . High frequency HRV (HF-HRV) is a reliable marker of parasympathetic modulation of the heart through the vagus nerve (Cacioppo et al., 1994) . Low frequency HRV (LF-HRV) also reflects ANS activity, though LF-HRV appears to be influenced by both the PNS and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS; Berntson et al., 1997) and may also reflect non-ANS related cardiovascular activity (e.g., baroreflex sensitivity; Goldstein et al., 2011) .",

Specifically, resting HF-HRV was negatively associated with circulating interleukin-6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and white blood cell count (WBC), but not with interleukin-1 (IL1) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1). In addition, resting LF-HRV was negatively associated with IL6, CRP, and WBC, but not with fibrinogen, IL1, or TNF\u03b1. Too few studies were available to test associations between HRV and other inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-10, interferon-gamma; Williams et al., 2019) . These complex results suggest that parasympathetic modulation of inflammation may be stronger for specific inflammatory molecules. More research using large samples and multiple inflammatory markers could help clarify which inflammatory markers are linked to individual differences in parasympathetic activity.",

Specifically, sympathetic release of norepinephrine can have both pro-and anti-inflammatory effects, depending on characteristics of the targeted inflammatory cell (e.g., number of adrenergic receptors; Koopman et al., 2011) . Previous studies in humans have reported a positive association between overnight urinary norepinephrine output and peripheral inflammation (Hostinar et al., 2015) . Given these associations, it is surprising most studies investigating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway do not control for resting sympathetic activity. However, two relatively recent studies investigated HRV-inflammation links while controlling for SNS activity, indexed through urinary norepinephrine. Thayer and Fisher (2009) found inverse associations between HRV and CRP after controlling for urinary norepinephrine. In a more recent study, Cooper et al. (2015) examined the associations of both LF-HRV and HF-HRV with six inflammatory markers using a large nationally representative sample of adults from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. Results from this study revealed inverse relations of HF-HRV with both CRP and fibrinogen, and of LF-HRV with IL6, CRP, and fibrinogen, after controlling for a host of covariates including urinary norepinephrine. In addition, this study found comparable associations between indices of HRV and inflammation in males and females (Cooper et al., 2015) , in contrast to previous evidence (Thayer and Fisher, 2009) .",

The data used in the study by Cooper et al. (2015) came from MIDUS 2 Project 4, a subsample of MIDUS participants invited to provide biological data between 2004 and 2009. In 2012, data collection began on a separate sample of participants, called the MIDUS Refresher (MIDUS R) sample, meant to replenish the ongoing MIDUS study. Participants in the MIDUS R study engaged in the exact same study protocol and provided the exact same biological variables as the MIDUS 2 study, which presented an opportunity for direct replication of the Cooper et al. (2015) findings. The importance of replication studies for strengthening the reliability of biobehavioral science has recently been expressed by numerous researchers in the scientific community (e.g., NASEM, 2019; Zwaan et al., 2018) . The current study was designed to promote transparency and replicability in biobehavioral science by both (1) replicating previous findings, and (2) providing software script in supplemental material detailing statistical procedures used to analyze these open access data.",

Specifically, we expected to find negative associations of both indices of HRV (HF-HRV and LF-HRV) with IL6 and CRP, as well as negative associations between HF-HRV and fibrinogen. Whereas Cooper et al. (2015) observed associations between LF-HRV and fibrinogen, the meta-analysis by Williams et al. (2019) did not find this effect. We therefore did not have strong a priori expectations regarding this association. We expected to find weak or no evidence for an association of HRV with E-selectin, ICAM-1, and IL6r. In addition, based on a recent meta-analysis (Williams et al., 2019) we hypothesized that these associations would be similar for males and females.",

The current study utilized data from the resting baseline measure only, during which participants were asked to breath naturally, to not talk, and to try to relax. ECG data were digitized at 500 Hz by a 16-bit National Instruments analog-to-digital board and submitted to a custom-written program to generate an RR interval (RRI) time series. Ectopic beats or noisy signals were interpolated up to the equivalent of five consecutive RR intervals based on surrounding data. Longer segments were excluded from further analysis. Two 300-sec epochs from the resultant corrected RR interval time series were submitted to a Fast-Fourier transformation algorithm to estimate power in the low (0.04-0.15 Hz, LF) and high (0.15-0.40 Hz, HF) frequency bands based on method similar to that described by DeBoer et al. (1984) . RRI time series shorter than 300 s due to noise or excess ectopic beats also were analyzed if they were at least 180 s in N.V. Alen et al.",

IL6 was assayed from serum using a Quantikine\u00ae High-sensitivity ELISA kit #HS600B (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). CRP was measured in plasma using a BNII nephelometer from Dade Behring utilizing a particle enhanced immunonepholometric assay. Fibrinogen was measured in plasma using the BNII nephelometer (N Antiserum to Human Fibrinogen; Siemens, Malvern, PA). ICAM-1 was assayed from serum using a sandwich ELISA Quantikine\u00ae kit #SCD540 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). E-selectin was assayed from serum with a sandwich ELISA Quantikine\u00ae kit #SSLE00 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

After log transformation, outliers were observed in ICAM-1 (n \u00bc 7) and E-selectin (n \u00bc 1), defined as values more than 4 SD away from the mean; these values were Winsorized to the closest value within 4 SD of the mean. In order to test the association between HRV and inflammation, we conducted a series of multiple linear regressions, regressing each of the six inflammatory markers onto HF-HRV and LF-HRV individually, for a total of 12 regression models. Each regression model was performed in five steps. In step 1, inflammation was regressed onto HRV unadjusted for covariates. In step 2, the model was adjusted for urinary norepinephrine. In step 3, age, sex, race, BMI, menopausal status, smoking history, and exercise habits were added to the model as covariates. In step 4, health condition and medication regimen data were added to the model as covariates. In step 5, HRV residualized for respiration rate was used as the primary independent variable. In order to account for multiple comparisons (i.e., 12 models), test significance was determined using Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR; Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ; see supplemental Table S1 for FDR calculations). Lastly, we tested moderation by participant sex by creating interaction terms between each HRV index and sex and including this variable in the final model.

(2015) in the MIDUS 2 study and a recent meta-analysis (Williams et al., 2019) led us to hypothesize inverse associations of HF-HRV with IL6 and CRP and inverse associations of LF-HRV with IL6 and CRP. Based on previous findings, the potential association of HRV with fibrinogen was unclear. Analyses revealed that HF-HRV was inversely related to IL6, CRP, fibrinogen, and IL6r; however, after adjusting for covariates (urinary norepinephrine, age, sex, race, BMI, menopause, smoking, exercise, study site, health disorders, medication regimen, and respiration rate), and controlling for multiple comparisons, IL6r was no longer significantly related to HF-HRV. In addition, LF-HRV was inversely related to IL6, CRP, and fibrinogen. After adjusting for our panel of covariates and controlling for multiple comparisons, fibrinogen was no longer significantly related to LF-HRV. Overall, the other markers tested (ICAM-1 and E-selectin, IL6r) were not significantly related to either measure of heart rate variability. SNS activity has also been implicated in the regulation of inflammatory processes (Koopman et al., 2011) . Indeed, we found significant positive correlations of urinary norepinephrine with IL6, CRP, and fibrinogen, and a negative correlation between urinary norepinephrine and ICAM-1. Importantly, after controlling for urinary norepinephrine, the associations with HRV and inflammation remained significant, as previous studies have shown (Cooper et al., 2015; Thayer and Fischer, 2009) .",

Previous work has implicated TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, and IL6, in studies demonstrating nicotinic receptor \u03b17 as a mediator of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway output (Pavlov and Tracey, 2005; Wang et al., 2003) . However, in a recent meta-analysis (Williams et al., 2019) , both TNF\u03b1 and IL1 were not found to be associated with any measures of cardiac/autonomic physiology, citing a lack of studies with large enough sample sizes, and a scarcity of studies altogether. However, the meta-analysis revealed significant inverse relations of both IL6 and CRP with HF-HRV and LF-HRV. In our exploratory analyses (Supplemental Material Appendix 1), TNF\u03b1 showed a weak negative association with both HF-HRV and LF-HRV, but neither survived correction for multiple comparisons and adjustment for covariates.",

Together, these findings demonstrate a need for studies with larger sample sizes that assess a broader panel of multiple inflammatory markers to further explore mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory pathway in humans. Although the majority of the studies described, the present study included, are correlational, previous studies show a potential causal role of the vagus nerve as a regulator of inflammation in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Vagotomy in non-human animal models results in an increased immune response (Borovikova et al., 2000; Karimi et al., 2010) and vagal stimulation or use of \u03b17 nAChR agonists limits the release of inflammatory cytokines (Wang et al., 2004) . However, more recent studies of vagotomy in animals are proving this relationship to be more complex (Kobrzycka et al., 2019) , as communication between the immune system and brain was found to be largely preserved following vagotomy, via alternative compensatory mechanisms in the periphery (PGE2). In humans, a group of patients who underwent vagotomy showed significantly increased levels of ulcer disease, septicemia, and overall mortality in comparison to healthy controls (Peterson et al., 2012) . In a study of patients with various of forms of brain damage, the patient group with likely the most increased vagus nerve activity (those with intracranial hemorrhage, ICH) demonstrated the lowest cytokine production in response to ex-vivo stimulation of whole blood (Kox et al., 2012) . Further, bioelectronic stimulation of the vagus nerve has proven to be an effective treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders in humans (Bonaz et al., 2016; Koopman et al., 2016; Pavlov et al., 2020) .",

In addition, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as galantamine, have been approved to treat Alzheimer's disease but have begun to be examined in other disorders such as metabolic syndrome. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated galantamine to have anti-inflammatory effects (suppressing TNF\u03b1), suppress insulin levels, and modulate heart rate variability in patients with metabolic syndrome (Consolim-Colombo et al., 2017; Pavlov et al., 2018) .

First, the observed effect sizes were small (r's < 0.50) according to the definition by Cohen (1988) . However, small differences in circulating inflammation levels observed at a single timepoint could accumulate to meaningful differences in risk over the lifespan, particularly in individuals at high risk (Abelson, 1985) . Nevertheless, these results suggest other factors should be considered to fully explain variance in inflammatory processes. Second, although participants were asked to relax and breath naturally during the resting HRV measurement, it is possible that some individuals may have engaged in modulation of breathing rate, which could influence resting HRV measures. Adjusting for respiratory rate helps alleviate concerns over this potential limitation. Future studies could benefit from explicitly requesting participants to not engage in modulation of respiration. Third, the list of medical conditions and medication regimens included as covariates was extensive but not exhaustive. Considering the old age of some of our participants, and therefore the large range of possible health issues and medication taken, it is possible that our findings could be influenced by some illness or medication not accounted for in the current study. Future research may also benefit from testing moderation effects of illness and medication (i.e., does the relation between HRV and inflammation depend on medication regimen?). Lastly, the list of inflammatory markers in the current study was not exhaustive. Our exploratory analyses expanded upon the original study of Cooper et al. (2015; see Supplemental Appendix S2) to include IL10 and TNF\u03b1, resulting in eight inflammatory markers in total. Nevertheless, future research could benefit from including inflammatory markers that appear to be less common in studies of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (e.g., interleukin-2; Williams et al., 2019) .",
