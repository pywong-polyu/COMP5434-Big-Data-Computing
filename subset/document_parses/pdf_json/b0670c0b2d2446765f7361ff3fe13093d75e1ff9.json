            "text": "Myocarditis and myopericarditis may occur after COVID-19 vaccination with an incidence of two to twenty cases per 100,000 individuals, but underlying mechanisms related to disease onset and progression remain unclear. Here, we report a case of myopericarditis following the first dose of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in a young man who had a history of mild COVID-19 three months before vaccination. The patient presented with chest pain, elevated troponin I level, and electrocardiogram abnormality. His endomyocardial biopsy revealed diffuse CD68 + cell infiltration. We characterized the immune profile of the patient using multiplex cytokine assay and flow cytometry analysis. Sex-matched vaccinated individuals and healthy individuals were used as controls. IL-18 and IL-27, Th1-type cytokines, were highly increased in the patient with COVID-19 vaccine-related myopericarditis compared with vaccinated controls who experienced no cardiac complications. In the patient, circulating NK cells and T cells showed an activated phenotype and mRNA profile, and monocytes expressed increased levels of IL-18 and its upstream NLRP3 inflammasome. We found that recombinant IL-18 administration into mice caused mild cardiac dysfunction and activation of NK cells and T cells in the hearts, similar to the findings in the patient with myopericarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Collectively, myopericarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination may be associated with increased IL-18-mediated immune responses and cardiotoxicity.",

            "text": "Recently, myocarditis and myopericarditis cases following COVID-19 vaccination were reported in the United States and other countries (1) (2) (3) . The incidence was two to twenty cases per 100,000 persons who have received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccines, with the potential risk increased in individuals who received 2 nd dose of mRNA-based vaccine (3, 4) . Males between the ages of 16 and 29 years showed a higher incidence than other sex or age groups (3) . In some case reports, a considerable proportion of patients had a history of COVID-19 before they received the vaccine (2, 5, 6) . Most of the patients reported presented with chest pain, elevated cardiac troponin level, abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) with diffuse STsegment elevations, and slightly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (2, (5) (6) (7) (8) . The diagnosis of myocarditis or myopericarditis was usually confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) rather than an endomyocardial biopsy (9) . Similar to myocarditis cases, acute pericarditis is suspected once patients have chest pain and abnormalities on ECG, echocardiogram, or CMR after COVID-19 vaccination (9) . Pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccine developed in older patients later after vaccination compared with myocarditis or myopericarditis cases (4) . The majority of implicated cases of COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis have been mild and selflimiting. Few rare deaths have been reported in more fulminant presentations (10) (11) (12) .",

Vaccine-related myopericarditis has been rarely reported in the past, primarily after live-attenuated smallpox vaccine in the military population (15) . Rarely, the vaccination for influenza or hepatitis B has also been associated with myocarditis or myopericarditis (16) . The pathogenic process of community-acquired myocarditis, commonly caused by a viral infection, is driven by activated immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines (17) . Massive infiltration of T cells, myeloid cells, and eosinophils are histologically observed in the lymphocytic, giant cell, and eosinophilic myocarditis, respectively (18) . In COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-related myocarditis, endomyocardial biopsy findings have varied. Some studies showed myocardial infiltration of lymphocytes, myeloid cells, or mixed immune cell populations, whereas others did not find significant myocardial inflammation (2, 5, (10) (11) (12) . Meanwhile, autoantibodies against cardiac antigens have been detected in patients with community-acquired myocarditis, suggesting that activated B cells may play an important role in the initiation or progress of myocarditis (19) . However, in a case study of myocarditis after the COVID-19 vaccine, no circulating autoantibodies related to myocarditis were detected (20) .",

As a control, we used two groups: five healthy males and five males who received the first dose of another mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), in the past 2 to 3 days, experiencing no cardiac complications or other side effects. In multiplex assay analysis, a biologically relevant change was considered if the patient sample showed an increase or decrease of more than two folds compared to a median value of either control group. We found that Th1-type cytokines IL-18 and IL-27 were increased in the patient with COVID-19 vaccine-related myopericarditis compared to both healthy and vaccine control groups ( Figure 1D and Supplementary Table 1) . Recently vaccinated controls also showed increased IL-18 and IL-27 levels compared with healthy controls, but they were lower than those of the (D-F) Plasma cytokine and chemokine levels measured by multiplex cytokine assay in the patient with myopericarditis on days 3 (D3) and 4 (D4) after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. As controls, five healthy controls (Healthy) and five individuals who had been vaccinated in the past 2 to 3 days (Vaccine) were tested. patient sample collected on day 3 after the vaccination. Similarly, Th1-type chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were elevated in the patient with COVID-19 vaccine-related myopericarditis compared to healthy and vaccine controls ( Figure 1D and Supplementary Table 1 ). The vaccine controls exhibited a comparable level of CXCL9 and CXCL10 to healthy controls. The patient with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-associated myopericarditis presented increased levels of other Th1-type cytokines and chemokines (IFN-g, IL-7, IL-15, and CCL4), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12p40, and TNF-a), and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Ra and IL-10) compared with healthy controls (Figures 1E, F and Supplementary Table 1) . However, those cytokine levels in the patient were comparable to recently vaccinated controls. Thus, these data indicate that the patient with myopericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination had excessive Th1-type immune responses over vaccine-induced immune activation.",

We detected no significant antibody binding to the non-human primate heart tissue in the patient plasma, while positive control antibodies showed a strong binding (Supplementary Figure 5A) . In addition, we tested if this patient had anti-cardiac myosin autoantibodies, which were present in patients with community-acquired myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy, by using ELISA (28) . The patient had a negligible level of antibodies against cardiac myosin S2-16 and S2-28, comparable to normal healthy controls with no cardiac inflammation (Supplementary Figure 5B) . In the PBMC of the patient with myopericarditis after vaccination, the number of B cells was reduced compared to healthy and vaccinated controls, while plasma cells were comparable between groups ( Figure 4I and Supplementary Figure 5C Figure 5D) . The reduction of total B cell count in the patient with COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis could be temporarily caused by enhanced T cell immunity, not due to genetically defective humoral immunity. We found the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein IgA and IgG in the patient plasma by ELISA (Euroimmun), while they were not detected in controls who received the vaccine at the same time point (Supplementary Figure 5E ). In this patient, a history of COVID-19 three months before the vaccination likely induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production. Next, to investigate whether residual SARS-CoV-2 from the history of COVID-19 or cardiac S protein expression due to the mRNA vaccine is involved in myopericarditis in this patient, we tested the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S and nucleocapsid (N) genes in the endomyocardial biopsy by using RT-PCR. Neither viral gene was detected in the patient biopsy sample, suggesting no involvement of SARS-CoV-2 infection or cardiac S protein expression due to the vaccination in myopericarditis pathogenesis (data not shown).",

This is supported by the finding of no significant inflammatory cell infiltration in the endomyocardial biopsy from the patient, where showed only diffuse macrophages and monocytes. In cardiovascular disease patients, high IL-18 levels were associated with a risk of heart damage and death, supported by animal studies (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) . In vitro studies showed that IL-18 can directly induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and contractility reduction (27, 29) . In addition, it was reported that NLRP3 inflammasome expression, an upstream signal for IL-18 activation, was upregulated in patients with myocarditis or pericarditis (30, 31) . IL-27 is one of the cytokines elevated in patients with coronary artery disease, although it is unclear if IL-27 plays a pathogenic or protective role in the cardiovascular system (32) (33) (34) . In the immune system, IL-27 plays a dual role by activating NK cells and Th1 cells and simultaneously promoting anti-inflammatory cytokine production in other types of T cells (35) . CXCR3 ligands such as CXCL9 and CXCL10 are considered as biomarkers for heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases (36) . CXCL9 treatment has disrupted electrophysiology in cardiomyocyte in vitro culture, while no studies have reported if CXCL10 can directly damage cardiomyocytes (37) .",

In our study, we found that a level of Th2-or Th17-type cytokines in the patient with COVID-19 vaccine-related myopericarditis was comparable to healthy controls or lower than that of recently vaccinated controls. Thus, we concluded that Th2 cells, eosinophils, and Th17 cells are not involved in COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-related myopericarditis and that excessive Th1 immune activation might suppress Th2-and Th17-type immune responses in the patient with myopericarditis following the COVID-19 vaccine. In a case report by others, eosinophils within mixed inflammatory infiltration were observed in endomyocardial biopsy and autopsy specimens of patients with myocarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination (12) . However, those patients developed myocarditis at least 10 days after the vaccination, which is less typical than most cases reported and could suggest a different mechanism than the case in our report.",

In the patient with myopericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination, we found an increase of monocyte number and IL-18 production.

Previous clinical studies have suggested a detrimental role of IL-18 in various cardiovascular diseases (23) (24) (25) . Supportively, other studies have shown that IL-18 can directly damage cardiomyocytes by inducing hypertrophy and reducing contractility (26, 27) . Thus, elevated IL-18 production by circulating or heart-infiltrating monocytes and macrophages could directly cause cardiomyocyte injury in the patient with myopericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination, which was proven by high cardiac troponin levels and decreased left ventricular systolic function. Meanwhile, we found that IL-18 in vivo administration led to NK cell infiltration and activation in the myopericardium but not in the endomyocardium of mice, suggesting a contribution of NK cells to myopericardial inflammation. In myopericarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, a contribution of NK cells is unknown thus far. However, since NK cells are primarily and rapidly stimulated by IL-18, activated NK cells and their effector molecule production such as IFN-g, perforin, granzymes, and FasL may contribute to myopericarditis onset and progress. A case report of myocarditis after the mRNA-1273 vaccine showed increased NK cell count in the patient blood as well as our finding (20) . Due to well-known anti-viral function and Th1-type activity, NK cells have been considered to protect the heart from viral infection-induced myocarditis and eosinophil-associated autoimmune myocarditis in mice, but they are clinically different from COVID-19 vaccine-related myopericarditis (49, 50) . Our mouse experiment showed that neutrophils were a minor population in the na\u00efve heart, and their number was reduced after IL-18 treatment, suggesting no contribution of neutrophils to IL-18-driven cardiotoxicity. Supportively, in case reports by others, patients with myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccine presented no increase of blood neutrophil count (8) .",

Since SARS-CoV-2-infected patients showed activated monocyte NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and increased plasma IL-18 levels, S protein expression due to mRNA vaccination could cause IL-18 production in monocytes (52, 53) . Like the patient in our study, individuals who recovered from COVID-19 showed robust activation of CD8 + T cells after the first dose of mRNA vaccine than persons with no history of COVID-19 (54) . Meanwhile, an immune enhancement by lipid nanoparticles has been studied in vaccine-injected mice (55) .

The pathogenic role of IL-1 family members such as IL-1a, IL-1b, and IL-33 in pericarditis has been studied clinically and preclinically. The therapeutic use of IL-1a and IL-1b inhibitors in patients with pericarditis has improved pain and inflammation in clinical trials (65) . IL-1b treatment alone was able to cause cardiac dysfunction in mice, and IL-18 blockade by genetic mutation or inhibitor treatment prevented IL-1b-induced systolic dysfunction (66) . This indicates that IL-18 is a potent mediator of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, we and others have shown that in vivo administration of IL-33 alone can induce acute pericarditis by activating only innate immunity in mice (67, 68) . Thus, excessive activation of innate immune responses mediated by IL-18, an IL-1 family member, may contribute to myopericarditis development after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. In IL-18-injected mice, we found NK cell infiltration in the myocardium near the pericardium, where inflammation or cardiomyocyte damage likely occurred in the patient with myopericarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.",
