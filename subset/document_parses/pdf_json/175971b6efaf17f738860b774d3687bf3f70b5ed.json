We validated this serological assay by testing serum samples collected prior to the pandemic in 2019 from 834 individuals in the Penn 5 Medicine Biobank and 15 individuals who recovered from confirmed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infections in 2020 (Figure 2A-B). All 15 serum samples from COVID-19 recovered donors contained high, but variable, levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Figure 2A) and 10 of 15 samples contained detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgM (Figure 2B). Conversely, only 5 of 834 samples collected before the pandemic contained SARS-CoV-2 IgG and only 4 of 834 10 samples contained SARS-CoV-2 IgM; none contained both IgG and IgM. Together, this indicates that there is an overall false positive rate ~1% (9/834) in our serological assay. Consistent with our initial validation experiments, only 1 of 140 samples collected from pregnant women before the pandemic (from 2009-2012) possessed IgG or IgM SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Figure 2C-D). 15 We found that 80 of 1,293 (6.2%) pregnant women presenting for delivery from April 4 to June 3, 2020 possessed IgG or IgM SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Figure 2C-D; p = 0.003 comparing samples from pre-pandemic and pandemic pregnant women).

Serologic studies may provide a more accurate means of assessing population exposure to SARS-CoV-2 by identifying asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic as well as symptomatic infections. Further studies are needed to determine how the immune status of pregnant women compares to that of the general population. For example, parturient women may not represent individuals of different ages within the general population and women and5 men might mount different antibody responses upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 (8). Pregnant women of all demographics continue to seek medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, parturient women represent a unique population to assess differences in SARS-CoV-2 exposures in diverse populations. Our finding that Black/non-Hispanic and Hispanic/Latino women have higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rates relative to women of 10 other races suggest that there are race/ethnicity differences in SARS-CoV-2 exposures in Philadelphia and surrounding areas. Identification of factors that contribute to such differences in exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may inform public health measures aimed at preventing further infections. Prior perinatal COVID-19 studies have primarily focused on virus detection (i.e. nucleic 15 acid testing) in pregnant women and have not evaluated immunity (9-17). Two published studies to date have assessed SARS-COV-2 serology in pregnant women with active disease. A study of 6 parturient women in Wuhan, China with confirmed COVID-19 found all 6 women had elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM (18). A case report from Peru detailed a symptomatic pregnant woman with positive PCR testing and negative serology at presentation, 20 who developed severe respiratory failure necessitating delivery; her IgM and IgG turned positive 4 days after delivery (9 days after symptom onset) (19).
