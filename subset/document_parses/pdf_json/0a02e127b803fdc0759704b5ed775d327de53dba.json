The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro) has been implicated in playing important roles in virus maturation, dysregulation of host inflammation, and antiviral immune responses. The multiple functions of PLpro render it a promising drug target. Therefore, we screened a library of approved drugs and also examined available inhibitors against PLpro. Inhibitor GRL0617 showed a promising in vitro IC 50 of 2.1 \u03bcM and an effective antiviral inhibition in cell-based assays. The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro C111S in complex with GRL0617 indicates that GRL0617 is a non-covalent inhibitor and it resides in the ubiquitinspecific proteases (USP) domain of PLpro. NMR data indicate that GRL0617 blocks the binding of ISG15 C-terminus to PLpro. Using truncated ISG15 mutants, we show that the Cterminus of ISG15 plays a dominant role in binding PLpro. Structural analysis reveals that the ISG15 C-terminus binding pocket in PLpro contributes a disproportionately large portion of binding energy, thus this pocket is a hot spot for antiviral drug discovery targeting PLpro.",

The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is the etiological agent responsible for the pandemic, and it belongs to the beta coronavirus family [2] [3] [4] . Similar to the two beta coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, which have caused pandemic or epidemic in human history, the novel SARS-CoV-2 also causes severe acute respiratory syndromes 5, 6 . Unexpectedly, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to have more mild symptoms but much higher transmission rate 7, 8 , therefore it has caused the biggest catastrophe to the world healthcare since the Spanish flu in 1918-1920 9 . Four previously deemed promising antiviral drugs, i.e., Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir, and Interferon, showed no or little effect on hospitalized COVID-19 patients, in WHO global solidarity clinical trials 10 . Encouragingly, the UK started rollout of an mRNA vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNtech in early December 2020, with its long-term safety and efficacy to be assessed. Meanwhile, progress has been made in the discovery of antibodies for COVID-19. Therefore, anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs are urgently needed.",

The major function of Mpro is to cleave the viral polyproteins, which is critical for virus maturation, replication, and invasion. Several potent Mpro covalent inhibitors have been reported and their cocrystal structures provided potential opportunities for structurebased drug optimization [11] [12] [13] [14] . SARS-CoV PLpro is a cysteine protease with multiple major functions, including processing of the viral polyprotein chain for viral protein maturation, dysregulating host inflammation responses through deubiquitylation, and impairing the host type I interferon antiviral immune responses by removing interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) modifications [15] [16] [17] . ISG15 modification (ISGylation) is the covalent conjugation of ISG15 protein (MW = 17.1 kDa) to protein substrates and this process is known to inhibit virus replication [18] [19] [20] . SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (MW = 35.6 kDa), sharing 83% sequence identity with SARS-CoV PLpro, contains an Nterminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and a C-terminal ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) domain with implicated catalytic functions of cleaving ubiquitin (Ub) or ISG15 modifications from host proteins 21 .",

Accordingly, we describe our efforts in screening of a compound library of drugs approved by FDA or CFDA (China FDA) against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, and structural characterization of the interactions between a promising drug lead and PLpro. The co-crystal structure of PLpro in complex with the compound GRL0617 and its antiviral effect provided direct proof of druggability of PLpro and the mechanism of action of the compound. Further structural and biophysical analysis reveals that the C-terminus of ISG15 plays a dominant role in its binding with PLpro through extensive hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. Therefore, the ISG15-C-terminus binding cleft in PLpro is a hot spot for antiviral drug discovery.",

To repurpose existing drugs to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, we initiated screening of a 2040-compound library of drugs approved by FDA or CFDA against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (Supplementary Table 1 ). First, we set up a FRET assay to characterize the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro based on an established assay for SARS-CoV PLpro 26 . The recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and subsequently purified using his-tag chromatography and size exclusion chromatography ( Supplementary  Fig. 1) . A commercially available fluorogenic peptide substrate Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly-AMC (RLRGG-AMC), representing the Cterminal residues of ubiquitin, was used to report the enzymatic activity of PLpro. The first round of screening provided~30 compounds with over 50% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM. Because the FDA approved drug Tioguanine (6-TG) has been previously tested on SARS-CoV and MERS PLpro proteins with effective inhibitions 27,28 , we determined its potency against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and the IC 50 value was 72 \u00b1 12 \u03bcM, so we used it as a positive control throughout the screening. Hits from the first round of screening went into the second round of validation using the same enzymatic assay. After removing compounds with poor solubility, strong reactivity, or high intrinsic fluorescence, seven relatively potent compounds including 6-TG were measured for IC 50 . These seven drugs showed modest IC 50 values ranging from 29 to 91 \u03bcM ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Although these compounds can potentially provide a starting point for further optimization, their low potency implies a need of large amounts of resources and time input.",

To assess whether GRL0617 can inhibit the in cyto deubiquitinating and deISGylating activity of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, we transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids of PLpro and the ISGylation machinery (Ube1L, UbcH8, HECR5, and ISG15) and then treated with GRL0617 at different concentrations for 24 h. Our data (Fig. 1b) showed that the deubiquitinating activity of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is weak but its deISGylating activity is relatively strong, which is consistent with recent publications [30] [31] [32] [33] . SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is capable of reversing the ISGylation and polyubiquitination (to a much lesser extent) of cellular substrates (Fig. 1b) . Furthermore, addition of GRL0617 caused inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and resulted in partially recovered poly-ubiquitin-conjugates and ISG15conjugates (Fig. 1b) . Moreover, we further used interferon \u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) to induce the ISGylation in HEK293T cells which generated a remarkable amount of ISG15-conjugated cellular substrates (Fig. 1c, lanes 1 and 2) . The addition of 160 \u03bcM of GRL0617 alone to cell lysate had no observable effect to ISGylation (Fig. 1c, lanes 2 and 3) , which demonstrated the selectivity of the compound over other deISGylating enzymes in cells, such as USP18. Indeed, GRL0617 showed no inhibition effect on the recombinant mouse USP18 protein ( Supplementary Fig. 5g) , which is consistent with other studies 26, 31 . Further addition of purified SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (100 nM) to cell lysate efficiently reduced ISG15-conjugated proteins (Fig. 1c, lanes 2 and 4) . In contrast, addition of GRL0617 to cell lysate together with PLpro recovered the ISGylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1c , lanes 5-9) with significant band recovery seen at 40 \u03bcM of GRL0617. Clearly, GRL0617 inhibited the deISGylation activity of PLpro through an on-target effect.",

            "text": "The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in complex with GRL0617. A co-crystal structure would be crucial to understand the mechanism of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by GRL0617, therefore we set out to solve the co-crystal structure. Fig. 1 Inhibitory activity of GRL0617 against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. a The inhibitory activity of GRL0617 and compound 6 against PLpro was measured using the peptide RLRGG-AMC as a substrate. IC 50 was presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 3 independent experiments. b In-cell deISGylating (left) and deubiquitinating (right) activities of PLpro, HEK293T cells were transfected for 24 h with plasmids encoding GFP-PLpro, ISG15, and E1(Ube1L)/E2(UbcH8)/ E3(HECR5) enzymes, alone or in combination. Cells were treated for an additional 24 h with indicated concentrations of GRL0617. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin, anti-ISG15, and anti-GFP antibodies. GAPDH served as a loading control. A representative from three independent experiments is shown. c HEK293T cells were treated with or without 500 U/mL interferon \u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) for 48 h. The cell extracts were incubated with purified recombinant PLpro (100 nM) and indicated concentrations of GRL0617 for 60 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-ISG15. A representative from three independent experiments is shown. d Antiviral activity of GRL0617 on SARS-CoV-2 and the cytotoxicity of GRL0617 on Vero E6 cells. Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 using a multiplicity-of-infection (MOI) of 0.01. The quantification of absolute viral RNA copies (per mL) in the supernatant at 48 h post-infection was determined by qRT-PCR analysis. The cytotoxicity of GRL0617 on Vero E6 cells was measured using CCK8. All data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 3 independent experiments. e EC 50 was presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 3 independent experiments, the cytopathic effect (CPE) analysis revealed an EC 50 of 21 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM. However, the crystals of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 PLpro were difficult to grow. Therefore, we turned to grow co-crystals of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro C111S in complex with GRL0617 by incubating the compound with the protein before setting up crystal trays. The obtained co-crystal diffracted at 3.2 \u00c5 (Fig. 2a -e and Supplementary Table 2 ). When our manuscript was in the review process, a few groups also reported the co-crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and GRL0617 or its analogs 34, 35 . The crystal of PLpro/GRL0617 belongs to the space group I4 1 22 with one protein molecule in each asymmetric unit. SARS-CoV-2 PLpro has two domains, i.e., the N-terminal UBL domain and the Cterminal USP domain (Fig. 2a) . Based on the B factor analysis, the palm and thumb regions in the USP domain have lower B factor values than the UBL domain and the fingers region of the USP domain, indicating that the palm and thumb regions are relatively more rigid than rest of the structure. As shown in the 2Fo-Fc electron density map (Fig. 2a , b) as well as in the difference Fo-Fc electron density map ( Supplementary Fig. 4b) , GRL0617 resides in a pocket in the palm region of PLpro. GRL0617 is apart from the catalytical triad (including S111 in place of C111, H272, and D286) of PLpro with a minimum distance of 7.5 \u00c5 to S111 (from the methyl of the 4-Methylbenzenamine moiety of GRL0617 to the sidechain oxygen of S111). Therefore, GRL0617 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in a non-covalent manner. The GRL0617bound PLpro structure is overall similar to the available apostructure of PLpro C111S (PDB 6WRH) with a backbone RMSD of 0.76 \u00c5, except for two residues on the BL2 loop, i.e., Y268 and Q269 (Fig. 2d) . Upon binding to GRL0617, the sidechains of Y268 and Q269 shifted toward GRL0617 to form polar and hydrophobic interactions with the compound and stabilized its binding (Fig. 2d) . Specifically, the sidechain oxygen of Y268 forms a hydrogen bond with the amino group on the benzene ring of GRL0617, and another hydrogen bond of the backbone amino group of Q269 with the carbonyl oxygen of GRL0617 (Fig. 2b, include the hydrogen bonds between D164 and the amide NH of GRL0617, as well as between Y264 and the carbonyl oxygen of GRL0617. In addition, hydrophobic integration also contributed to the binding of GRL0617 to PLpro, e.g., the naphthalene group of GRL0617 is involved in the interactions with aromatic residues Y264 and Y268, and the hydrophobic sidechains of P247 and P248 (Fig. 2b, c) . Since GRL0617 is capable of inhibiting both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is of interest to understand its selectivity on coronaviral PLpro proteins from a structural biology perspective. It has been reported that naphthalene-based compounds have low to zero potency toward MERS PLpro 36, 37 . The superposition of GRL0617 on a surface model of the MERS PLpro structure 37 indicated that the original pocket in MERS PLpro might be too shallow to allow GRL0617 to bind with extensive contacts, and the naphthalene moiety of GRL0617 would also be in a steric clash with T249 of MERS PLpro (Supplementary Fig. 5c ). In contrast to SARS and SARS-CoV-2, the BL-2 loop of MERS is one residue longer, but it lacks the critical Y268 of SARS-CoV-2 which played a critical role in encircling GRL0617 in the cocrystal structure ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . The extra residue of MERS PLpro may rearrange the hydrogen-bond interaction network of the BL2 loop and the lack of the aromatic tyrosine clearly resulted in the removal of the T-shaped \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and van der Waals interactions with the naphthalene group of GRL0617 ( Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 5a -e). Our enzymatic assay confirmed the lack of inhibition of MERS PLpro by GRL0617 or compound 6, which is consistent with our structural analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 5f ) and a recent study 31 .",

            "text": "GRL0617 is a protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitor revealed by NMR. Because GRL0617 is a non-covalent inhibitor binding in the USP domain, i.e., the catalytic domain of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, it is of interest to see if GRL0617 would disrupt the interactions between ISG15 or Ub and PLpro. Solution state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was employed to characterize the binding of ISG15 or Ub to PLpro as well as the perturbation of their bindings by GRL0617. 2-D NMR 1 H, 15 N-HSQC spectrum of 15 N-ISG15 (0.1 mM) showed typical features for a wellfolded protein with well-dispersed cross peaks (Fig. 3a) . The addition of 0.15 mM SARS-CoV-2 PLpro into 0.1 mM 15 N-ISG15 caused drastic peak broadening and peak intensity loss, which is a characteristic of PPIs in the intermediate chemical exchange regime (Fig. 3b) . Increasing concentrations of GRL0617 were added into the mix of 0.1 mM 15 N-ISG15 and 0.15 mM SARS-CoV-2-PLpro, a dose-dependent response of peak intensity recovery was evident, which suggested that GRL0617 competes with ISG15 for the binding site in PLpro, and blocks the binding of ISG15 to PLpro (Supplementary Fig. 6a ). The superposition of the HSQC spectra of 0.1 mM 15 N-ISG15 only and the 0.1 mM 15 N-ISG15/0.15 mM PLpro/0.25 mM GRL0617 mixture showed that these two spectra are essentially identical ( Supplementary  Fig. 6c ), which indicated that GRL0617 is a potent binder to PLpro and almost completely abolished the binding of ISG15 to PLpro at a molar ratio of 1.67 (0.25 mM/0.15 mM). No peak shifting was observed in the superimposed HSQC (Supplementary Fig. 6b ), suggesting that GRL0617 is a bona fide binder of PLpro rather than ISG15 because the HSQC spectrum of 15 N-ISG15 is not disturbed at all by 2.5 excess molar ratio (0.25 mM/ 0.10 mM) of GRL0617.",

Titrations of PLpro into 15 N-Ub caused minimal peak shifting or peak broadening even at a high molar ratio of 3 ( Supplementary Fig. 7) , showing much weaker binding for PLpro with monoUb compared with ISG15. Consequently, GRL0617 was not further titrated into the 15 N-Ub/ PLpro mixture.

However, the superimposed 1 H, 15 N-HSQC also indicates that the interactions between ISG15 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro were abolished by removal of the C-terminus of ISG15, as minimal peak shifting or peak broadening were observed for 15 N-ISG15-\u0394C6/SARS-CoV-2 (molar ratio = 1:1.5) as compared with the massive peak broadening for 15 N-ISG15-FL/SARS-CoV-2 (molar ratio = 1:1.5) (Fig. 4a, b) . Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments confirmed that removal of the C-terminus of ISG15 is detrimental to the binding of ISG15 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (Fig. 4c) 32 , respectively. Further structural analysis of the human ISG15 C-UBL-PA/SARS-CoV-2 PLpro reveals that the PLpro backbone of L162, G163, Y268, C270, and G271 as well as sidechains of D164, R166, E167, and Y264 were involved in the interactions with the C-terminus of ISG15 through hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions.

Both D164A and E167A showed impaired activity on Ub and ISG15 cleaving (Fig. 4e) . The cleavage of peptide substrate RLRGG-AMC also indicated diminished enzymatic activities for these mutants. These two mutants did not show observable activity on Ub-AMC at 1 \u03bcM substrate concentration, presumably because SARS-CoV-2 PLpro cleaves Ub-AMC almost 10-fold less efficiently than ISG15-AMC 30 .",

Comparing these two structures, it is clear that the majority of the interactions between ISG15 and PLpro is from the C-UBL domain of ISG15. In two recent studies 31,32 , the PLpro residues V66, F69, Y171, and N156 were reported for interacting with the N-or C-globular domains of ISG15 31, 32 . In addition, intermolecular interactions with the C-terminus of ISG15 involve PLpro residues G163, D164, E167, R166, Y264, Y268, and G271 (Fig. 5a, b and Supplementary Fig. 10 ). The backbone of G163, Y268, G271 and the sidechains of D164, R166, E167, Y264 formed hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with PLpro ( Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 10c) . By comparing the structures of apo-and ISG15-bound SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, a shift of the BL2 loop of PLpro was observed (Fig. 5c-e) . In apo-SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, the ISG15-C-terminus binding pocket takes an open conformation. Upon binding to ISG15, the PLpro BL2 loop shifts toward the substrate, i.e., the C-terminus of ISG15, and firmly holds the C-terminus through a hydrogenbond and electrostatic interaction network (Fig. 5) . Using the sidechain OH of Y268 as a reference, the BL2 loop shifted 4.5 \u00c5 to encircle the C-terminus of ISG15 (Fig. 5e) , which also happened to the binding of GRL0617 in the same pocket (Fig. 2d) .

Our studies provided the mechanism of action for GRL0617.

Recent structural analysis reported that the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro S1 site is mainly for high ISG15 activity while the S2 site determines substrate selectivity 31, 32 . In our study, we show that the short and linear C-terminal tail of ISG15 dominates its binding with PLpro. Because the tail is short and flexible, it offers transient and reversible interactions with its binding partner, i.e., PLpro in this case, which ensures optimal enzyme efficiency and high enzymatic turnover. Since the C-terminus of Ub is also heavily involved in its interactions with MERS or SARS-CoV PLpro 16, 41 , primarily interacting with the C-terminus of Ub or ISG15 could be a general strategy for viral DUBs to attack host immune system.",

Small-molecule drugs often occupy hot spots on PPI interfaces and inhibit target proteins 46 . Because PLpro is a viral DUB with Ub and ISG15 cleavage functions, we compared our co-crystal structure with the structures of known USP7 and USP14 inhibitors to see if they share the same binding sites. Indeed, several non-covalent USP7 or USP14 inhibitors occupy the same pocket in the USP domain (Fig. 6 ) and block the binding of the C-terminus of Ub [47] [48] [49] 50 and GRL0617 reside in the same pocket encircled by the BL2 loop (Fig. 6a, c) . The superposition of all these DUB inhibitors on PLpro (Fig. 6d) , shows that they are all at the same Ub or ISG15 C-terminus binding cleft, illustrating arguably the most important pocket in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro for the discovery of PPI inhibitors. In addition, analysis of available co-crystal structures of inhibitorbound DUBs suggests that stabilization of the inactive conformations of DUB 51 , and/or structural plasticity of the BL1/BL2 loops in DUB are also potential mechanisms of inhibition 52 . Since several independent high-throughput screening assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 using approved drugs have been unsuccessful 32,53 , structure-based drug discovery for this hot spot in PLpro and optimization of GRL0617 or its analogs with PLpro would be a promising approach for combating COVID-19. Recently reported covalent peptidic inhibitors targeting the active C111 also bind in this pocket in PLpro 33 .",
