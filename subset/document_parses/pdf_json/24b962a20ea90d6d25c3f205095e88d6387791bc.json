However, deciding whether and when a patient should be intubated is complex, especially in COVID-19 patients who commonly exhibit severe hypoxemia without clinical signs of respiratory failure (the so-called silent hypoxemia) [2] . While clinical signs of respiratory failure seem to be universally acknowledged as intubation criteria [3] , their precise definition is lacking. Some authors have consequently used definite thresholds to guide intubation [4] , but this approach is debated [5] as an individualized strategy may be more adequate. In our ICU, only COVID-19 patients showing persistent signs of respiratory distress associated with profound hypoxemia were intubated.",
