At first, fabrics were sensitized with citric acid then the formation of Cu 2 O particles was done by Fehling solution method. In second step, the cuprous oxide particles were deposited on cotton fabrics. Three different types of reducing agents with different concentrations were selected to make the Cu 2 O particles. Surface morphology and presence of metals were analysed by scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, FTIR, EDS and XRD. The antibacterial activity of cuprous oxide coated fabrics was tested against qualitative and quantitative measurements. The strongest antibacterial effect was found for the fabrics coated with cuprous oxide particles reduced with sodium hydrosulphite at 1 g/l. Furthermore, the utility of hygienic antimicrobial developed fabrics were analysed for the comfort properties regarding air permeability and stiffness. At the end, durability of coating was confirmed by measuring the antibacterial properties and SEM analysis after washing.",

            "text": "Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are on the rise despite effodfrts to decrease them. These infections develop in patients during their stay and continuous concern with hospital. They are not only costly to treat, but more importantly, cause human suffering and even death. HAIs cause an estimated 100,000 deaths annually and account for up to $45 billion in health-care costs [1, 2] . A major source of cross infection is contaminated (bacteria and viruses) fabrics in hospitals. The most common textile coverage used in a specific hospital area (surgical, ICUs and patient wards and rooms) included surgical gowns, drapes, curtains, panel covers, wall papers/ sheets coverage, shoes mats, outlet covers, seat chair covers, table covers, patient and doctors socks etc. [3] . The patients, medical and common staff all are carrier of hospital acquired infections. The current interest has focused on high-touch textile based surfaces and their ability to serve as reservoirs for pathogenic microorganisms, including Staphylococcus Aureus, Clostridium Difficile, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci [4, 5] . Instead of bacteria, among most pathogenies the human infected viruses also contribute massively in hospital born infections. Adding fuel to the fire, bacteria (after Ethicillin now Methicelline resistant Staphylococcus Aureus) and viruses (a new strain called SARS-CoV-2) increasingly are becoming resistant to lastresort drugs. The rate of transmission of infection is very high and mainly spread during close contact and via respiratory droplets discharge and by touching a contaminated surface [6] . The risk can be increased when individuals have continuous and close contact with animals; also, climate change. The tragedy is that infected person have been visiting the places and remain in touch with surfaces and people. It becomes too late when a person realised about infection and till that time infection has delivered to many places, community or even to family members [7] [8] [9] . The only way to avoid from life threatening pathogens is to kill/ inhibit them before transmitting inside any human body. That is why the selection of antibacterial/antiviral common material used in daily life is necessary. A very quick and fast option to inactive the viruses and bacteria within a minute is the use of surface disinfectants with 62-71 % alcohol, or bleaching agents containing 0.5 % hydrogen peroxide and 0.1 % sodium hypochlorite [10] . The alkali soaps (pH over 12) are working as well very efficiently. Hygiene standards for surface cleanliness, based upon food processing industry standards also proposed [11] . Some new technologies, such as the use of UV light units and various hydrogen peroxide (HP) systems [12] , can effectively decontaminate hospital rooms. However, even when improved hand washing compliance and diligent surface hygiene disinfection are combined, hospital acquired infections (HAIs) are still a serious health issue. All the above approaches including hygiene hand washing, UV light, surface disinfection and HP systems have one thing in common, they are episodic. or one-time approaches. Therefore, as soon as the decontamination process ends, the microbial contaminants can again begin to accumulate [13] .",

            "text": "The researchers have been using different types of antimicrobial finishing on hospital textiles based on the coating of inorganic metal oxides. The most common and particular interest among them are micro/nano particles of Ag, Cu, TiO 2 , ZnO, MgO, CuO and Cu 2 O etc. [7, 14] . They are not only stable under harsh process conditions but also generally regarded as odourless work wear. Copper based materials are of most reliables because they are not only effective against microbes (within two hours) but is the only material which is most effective against the viability of pathogenic viruses (coronavirus within four hours). Copper, its ions and alloys have demonstrated excellent antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal activity against a wide range of pathogens [7] [8] [9] . The antibacterial properties of coper-based finishes are especially dependent on their shapes and sizes and to assure a uniform size distribution of particles over the textile structure. In recent years, the copper and cuprous oxide particles have attracted so much attention in many potential applications in catalysis, cooling fluid or conductive inks, heat transfer systems, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral agents. Anita et al. [15] carried out a study to impart the copper oxide nanoparticles on fabric for achieving antimicrobial properties. The antibacterial property of the coated fabric was determined quantitatively and qualitatively using AATCC 100 and 147 test methods, respectively [15] . In another research Ali et al. [16] coated the copper oxide nanoparticles on cotton fabric to achieve the antimicrobial properties. The copper oxide particles have very low stability and antimicrobial properties are affected. They can easily convert to different coper based compounds like copper carbonate (greenish), coper sulphate CuS etc. in different environment conditions. The resulting compounds formed by copper oxide particles are more toxic and cause acute poisoning some time [16] . Among copper based (CuO, Cu, Cu 2 O) anti-microbial agents the cuprous oxide particles are extremely regarded due to their optical, catalytic, mechanical, and, low cost preparation. The cuprous oxides are more stable, effective and beneficial regarding antibacterial properties. They are easily reducible and soluble in alkaline conditions. The antibacterial properties of copper-based finishes are especially dependent on their shapes and sizes and to assure a uniform size distribution of particles over the textile structure. CuO ",

Figure 6, 7 and 8 shows the clear zones of inhibition around all fabric samples after 24 h of incubation in dark at 37\u00b0C. The zone of inhibition was less for the cuprous oxide coated fabrics reduced by glucose. The cuprous oxide coated fabrics reduced by sodium hydrosulphite showed the most significant antibacterial zone to E. coli and S. aureus. The zone of inhibition test was repeated three times for each sample and the average value against each reducing agent is presented in Figure 6 , 7 and 8. These results showed that the deposited cuprous oxide particles present the strong sterilization to the E. coli and S. aureus due to the free standing of the particles. However, Staphylococcus aureus depicted the highest sensitivity as compared to Escherichia coli. The zone of inhibitions for Staphylococcus aureus increased from 5 to 7 mm, while for Escherichia coli it increased from 4 to 6 mm with increase in sodium hydrosulphite concentration. What is noteworthy is that the annulus of the inhibition zone increases with the increase in concentration of reducing agent. In other words, the prepared fibres with more cuprous oxide particles with increase in the concentration of reducing agents. This is indicating that more cuprous oxide contents will more influence the antibacterial activity, which is similar to the previous study [7] .",

Air permeability of the untreated fabric is about 130 mm/s while the air permeability for all other cuprous oxide nanoparticles coated fabrics is in the range of 123 to 126 mm/s. Showing that there is a minor decrease in air permeability even after depositing the cuprous oxide nanoparticles. There are two factors responsible for this phenomenon. Firstly, there may be a relaxation shrinkage in the fabric structure due to dipping cuprous oxide nanoparticles solution, causing the yarns to come close and hinder the flow of air. Secondly, during the application of nano particles, have deposited on the yarn structure and interstices, reducing the fabric air gap spacing (pore size). The fabric pore size has a direct relation with the air permeability of the fabric. Therefore, reduction in pore size has caused a decrease in the air permeability of the fabric. The spun yarns of cotton have a low uniformity and hairiness, which cause resistance to the flow of air and leading to low air permeability. It is the beauty of nanoparticles that they will cover more surface area over the yarn but will not entrap in the spaces between the fabric structures.",

It is clear from the given values that there is almost 50 % decrease in zone of inhibition after washing. This shows that prepared samples are effective against the pathogens even after sever washing. Furthermore, the trend was also justified from the SEM analysis after washing (for the samples G1, A1 and S1) as shown in Figure 16 . The retention of particles over the surface of fabric reinforced the fact that particles are firmly attach to the fibers and interspaces.",

A total of nine hygienic multifunctional textile samples were developed using nanoparticle of cuprous oxide particles along with varying the concentrations of three different reducing agents. Surface morphology and existence of metals were analysed by scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, FTIR, EDS and XRD. The antibacterial activity of cuprous oxide coated fabrics were tested against qualitative and quantitative measurements. The strongest antibacterial effect were found for the fabrics coated with cuprous oxide particles reduced with sodium hydrosulphite at 1 g/l. Furthermore, the developed fabrics were analysed for comfort properties regarding air permeability and stiffness. The particles were so fine they do not stop the pores of fabrics, hence we make sure the air permeability, while stiffness was improved as well. At the end, durability of deposition was confirmed by measuring the, antibacterial properties and SEM analysis after washing. The retention of particles over the surface of fabric reinforced the fact that particles are firmly attach to the fibers and interspaces. Developed process very easy, less in cost and provide odorless work wear. The successful application of cuprous oxide coated fabrics explained their potential applications in field of medical textiles to develop the antibacterial surgical drapes, pants, socks, panels, bed sheets, surgical gowns, curtains, panel covers, wall papers/ sheets coverage, shoes mats, outlet covers, seat chair covers, ",
