By July 2021, almost half of the adult US population had fully been vaccinated, with 56% of adults receiving at least one COVID-19 vaccination [2] . A crucial driver for COVID-19 vaccinations in the US has been the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. This program authorizes certain retail pharmacies, called pharmacy partners, to receive a COVID-19 vaccine supply directly from the federal government, and has been implemented in over 40,000 retail pharmacies across the United States [3] . Since the program launched in February 2021, approximately 99 million COVID-19 vaccinations have been administered in retail pharmacy settings, highlighting the pharmacists' role as a key factor in the federal government's COVID-19 vaccination strategy [3] .",

While over half of US adults report receiving at least one vaccine, uptake lags sorely behind the national goal of 80% [2] , and the average number of daily vaccinations has declined by approximately 85% since April 2021 [4] . The Kaiser Family Foundation reported that the percentage of individuals who had received one dose of vaccine or intended to do so increased from 61% to 64% from March to April 2021, or by only three percentage points [5] . Given pharmacy accessibility and existing federal resource allocation, improved pharmacy-based vaccination services may increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. To improve existing services, a greater understanding of barriers to engagement with vaccination efforts among pharmacies is needed. Understanding barriers to pharmacists offering COVID-19 vaccination can inform pointed interventions to improve vaccine provision in the pharmacy setting.",

Additionally, rurality and fragmented access to vaccines may impact COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Notably, Mississippi has the second-lowest rate of COVID-19 vaccinations in the country [4] . While 47.2% of adults have received at least one vaccine dose, only one-third of the total population is fully vaccinated [8] . Gaps in COVID-19 vaccination status and the opportunity for pharmacist involvement highlights the need to explore Mississippi pharmacists' engagement in COVID-19 vaccine administration and barriers to vaccination during the pandemic. This study aims to describe the engagement of pharmacists in COVID-19 vaccine administration in Mississippi, identify barriers to pharmacist engagement in COVID-19 vaccinations across Mississippi, and assess the influence of pharmacist and practice site factors on vaccination initiation in practice settings where vaccinations are provided across Mississippi.",

The survey was distributed via email to pharmacists through four Mississippi professional pharmacy organizations: Mississippi Pharmacists Association, Magnolia State Pharmaceutical Society, Mississippi Independent Pharmacy Association, and Mississippi Society of Health-System Pharmacists. Pharmacists whose emails were on-file with each professional organization received email invitations to complete the survey. The survey was distributed to approximately 3500 pharmacists beginning in April 2021 and was available for completion for approximately four weeks. After initial dissemination, no reminders to complete the survey were sent. Respondents who completed the survey were given the option to be entered into a raffle to receive one of two USD 200 gift cards as incentives to complete the survey. The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of University of Mississippi (protocol code 9x-003-1 and approved 22 April 2021).",

Almost half of responding pharmacists were less than forty-one years old (n = 111, 47.7%) and just over half were female (n = 130, 55.8%). Most surveyed pharmacists indicated that they practiced in a community pharmacy setting (n = 157, 67.4%). Sixty-two percent (n = 145) of responding pharmacists indicated that they were trained as Doctors of Pharmacy (PharmDs), and 35.6% (n = 83) indicated that they were trained as registered pharmacists (RPh). Of 233 total responses, 179 pharmacists responded to the question regarding weekly prescription volume. Weekly prescription volume varied, with a small percentage (10.6%) filling more than 4001 prescriptions per week in their pharmacy. ",

Balancing supply and demand for the COVID-19 vaccine for individual pharmacies is especially challenging in the face of vaccination expiration and patient vaccination hesitancy. One pharmacist noted that, \" . . . it has become very overwhelming with making sure we do not waste doses while also having vaccine available for patients who want to get it . . . \", while another noted that, \"It is becoming increasingly difficult to not waste vaccine and the main factor seems to be lack of interest from patients.\"",

Now I feel like everyone that was waiting to get it here has gotten it somewhere else.\" Pharmacists noted that the delay to stock the COVID-19 vaccination in independent pharmacies, especially in rural settings, where independent pharmacies may be the only potential vaccination providers, may have impeded vaccine administration and put rural populations at risk. One pharmacist stated, \"In a state like Mississippi with many rural communities many people did not have access to the vaccine early because there were not sites locally . . . Independent community pharmacies could have accelerated the process of vaccine connections in rural communities.\" Overall, independent pharmacists noted frustration with the poor or slow distribution to their pharmacies.

This study found that the greatest identified barrier to COVID-19 vaccination among pharmacists practicing at settings that offered vaccine services was patient willingness. The thematic analysis of comments regarding COVID-19 vaccination corroborates vaccine hesitancy, defined as a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite available services [11] , as a principal issue in COVID-19 uptake in Mississippi. Pharmacists suggested that patients do not wish to be vaccinated, or that they endorse vaccine misinformation. This finding is likely not unique to Mississippi. A lack of public confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine in the US is a chief concern. In fact, up to one-third of US adults do not plan to be vaccinated [12] . Among individuals who refuse the vaccine, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 53% of unvaccinated surveyed adults indicated that vaccine newness or concern over side effects are major barriers to uptake [13] . The same survey found that 38% of respondents do not believe that they need the vaccine [13] . While discouraging, it should be noted that vaccine hesitancy is fluid, and that only 11% of the Kaiser Family Foundation survey respondents indicated that their main reason for vaccine delay was vaccine refusal [13] .",

The 5C model of vaccination hesitancy notes that psychological drivers of vaccine uptake behavior include confidence, complacency, convenience, risk calculation, and collective responsibility [14, 15] . Pharmacists have the training and opportunity to work with patients to build confidence, reduce the patient-perceived vaccine risk, and promote collective responsibility for COVID-19 vaccination [16] . Professional pharmacy organizations have recognized the important role that pharmacists can play in promoting COVID-19 vaccine uptake and have released training resources for pharmacists to overcome COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) created the Vaccine Confident website (available online: www.vaccineconfident.pharmacist.com; accessed on 29 July 2021), which provides information on promoting vaccine uptake among a variety of communities and provides opportunity for continuing education credit on various topics surrounding vaccine hesitancy, including motivational interviewing and strategies for recommending vaccines [17] . The American Society of Health Systems Pharmacists (ASHP) has also released continuing education on addressing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy [18] . While overcoming vaccine hesitancy may seem daunting or time-consuming to many pharmacy practitioners, pharmacists are in a unique position to provide helpful information, reach out to communities, and overcome hesitancy. Additionally, training and resources are available to assist in this important task. Pharmacists should be informed on how to overcome vaccine hesitancy, not only for the health of their practices, but for the health of their communities.",

This may indicate a need for other pharmacy staff members, such as pharmacy technicians, to either participate in vaccination delivery or chart review for vaccine indications. Notably, the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board and the American Pharmacists Association worked together to develop a pharmacy technician vaccination certification program, which launched in February 2021 [19] .

While the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination allowed broad access to COVID-19 vaccinations across the United States, it may have represented a misstep for rural wellness. A lack of attention to gaps in care among rural spaces potentially perpetuated the poor vaccine uptake among these communities, which are typically older, poorer, and sicker than urban counterparts [23] . While pharmacists may influence COVID-19 vaccination uptake by leveraging pharmacy technician partners and providing education to overcome vaccine hesitancy, these efforts may be diminished by a lack of convenient or feasible spaces for rural patients to receive vaccinations. This missed opportunity for rural health should inform future broad vaccine dissemination interventions, and highlights the potential need for mobile vaccination clinics across states with pockets of hard-to-reach populations [24] .",

Leveraging pharmacy technician partners in vaccination administration, documentation, and billing may alleviate logistical barriers related to COVID-19 vaccine administration, and may allow for an increased COVID-19 vaccination uptake.
