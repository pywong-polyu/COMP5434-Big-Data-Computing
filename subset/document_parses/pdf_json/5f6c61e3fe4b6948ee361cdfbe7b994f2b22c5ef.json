Most HIV studies view Latino communities as a monolithic group, ignoring racial and sexual diversity. This analysis examines PrEP-related outcomes including eligibility, first prescription, and second prescription across race and sexual identity in a sample of Latino cisgender men (n = 8271) who sought services from a healthcare network in Chicago in 2012-2019. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios. Latino-only participants had lower odds of PrEP eligibility and first prescription compared to White-Latino participants. No other significant differences by race were detected. While bisexual participants had equivalent odds of PrEP eligibility, they had lower odds of first PrEP prescription compared to gay participants. Heterosexual participants also had lower odds of PrEP eligibility and initiation. Future research should address unique factors shaping PrEP-related outcomes among diverse Latino populations.",

            "text": "While the number of new HIV diagnoses in the US continues to decrease over time [1] , men who have sex with men (MSM 1 ) still make up the largest proportion of new diagnoses. For example, in 2018, MSM accounted for 69% of all new HIV diagnoses in the US [2] . In addition, Black and Latino MSM are disproportionately affected by HIV relative to White MSM. In 2018, Black and Latino MSM accounted for 37% and 30%, respectively, of all new HIV diagnoses among MSM in the US, while White MSM made up 27% [3, 4] . Although advances in biomedical HIV prevention have led to novel strategies for preventing HIV, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), emerging evidence suggests that PrEP may be reaching some groups of men (e.g., White, gay) more than others (e.g., Black and Latino, bisexual or heterosexual). Furthermore, in public health research, Latinx 2 people are typically treated as a homogenous ethnic group (i.e., race is ignored), and MSM are also treated as a homogenous group in contrast to heterosexual men with limited attention to sexual identities within the MSM category (e.g., gay vs. bisexual). Additionally, research on PrEP use among heterosexual men in the U.S. remains relatively scant [5] , further limiting our understandings of sexual identity differences in PrEP use. As a result, little is known about potential subgroup differences in PrEP use among Latino men. To address this gap in the literature, we examined racial and sexual identity differences in PrEP eligibility and use (including first prescription and second prescription) among Latino men using electronic medical records from a Chicago area healthcare network.",

            "text": "Despite the promise of PrEP for HIV prevention, uptake remains low in the US [6] [7] [8] [9] , especially for Black and Latino MSM. For example, it has been estimated that only 10% of those who might benefit from PrEP have initiated it [10] , and that only 2% of Black and Latinx individuals who could benefit from it filled a prescription in 2015 and 2016 [11] . Of note, these studies treated Latino as a homogenous ethnic group, and emerging evidence suggests that there may be racial differences in HIV and related outcomes among Latino MSM. Specifically, one study found that the prevalence of HIV among Black-Latino young MSM neared that of Black non-Latino young MSM (28% and 31%, respectively), while the prevalence of HIV among White-Latino MSM was similar to that of White non-Latino MSM (5% and 4%, respectively) [12] . These disparities may have been related to differences in sexual partnering, particularly since there was evidence of racial homophily between Latino and non-Latino MSM (e.g. being more likely to partner with someone of a similar racial and/or ethnic background) [12] , but it has also been suggested that racial disparities in the health of Latinx individuals is likely the result of structural inequities (e.g., compared to White-Latinx populations, Black-Latinx populations are more likely to experience unemployment and poverty) [13] . In addition, another study found that, among people living with HIV, Black-Latinx individuals had an increased risk of mortality compared to White-Latinx individuals, even after controlling for individual and neighborhood factors [14] . Together, these findings highlight the importance of attending to both race and ethnicity in order to understand the health of Latino men. To our knowledge, no prior studies have investigated racial differences in PrEP eligibility and use among Latino men.",

However, this practice may obscure important subgroup differences among Latinx people of different races. It is common for researchers to use the two-question format from the U.S. census [16, 17] , where participants are asked one question about their race (without a Latinx option) and a second question about whether they are of Hispanic ethnicity [16, 17] . Typically, the census and health researchers combine the responses of these two questions into a single variable of \"race/ethnicity\" where individuals who are Hispanic are treated as a single category. 3 Researchers who focus on issues of race and ethnicity often view these constructs as overlapping and have differing views on the precise definitions of each [17, 18] . There is a substantial proportion of individuals with Latinx ethnicity who identify as Latinx-only, meaning that they identify exclusively as Latinx and do not identify with Latinx in combination with another racial category [19] ; however, individuals also identify as Latinx in combination with other racial categories such as Latinx and White or Latinx and Black. This highlights the complexity of considering Latinx ethnicity and racial identity within the context of the U.S. In this way, using the two-question approach to consolidate all Latinx individuals into a single category does not align with the lived experiences of many Latinx people.",

For example, compared to gay men, bisexual men are more likely to engage in insertive condomless anal sex (CAS) with casual partners and they are more likely to report substance use before sex [26, 27] . Recent studies have also found that bisexual men are less likely to get tested for HIV/STIs than are gay men, and that they get tested less frequently [25, 27, 28] . In addition, while PrEP uptake remains low among MSM in general [29, 30] , bisexual men are less likely to use PrEP than are gay men [27, 31] . Together, these findings highlight the importance of attending to sexual identity in studies of HIV and related outcomes among MSM. However, our understanding of sexual identity differences in PrEP use remains limited. Specifically, we are not aware of any studies that have examined sexual identity differences in PrEP eligibility based on CDC criteria [32] . This is important, because many US-based studies focus on MSM as a homogenous category or gay men exclusively and very little research examines PrEP use in heterosexual men in the context of the US. While heterosexual men have lower risk for HIV transmission relative to gay and bisexual men, there are still heterosexual men at risk of HIV transmission [24] and PrEP is an effective strategy for prevention among heterosexual men [33] . Very little research about heterosexual men and PrEP use in the U.S. exists outside of studies that focus on intravenous drug use and heterosexual men who have sex with men [5] . Despite this, PrEP is a potentially beneficial intervention for a range of sexual identities including bisexual and heterosexual men.",

This limits our understanding of how PrEP use varies by sexual identity, particularly among bisexual and heterosexual men. Many studies are experiments or observational surveys, which may have biases in regard to the selection of participants. In response to these limitations in the literature, the current study seeks to examine racial and sexual identity differences in PrEP eligibility and use (including first prescription and second prescription) among a sample of cisgender Latino men. By conducting retrospective analyses using EMR from a multisite federally qualified health center (FQHC) in Chicago area we hope to more closely approximate patient behaviors outside of an experimental setting and limit response biases that are present in survey research.",

Research is mixed on whether Latino men may be less likely to disclose same-sex sexual behavior to healthcare providers [39] ; however, some studies suggest that Latino men may be less likely to disclose same-sex sexual behaviors than white men [40] . One possible influence is traditional interpretations of masculinity that are often referred to as \"machismo.\" Machismo and related internalized sexual identity stigma have been linked to reduced sexual identity disclosure among Latino MSM [41] . These traditional masculine norms have also been directly linked to HIV prevention behaviors among Latino MSM such as a lower likelihood of HIV testing [42] as well as lower PrEP awareness, willingness, and adherence [43] . Moreover, Latino MSM also contend with multiple forms of stigma (e.g., related to race, sexual identity, and PrEP use) as well as medical mistrust and discomfort with provider interactions, all of which may contribute to lower odds of PrEP use [44] . Additional research suggests that recent immigration status is also associated with a lower likelihood to disclose relative to individuals born in the U.S. [45, 46] . To our knowledge, it is unknown how comfort with disclosure may vary across racial identities within Latinx communities; however, it is possible that Latinx-only individuals may be less likely to disclose sexual identity or same-sex sexual behavior. Other factors may also be at play in this population such as immigration status, or a stronger identification with culturally-specific traditional gender norms relative to other racial groups within the Latinx diaspora. In regard to PrEP uptake, future analyses may want to consider assessing how the Latinx-only category may differ from other racial categories in regard to access-related variables (e.g., immigration status, insurance status), PrEP-related stigma, as well as variables related to HIV risk and risk-perception. This may also include perceptions of providers as well as targeted messaging. Indeed, in qualitative analyses, Latino MSM expressed the need for culturally appropriate messaging for PrEP advertisements [42] . Future analyses should examine ways to reach all racial subgroups within Latinx populations through appropriate messaging.",

This finding should be understood within the context of CDC PrEP eligibility criteria that are largely risk-based with an emphasis on condomless anal sex between cisgender men [47] . That being said, this analysis suggested that the most frequently used eligibility criteria among heterosexual men were multiple partners and previous STI history, with no heterosexual men meeting the eligibility criteria of condomless sex (vaginal or anal). Indeed, existing literature suggests that heterosexual MSM are less likely to disclose same-sex sexual behavior to medical doctors compared to gay men [45, 48] , which may suggest that these particular risk measures are underreported in these populations. At the same time, heterosexual men were much less frequently deemed eligible without a specific criterion relative to gay and bisexual men. Some research suggests that heterosexual people vulnerable to HIV are among the least likely to be prescribed PrEP by healthcare providers [49] , though it should be noted that this prior research did not disaggregate MSM by sexual identity (e.g. bisexual, gay). Assumptions of relative importance of PrEP prescription by sexual identity may be in part why providers are less likely to assign PrEP eligibility to a heterosexual man without a specific recorded reason, and more likely to deem gay men as eligible without recording a specific reason. Another plausible explanation is that gay men may be more likely to initiate conversations about PrEP with providers as compared to bisexual or heterosexual men.",

This difference represents a lost opportunity to prevent potential HIV transmission in these patients. There is a dearth of research on PrEP in heterosexual men in the context of the United States. Heterosexual men are among the least likely populations to be presented to healthcare providers as potential PrEP candidates in PrEP-related training curriculum across all regions of the U.S. [50] . This trend may impact the degree to which healthcare providers perceive heterosexual men as candidates for PrEP despite there being PrEP eligibility criteria that are relevant to heterosexual men (e.g. having a partner living with HIV, being diagnosed with an STI, having condomless sex, sharing needles, and participating in sex work). While heterosexual men may be less likely to acquire HIV more broadly, heterosexual men who are at risk of HIV transmission should be taken seriously as PrEP candidates. Some of the aforementioned psycho-social variables may also be at play among heterosexual Latino men who are eligible for PrEP, such as intersecting forms of stigma (HIV stigma, sexual identity stigma, and racism) as well as adherence to culturally-specific traditional gender norms. Few studies of heterosexual men examine PrEP outcomes across the PrEP continuum or using longitudinal data [51] . More research is needed to understand why PrEP-eligible heterosexual Latino men are less likely to initiate a PrEP regimen. Researchers may also need to examine targeted communication strategies for PrEP-eligible heterosexual men [52] .",

Gay and bisexual men in this analysis shared the same top 5 eligibility criteria, though bisexual men appeared to have higher frequency of participation in exchange sex in this sample. Yet, bisexual men were less likely to have a first prescription for PrEP as compared to gay men at the one year threshold. This finding is similar to previous literature that suggests that bisexual men are less likely to use PrEP than gay men despite having a unique risk profile (e.g., more likely to use substances before sex, more likely to engage in insertive condomless sex with a casual male partner) [27] . These findings are troubling in that, on average, bisexual men were not less eligible for PrEP than gay men, but were still less likely to get an initial PrEP prescription. It should be noted that this effect became marginally significant when the threshold for initial PrEP prescription was adjusted to 6 months and non-significant when it was adjusted to 3 months in sensitivity analyses, which raises questions about potential explanations. Possible speculative explanations may include time-varying characteristics like partner gender in that bisexual men who partner with women after having previously being screened eligible for PrEP may experience a waning perceived importance of PrEP. Bisexual men may also experience a higher degree of fluctuation in healthcare access overtime, as some research suggests that bisexual populations experience a greater degree of unemployment and uninsured status relative to their heterosexual and gay peers [53] .",

There are a number of possible factors contributing to potential barriers at the provider level. While one study examined representations of sexual identity in clinician training on PrEP, bisexuality was subsumed under a broader MSM category [50] . It is possible that the unique behavioral or clinical presentations of bisexual individuals are incorporated in clinician training. Moreover, there are currently no evidence-based HIV prevention interventions that are tailored to bisexual men [54] and that existing interventions focus on anal sex with male partners which may alienate bisexual men who have female and non-binary partners [55] . There is also a need for bisexual-affirming messaging in PrEP campaigns to better reach bisexual men who may not see themselves reflected in advertisements that are depicting gay men or same-sex male relationships [20] . While there are possible factors at play among providers, bisexual men may also face a range of unique obstacles to PrEP care such as unique forms of stigma, lower perceived HIV risk, lower perceived need for PrEP or barriers to access.",

Stigma in intimate relationships with women may also be at play such that female partners may stigmatize bisexual men's identity which could feasibly contribute to hesitancy to use PrEP, especially if PrEP seen as a medication linked to same-sex attraction. This may be exacerbated by the fact that daily oral forms of PrEP can be difficult to conceal in certain contexts, particularly if a couple is cohabitating. Bisexual populations may also have reduced access to healthcare overall, and a higher likelihood to delay healthcare visits [56] and face lower rates of insurance access relative to gay patients [57] . Bisexual men are also less likely to disclose same-sex sexual behavior to medical doctors compared to gay men [45, 48] , so same-sex sexual risk indicators may be under reported among bisexual men, which may impact eligibility assessments and communication about PrEP.",

Moreover, by employing the \"Bi Us, For Us\" model [33] and partnering with bisexual health advocates and a large healthcare network, the findings were immediately delivered to community partners allowing for immediate impact. Some limitations should be noted. The sample was confined to one health system in Chicago, limiting generalizability. As this dataset is from an EMR, results reflect actual clinical practices, which speaks to the study's ability to present clinical reality. Use of EMR can reduce some biases found in survey research such as recall bias, social desirability bias, and Hawthorne Effects (i.e. changes in behaviors due to a participants' knowledge of being studied) [58] . That being said, EMR like all forms of data presents its own biases. For example, EMR data has less precise/uniform protocols for data collection. Clinical practices often allow for individual clinical judgement in addition to standard screening procedures. This means that there may have been bias introduced into the data based on individual medical providers' clinical judgements. Providers may also have varying approaches to data collection with less regulation than in a controlled research environment. Data in EMR includes predominantly healthcare seeking individuals, which may miss healthier or medicine-adverse individuals. This analysis focused on initial appointments where patients were screened for PrEP eligibility. Future analyses should include longitudinal analytic techniques including assessment of PrEP eligibility at multiple time points. Much of the PrEP research examines PrEP use through self-report and some survey research differentiates stages of PrEP use (e.g. initiation, adherence, discontinuation). In the present study using electronic medical records we were only able to examine PrEP prescriptions, but were not able to examine prescription fills or use of the prescribed pills. Reasons for not pursing a second prescription were not collected in the EMR data, so we were unable to discern reasons that participants did not purse their second prescription. Moreover, we set up time frames between identification of PrEP eligibility and first prescription as well as between first prescription and second prescription. These were based on the average time to PrEP initiation from the literature [36, 37] and based on the number of pills prescribed relative to the days between prescriptions. Additionally, some relevant variables were not available in the current dataset such as immigration status or family's national origins. These additional variables would be informative, especially for characterizing the Latino-only category.",
