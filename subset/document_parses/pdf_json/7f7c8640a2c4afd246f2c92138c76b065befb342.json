The actual syndrome and its link to the administration of blood products did not occur until 1983. In a case series of 3130 consecutive blood transfusions, five patients developed respiratory distress in close association to the transfusion [2] . The lung injury was linked to the transfusion with term TRALI being used. TRALI occurs in both women and men and occurs in patients of any age, except neonates. The reason for the concern with TRALI is the significant morbidity and mortality. Survival from TRALI is estimated at 50%. All plasma-containing blood and blood components have been implicated in the development of TRALI. A common theme to the cases of TRALI is the receipt of blood products 6 hours prior to the development of pulmonary symptoms. Other symptoms that also may occur include fever and hypotension.",

The inflammatory proteins that are elevated in patients with TRALI include interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 as well as protein C-reactive protein. The second hit comes from the antibodies in the transfused blood products. In the two-hit model, a certain threshold from the initial insult must be present in a patient who receives a sufficient amount of volume and titer of antibody. If the amount of antibody is insufficient to initiate antibody-antigen activation, TRALI will not occur.

Antibodies to leukocyte antigen Class I or II or neutrophil antigen can be detected in the transfused blood of patients who develop TRALI. These antibodies in the donor product activate neutrophils in the recipient lung causing pulmonary damage and capillary leak. Donors have developed these antibodies when the immune system comes into contact with foreign HNA or HLA during pregnancy, transfusion, or transplantation [7] .",

Multiparous women have a high exposure to fetal HLA antigens and other granulocyte-borne antigens from the fetus. This knowledge has led to the practice of eliminating donor plasma from multiparous women or the screening of female donors for HLA antibodies. This practice was instituted in 2004. Prior to this change, the estimated incidence of TRALI was 1 in 5000 blood and blood components, 1 in 2000 plasmacontaining components, 1 in 7900 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 in 432 units of whole blood-derived platelets [8] . Since the introduction of male-predominant plasma, the incidence of TRALI has decreased. The University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston evaluated the incidence of TRALI as this center uses plasma in the setting of trauma, and the use is early and aggressive [9] . Over a 10-year period, a total of 714,757 units of blood products were transfused with seven cases of TRALI, giving an incidence of 1 in 102,000. As compared to the screening and discarding of blood based on the presence of antibodies, another approach is the use of pooled solvent-detergent-treated plasma instead of fresh frozen plasma. This treatment with solvent and detergent was done to inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses. This approach has been shown to be effective in eliminating the antibodies [10] .",

Also, these patients should not be treated with diuretics as fluid overload is not the precipitating factor. TRALI may be differentiated from transfusion-associated circulatory overload by obtaining a B-type natriuretic peptide level, which is elevated in overload. Other factors that differentiate TRALI from transfusion-associated circulatory overload include the elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and the positive response to diuretics in overload.

This point highlights the general consensus that TACO is vastly underreported and lacks a clear, established defining set of criteria, as evidenced by the variation in the reported incidence among studies with active surveillance. Data from the Serious Hazards of Transfusion UK reporting system suggest [13] . TACO was more likely to occur with the transfusion of packed red blood cells (1/8000), as compared to plasma (1/15,000) or platelets (1/48,000) [14] .

In the normal lung, fluid that is filtered out of circulation into the alveolar interstitial space does not enter the alveoli due to tight junctions that prevent passage; this fluid is removed via the lymphatics. The hydrostatic force for fluid filtration between the capillaries and alveoli microcirculation is roughly equal, with the osmotic pressure of the capillaries tipping the balance slightly in favor of capillary circulation [14] . In TACO, the hydrostatic pressure increases due to the rapid increase in circulatory volume resulting in an imbalance. There is an increase in fluid filtration (edema into the interstitial space), and the tight junctions of the epithelium are overcome allowing protein poor fluid to enter the alveolar space thus causing pulmonary edema.",

            "text": "There are multiple risk factors for TACO, with age, cardiovascular dysfunction, and renal disease being the major risk factors. Although TACO can occur at any age, advanced age appears to be the greatest risk with most studies reporting the highest incidence in patients aged greater than 70 years. Patients with cardiovascular dysfunction also have a higher incidence of TACO. In particular, patients with CHF (especially NYHA Class 4), atrial fibrillation, a history of coronary artery disease, use of diuretics (and lack of use when there is evidence of TACO), and amiodarone all have a higher risk of developing TACO [16] . Chronic renal failure has also been shown to be a risk factor. Other risk factors include positive fluid status (fluids other than blood products can contribute to TACO), number of units transfused, type of product transfused (likely related to volume), rate of transfusion, preexisting pulmonary disease, female sex (although the evidence is not conclusive), patients of small stature, shock, anemia, and hospitalized patients (especially OR and ICU) [12, 14, 15] . Many of the risk factors lend credence to the hypothesis that TACO occurs when the body's ability to manage intravascular volume status is overwhelmed, especially when intravascular volume is increased by a large amount or at higher infusion rates. For example, the incidence of TACO correlates with the number of units of blood products transfused, and there is evidence that higher rates of infusion lead to higher incidence of TACO [12, 18] . Respiratory distress/worsening pulmonary status within 6 hours of receiving a blood transfusion is the principle manifestation of TACO. A patient's respirations, oxygen saturation, heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, and fluid balance should all be monitored closely during transfusion. Increasing oxygen requirement and decreasing oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry should warrant further investigation including a chest x-ray and physical exam. Consideration should be given to close monitoring for 24 hours after transfusion as multiple studies show clear evidence that active surveillance yields higher rates of recognition of TACO. Supplemental oxygen which is common in the OR and ICU can mask evidence for worsening pulmonary status, especially if the patient is intubated. Arterial blood gas monitoring measures the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) which is used in ARDS and TRAILI and could prove useful in TACO.

Supplemental oxygen may be delivered via nasal canula; however, positive pressure may be required if the pulmonary edema is severe; BiPap or high flow nasal canula can be useful. Diuretic use has shown a significant decrease in not only the incidence of TACO but also the mortality when it occurs. In cases of severe renal failure, CRRT or hemodialysis is used to reduce volume overload. Reduction of afterload as tolerated by the patient may also prove useful in decreasing workload and increasing cardiac output.

He termed the first pattern A and the second pattern B. There were other individuals who did not achieve any pattern of agglutination, which was termed C. The first two patterns led to the nomenclature of Type A and Type B; it was the lack of a pattern of agglutination that led to Type O. Furthermore, it was these observations that led Dr. Landsteiner to postulate that whichever ABO antigens are lacking on a red blood cell will result in the corresponding antibody. This theory has been termed Landsteiner's Law. The antigens for the ABO system are produced by various enzymes that add sugars to the oligosaccharide chain. The source of the antibodies is less clear; it may due to inherited antibodies or due to classical immune-mediated reactions. When ABO incompatible blood is administered, hemolysis may occur.",

The most common blood product to produce a non-hemolytic transfusion reaction is platelets. Initially, it was felt that the reaction was due to the presence of white blood cells in the patient's plasma that reacted with the white cells in the blood product. This explanation mainly applies to red blood cells; platelets have a different explanation. The reaction is more likely to occur the older the platelets are. Within the stored platelets, there is the generation of cytokines during storage. These cytokines are responsible for the reaction [22] .

When the IgM antibody binds to the antigen, the red cell membrane is destroyed resulting in the release of contents within the red blood cell into the circulation. The free hemoglobin damages the kidney, while the complement activation leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation [24] . Management includes stopping the transfusion and administering fluids, vasopressors, and blood products for the coagulopathy.

This incidence is due to storage as platelets are stored at room temperature, allowing bacteria to grow that would otherwise remain dormant at lower levels with refrigeration. In countries where platelets are screened using BacT/ALERT culture system, the incidence of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections is lower [31] . The detection of bacterial contamination in platelet samples is largely dependent on bacterial concentration as tests where resampling of a previously positive BacT/ALERT screenings has yielded negative results [32] . Unlike viruses, bacteria have the ability to multiply during storage making the duration of their storage another factor in the incidence of transfusion-related bacterial infection. One study found that the incidence of contamination and the bacterial levels measured were both significantly less for units transfused in under 4 days compared with units that were 5 days and older [33] .",
