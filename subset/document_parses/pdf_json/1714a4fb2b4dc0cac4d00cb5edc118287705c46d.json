            "text": "HGPS is an extremely rare but incurable genetic disease exhibiting rapid aging of multiple organs, ultimately leading to early death (patients die at teens or early 20s). Most HGPS patients exhibit a single base mutation in the lamin A (LMNA) gene from cytosine (C) to a thymine (T) (1824C > T) (Fig. 1a) . This mutation leads to mis-splicing during LMNA transcription and subsequently translates into a truncated lamin A protein, termed progerin ( Fig. 1a) , in which progerin protein always keeps tagging with a farnesyl group. The accumulation of farnesylated progerin is toxic for nuclear shape and rigidity, which hampers nucleus function resulting in HGPS disease. Attempts to discover treatments for progeria initially focused on trying to reduce the accumulation of farnesylated progerin. Although small-molecule inhibitors for farnesyltransferase have been screened and tested to provide treatment options for patients, the treatment with them only partially alleviates the disease symptoms in clinics. Beyret et al. and Santiago-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. have used CRISPR-Cas9mediated lamin A/progerin reduction by disrupting activity of HGPS-mutated gene. But their health reverted only several alterations in HGPS cells and mice. To make the matter worse, these treatment strategies also lead to frameshift mutations in the LMNA gene, which could disable a human's copy of the gene to adequately correct the disease due to this harmful effect. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new strategy to directly repair the mutation that causes HGPS.",

            "text": "Correcting the mutation in HGPS mouse models provides a potential utility of ABE as a possible therapeutic approach to cure human HGPS. However, are ABE-treated cells safe in humans? One of the safety concerns is the control of undesired genome editing outcomes, because excessive, prolonged expression of an active ABE system could increase the off-target effect. Cas-independent off-target DNA editing by ABE7.10 has been reported to be minimal or undetectable. 2 To assess off-target editing by ABEmax-VRQR, Koblan et al. performed CIRCLE-seq on genomic DNA and next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on RNA isolated from ABE-lentivirus-treated HGPS patient cells, suggesting a minimal degree of off-target DNA or RNA editing and undetectable for the top 32 candidate off-target loci for the selected sgRNA. 1 An important question is that therapeutic editing requires effective and targeted delivery methods in human HGPS patients. Koblan et al. used the AAV, a delivery modality that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to express the base editor. 1 The authors chose the AAV9 capsid for its broad tissue tropism, clinical validation, and ability to transduce into progeriainflicted cells. However, AAV gene therapy may have the potential for genotoxic integration events. A long-term study of AAV8 or AAV9 gene therapy reveals that 1741 unique integration events were observed in genomic DNA, which clonal expansion of cells is associated with cancer in humans. 5 Therefore, it is necessary to further assess the safety of AAV gene therapy in humans. To our knowledge, both lipid nanoparticles (LNP) and electroporation (EP) delivery methods encapsulate modified mRNA or DNA molecules of ABEmax-VRQR and its sgRNAs could be as alternative strategies instead of the AAV delivery method due to the recent success in the fastest development of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 using LNP in our lifetime. In addition, the delivery efficiency and specificity of gene editing for the pathogenic human LMNA c.1824 C > T allele need to be tested in clinical application, which is challenging and often involves years of try and error practice. Moreover, what is the optimal distribution of ABEmax-VRQR, and which organs can be targeted by distinct delivery methods (AAV, LNP, EP or others)? Although in vivo delivery for therapies remains many challenges, we anticipate that further testing could determine the suitable delivery for gene therapy to control diseases and improve human health.",

Cas9-induced immune responses have been reported in general human populations. Therefore, a response may lead to non-active treatment if cells containing the components of ABEmax-VRQR, such as Cas9, were selectively eliminated. However, a long-term clinical study showed that the minimal levels of Cas9 (<0.75 fg per cell) did not activate strong Cas9-specific humoral immunity, providing a hope for the treatment dose of ABEmax-VRQR for no immunogenic administration in clinical applications. Furthermore, using immune-orthogonal orthologues of Cas9, discovering new CRISPR-Cas enzymes, or engineering Cas9 protein with mapping and editing epitopes for a better immunological profile, might circumvent immune response in humans. In addition, AAVmediated CRISPR therapeutics also face the same safety concern, such as existing humoral and cellular immunity against AAV capsid. Therefore, it remains to be investigated whether delivering ABEmax-VRQR into the human body will compromise safety or therapeutic efficacy. Overall, focusing on the clinically validated long-term safety of ABE-AAV and its-edited cells in humans will contribute to the way for next-generation gene therapies.",

These findings suggest a potential future functional base editing treatment for human HGPS and possibly other genetic disorders.",
