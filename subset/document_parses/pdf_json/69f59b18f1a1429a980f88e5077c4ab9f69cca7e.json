Factory and transport workers were being encouraged to return to work, and hence were put at risk, while most middle-class jobs could far more readily still be done from home. The rules on child care and social care were unclear, and personal protective equipment was in short supply for both, re-enforcing these injustices (BBC Radio 4, 'Today', 12 May, 2020). The Black Lives Matter movement, a mass mobilisation which followed the killing of George Floyd by a white policeman in Minneapolis, USA, quickly led to large demonstrations and marches for the same cause in the UK.",

He was denounced as an inquisitor as well as a persecutor of the poor.

As a result, the total sum of consumption plus investment could fall short of the levels required to supply jobs for all, especially if the rate of profit declined.

The de-industrialisation which began in the mid-1960s, as multinational companies began to relocate production in the Far East (and from North to South and Central America), left workers needing to adapt to a new employment landscape, in which educational qualifications and technical skills were at a premium. Those who lacked these were often left with low-paid, insecure, part-time employment or self-employment; more women had entered the labour market, but mainly as secondary contributors to household incomes.",

As had happened in previous demonstrations, the police perceived peaceful demonstrations as 'unruly' and potentially violent, and attempted to disperse them, enabling the militants looking for a fight to hit back in 'self-defence' (BBC Radio 4, 'How Peaceful Protests Turn into Riots', 'The Life Scientific' (presented by Jim Al-Khalili), 16 June, 2020).",

It caused massive lay-offs and declines in incomes, but it also gave rise to the furlough payments which offered a glimpse of a possible future. If wages would need subsidisation on an even larger scale than before the pandemic, perhaps this could be done according to a principle more consistent with class solidarity. This will be the topic of the next chapter. ",
