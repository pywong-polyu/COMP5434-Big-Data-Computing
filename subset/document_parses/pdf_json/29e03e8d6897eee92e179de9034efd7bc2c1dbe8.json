However, some bovine antibodies have ultralong CDRs comprising more than 50 residues organized in a stalk and a disulfide-rich knob. The design features of this structural unit and its influence on antibody stability remained enigmatic. Here, we show that the stalk length is critical for the folding and stability of antibodies with an ultra-long CDR and that the disulfide bonds in the knob do not contribute to stability; they are important for organizing the antigen-binding knob structure. The bovine ultra-long CDR can be integrated into human antibody scaffolds. Furthermore, mini-domains from de novo design can be reformatted as ultra-long CDRs to create unique antibody-based proteins neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha variant of concern with high efficiency. Our findings reveal basic design principles of antibody structure and open new avenues for protein engineering.",

All four chains are covalently connected by disulfide bonds into a characteristic Y-shaped structure. The antigen-binding site is formed by segments in the variable domains of both the heavy (V H ) and the light chains (V L ), the so-called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). These are loops connecting \u03b2-strands. V H and V L contribute three CDRs each: CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3 for the HC, and CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3 for the LC. In humans, the CDR sequences are rather short and even CDR-H3, which shows the largest variability in length, is typically composed of only 6 to 20 amino acids 2, 3 . Longer human CDR-H3s consisting of 25 to 30 residues are also known but they are much less prevalent in comparison to their shorter counterparts 4, 5 . As a result of the CDR length, the common human antibodies usually have a large but flat antigen-binding surface that is not suitable for the recognition of some antigens, for example, certain viruses 3, 6 .",

However, despite the structural diversity, antibodies from all species mentioned above have CDRs of a similar average length as the human CDRs 2, 3, 8, 9 . Therefore, it came as a surprise that the CDR-H3s of some bovine antibodies can be extremely expanded 10, 11 . These bovine antibodies have the longest naturally occurring CDR sequences known to date. They can consist of 50 to 70 amino acids 12 . Interestingly, the ultra-long CDRs are made of two distinct structuresa \u03b2-ribbon \"stalk\" which protrudes from the HC and a \"knob\" that sits atop of the \"stalk\", giving the entire CDR-H3 a characteristic mushroom shape 13 . The stalk is formed by the sequences at the beginning and at the end of the CDR-H3 insert. What makes this structure even more fascinating is the presence of several disulfide bonds in the \"knob\". The above-mentioned features make bovine antibodies with ultra-long CDR-H3 unique binders for antigen epitopes that are less accessible to antibodies from other species 13, 14 . This has been demonstrated by immunization of cows with a surface protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), an HIV-1 Env trimer, and the subsequent isolation of a bovine antibody (NC-Cow1) with broadly neutralizing activity against HIV 15 . Like some other bovine antibodies 13, 16, 17 , NC-Cow1 has an ultra-long CDR-H3 (60 residues) divided into a stalk and a knob (Fig. 1a, b) . The crystal structure of NC-Cow1 bound to its antigen revealed that antigen recognition occurs via the knob 18 . However, the importance of the different structural elements in the ultra-long CDR-H3 for the folding, stability and binding affinity of bovine antibodies remained enigmatic.",

The mutant with deleted stalk could not be modeled due to severe steric clashes between the knob and the Fv framework when the stalk was removed, which corresponds to the lower stability and antigen-binding affinity of the \u0394stalk mutant compared to wt. MD simulations on the G-stalk mutant indicate that replacing the stalk with Gly residues strongly increases the motion of the knob relative to the Fv framework (magenta lines in Fig. 1h and i) ; however, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the knob itself with respect to the start knob structure is remarkably similar between wt and G-stalk (orange lines in Fig. 1h, i) . Hence, the knob retains its rigidity when the stalk is highly flexible, which explains the preserved antigen binding by the G-stalk mutant. The RMSD of the core part of the G-stalk (blue lines in Fig. 1h and i) is on average slightly larger (<RMSD>~2.2 \u00c5) than the corresponding mean deviation for the wt (<RMSD>~1.5 \u00c5).

We were interested whether this naturally-occurring stalk could be extended by replicating the rigid \u03b2-ribbon structure. We therefore repeated these complementary residues to obtain mutants with a double and a triple stalk, named (stalk) 2 and (stalk) 3, respectively ( Supplementary  Fig. 2a) . We observed that extending the stalk in this way reduced the secretion levels of the corresponding Fab fragments from mammalian cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b ). The secondary structures of the purified variants remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 2c ), but the thermal stability of the Fabs with longer stalks was lower compared to the wt (Table 1 and Supplementary  Fig. 2d ).

One could presume that such long CDRs are avoided by evolution because they could impose constraints on folding and stability. However, despite the complexity of its CDR-H3, the NC-Cow1 Fab was well secreted (Fig. 1c ) and thermally stable (Fig. 1f) . This raises the question whether the framework in these bovine antibodies has exceptional stability that can compensate for potential destabilization induced by the ultra-long CDR-H3. To test this hypothesis, we replaced the ultra-long CDR-H3 in NC-Cow1 with short bovine CDR-H3 loops from the bovine antibodies BS1, BS2, B4 and B13 (Supplementary Fig. 3a) 13, 19 . However, in contrast to our assumption, the mutants with short bovine CDR-H3s were secreted poorly compared to the NC-Cow1 wt ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ). In line with the potential folding problems in the cell, the grafted variants with short bovine CDR-H3s affected the secondary structure of the Fabs (Supplementary Fig. 3c ) and reduced their thermal stabilities (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3d ). We wondered whether the high stability is a specific feature of the cow Fabs with ultra-long CDRs and therefore also characterized bovine Fabs which naturally contain short CDR-H3s, namely B4 and B13. We found that they formed heterodimers ( Supplementary Fig. 3e ), had the characteristic secondary structures ( Supplementary  Fig. 3f) , and high thermal stability ( Supplementary Fig. 3g) .",

In addition, we created a mutant, C(I-V)S, where all six cysteines in the knob were replaced by serine residues. All C \u2192 S mutants were secreted at levels comparable to those of the NC-Cow1 wt Fab in mammalian cells (Fig. 2b) and exhibited similar CD spectra (Fig. 2c) ; remarkably, however, all mutants had lost their antigen-binding properties (Fig. 2d) . The question remaining was whether the disulfide bond deletions in the knob affect the overall stability of NC-Cow1 Fab. Preliminary experiments monitoring the thermal stability of the C \u2192 S mutants by FUV CD spectroscopy revealed transitions similar to those observed for NC-Cow1 wt ( Supplementary  Fig. 4a ). To determine whether there are subtle changes in the thermal unfolding that were not detected by FUV CD, we used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). NC-Cow1 wt Fab exhibited one unfolding peak in the thermogram with a T M of 69.4\u00b0C (Fig. 2e ) that corresponds well to the observed transition in FUV CD (Fig. 1f ). The mutants with pairwise C \u2192 S substitutions also showed only one unfolding transition and had only slightly lower T M values ( Fig. 2e and Table 1 ). Noteworthy, even the C(I-V)S mutant that cannot form any disulfide bonds in the knob exhibits a thermal stability very similar to the NC-Cow1 wt with a T M of 67.1\u00b0C.",

Comparative MD simulations on the Fv of the NC-Cow1 wt and the cysteine variants indicate that the framework is not affected as no deviation (RMSD) was observed when disulfide bonds are removed from the knob (Fig. 2g ). This result is in line with the observed small effect of the disulfide bond removal on protein stability. Also, the overall motion of framework plus knob is only modestly increased upon disulfide bond removal (Fig. 2h) . However, the RMSD of the knob itself increased significantly over time already upon the removal of one disulfide and even larger deviations relative to the starting structure were observed when removing all disulfide bonds (Fig. 2i) . These structural changes in the knob of the ultra-long CDR-H3 in the absence of disulfide bonds explains the experimentally observed loss of antigen binding of these variants.",

It had previously been shown that the knob in bovine antibodies with ultra-long CDR-H3 can be replaced by short peptides 20,21 or small cytokines 22, 23 to create functional fusion proteins. Since the NC-Cow1 Fab remained stable after we removed all disulfide bonds in the knob, we wondered whether the structure would tolerate the replacement of the knob with non-bovine long CDRs. In fact, there are several human antibodies that have a long CDR-H3 that folds into a hammerhead structure (e.g. the PG16 antibody) 24 or contains a beta strand (e.g. the VRC26.25 antibody) 25 that are important for binding to the antigen. The CDR-H3 of PG16 does not contain cysteines, while the CDR-H3 of VRC26.25 has one disulfide bond. We were therefore interested if the grafting of these two different human CDR structures will affect the stability of NC-Cow1. Moreover, we wanted to test whether the grafted human CDR-H3 will still exhibit binding to the antigen. We therefore grafted sequences from the CDR-H3 of PG16 and VRC26.25 in the place of the knob in NC-Cow1 to create the wt\u2192PG16 and wt\u2192VRC26.25 mutants (Supplementary Fig. 5a ). These NC-Cow1 Fab mutants were well secreted ( Supplementary Fig. 5b ) and had wildtype-like secondary structure ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ). The thermal stability of the mutants with replaced knobs was only slightly lower (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 5d ); wt\u2192PG16 has a T M of 65.3\u00b0C, the T M of wt\u2192VRC26.25 is 67.9\u00b0C. Like the C \u2192 S mutants in the previous section, wt\u2192PG16 and wt\u2192VRC26.25 showed differences in the peak shape and elution time in SEC MALS ( Supplementary  Fig. 5e ) and did not bind to the antigen ( Supplementary Fig. 5f ).",

This suggests that in both trastuzumab+knob and NC-Cow1 \u0394stalk, the knob is located close to the V H framework, which has negative effects on antigen binding. The 32H+109L + knob and PGT145 + knob had K D s of 6.5 nM and 7.7 nM, respectively (Table 1) ; the CDR-H3s of these two human Fabs are longer which positions the inserted knob further away from the V H framework in comparison to trastuzumab. In addition to the SPR measurements, we tested whether the human Fabs with grafted bovine knobs bind to the soluble HIV Env trimer ( Supplementary  Fig. 8c ). All three Fabs bound the trimeric HIV Env as seen by the molecular weight shift in SEC-MALS. It turned out that 32H +109L + knob and PGT145 + knob are better binders than trastuzumab + knob which supports our SPR data.

We hypothesized that we could use these helices in the context of an ultra-long CDR-H3. To test this, we inserted the sequence encoding the two helices into the CDR-H3 of three human and one bovine Fab fragment (Fig. 4a) . All four Fab fragments with the LCB1 insertion were correctly folded ( Supplementary Fig. 11a ) and bound with sub-nanomolar affinity to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4b, c and Supplementary Fig. 11b) . Remarkably, the Fab-LCB1s formed complexes with molecular masses corresponding to that of two Fab fragments (Fig. 4d) .

In agreement with this notion, NC-Cow1 exhibited an intrinsic stability similar to two bovine antibodies with short CDR-H3s. Surprisingly, the replacement of the ultra-long bovine CDR-H3 with a short bovine CDR-H3s negatively affected the in vivo folding and stability of NC-Cow1. A likely explanation is that the ultra-long CDR-H3 exhibits stabilizing interactions with the other CDRs in the V H and V L domains. Potentially stabilizing interactions between the stalk and the other CDRs can be seen in the crystal structure of NC-Cow1 18 (Fig. 5b) and other bovine antibodies 13, 16, 17 . The negative consequences of replacing stalk residues by glycines fits the picture. In this case, the MD simulations indicate a strongly enhanced mobility of the knob relative to the framework but little effect on the knob structure itself. This reveals that the relative geometrical arrangement of the knob and framework affect stability but are not critical for antigen binding. For engineering antibodies with ultra-long CDRs, the specific interactions between amino acids in the stalk and other CDRs are an important aspect to consider. In this context, it would be important to establish screening technologies for antibodies with ultra-long CDR-H3s. The fact that the conformational restraints by disulfide bonds in the knob are crucial for antigen binding of NC-Cow1 however presents a challenge for the development of screening libraries using phage, yeast or mammalian display libraries (Fig. 5c) 35 . Recent work has demonstrated that disulfiderich peptides can in principle be isolated using mammalian display screening. However, correct folding on the cell surface remains a challenge 33 .",

In this study, we identified a human scaffold (32H+109L) which is an excellent receptor for the grafting of the CDRs from NC-Cow1. The chimera did not impact folding in vivo, but a reduction in thermal stability was observed pointing to additional stabilizing interactions between the CDRs and framework in the authentic context which are not present in the chimera. It is also possible that the relative orientation of the grafted bovine CDRs is not maintained upon grafting, which might explain the reduced thermal stability. Additional mutations in the Vernier zone of the antibody framework could be a feasible approach to solve this issue 37 . We also show that this problem can be circumvented by knob grafting (Fig. 6 ). This strategy is less invasive with the best results obtained for a bovine knob grafted on the tip of a long human CDR-H3; in line with our notion that a stalk is required to isolate the knob from the V H domain.

Such approaches could quickly identify knobs against antigens of concern. Ideally, the knobs will be isolated by in vitro display or in silico techniques like de novo design. We believe that knobs can be easily grafted on bovine and human antibody scaffolds that have a stalk with optimal length. We demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach by reformatting LCB1 34 , a de novo designed mini-domain against SARS-CoV-2 and used it as an ultra-long CDR-H3 in different Fabs (Fig. 6) . The inserted mini-domain retained its high binding affinity for the RBD. Virus neutralization assays showed high neutralization efficiency not only for a SARS-CoV-2 strain that was isolated early in the pandemic, but also for the prevalent SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant. A unique feature observed was the dimerization of LCB1 in the Fab context. As dimerization of Fabs improves their half-lives and reduces clearance 38 , our approach could allow the generation of antibody-based therapeutics with enhanced half-life but without Fc-effector functions. The strategy to insert de novo designed antigen-binding peptides as ultra-long CDRs will offer An optimal stalk length in the ultra-long CDR-H3 ensures proper folding without steric clashes between the knob and residues in the variable domains. b There is a consensus between the stalk of CDR-H3 with some of the other CDRs. Depicted are part of the variable domains of NC-Cow1 (PDB:6OO0). The bovine stalk in CDR-H3 is in red, the remaining of the V H domain is in green, the V L domain is in gray. The black lines illustrate a network of potential contacts between the residues in the stalk and some of the other CDRs. c The disulfide bonds (yellow lines) in the ultra-long CDR-H3 (blue) provide conformational restraints crucial for binding to the antigen (magenta).",
