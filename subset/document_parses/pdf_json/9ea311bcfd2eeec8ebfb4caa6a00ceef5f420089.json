The model uses a low number of input parameters and stochastic distributions. It is expected that this will provide the model with the required robustness to accurately predict demand on services. In particular, the model has been used to predict deceases, but it can be easily modified to predict the demand of ICUs or mechanical ventilators under different restraint policies. To achieve this goal, the model implements the following four key characteristics: For the previous reasons, the mathematical structure of the proposed model, a Carriers-Infections-Recoveries (CIR) model, departs significantly from the one of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model.",

Here, 'stopping being contagious' means to reach immunity or death, which in both cases produces a barrier to propagation. According to the discussion in Appendix B, I suppose that there are two groups of contagious individuals: mild (type 1) and serious (type 2).

However, there is no estimation for , , and 2 . In addition, the date of the first infection is also an unknown (Appendix B gives a plausible range). To solve this problem, an optimization process was launched to minimize the difference between the calculated data and the real one (in a logarithmic scale) for three starting points: beginning with a far date (scenario 1) and ending with a close date (scenario 3). The values of the parameters , , and 2 which minimizes the error for each scenario are collected in Table 1 . In all scenarios, the restriction of movements imposed by the government has been taken into account by a tenfold reduction of , that is, the value of before the day of confinement (March 15 th , one day after its official publication) is the one given in Table 1 and it is /10 after such day. The errors reached in the three scenarios are almost identical, showing that this error cannot be used to fit the date of the first infection. Indeed, the values of 2 and and this date are strongly correlated, fixing one of them significantly fixes the others. The closer the date of the infection, the larger the value of 2 . For example, the assumption of March 16 th as the initial date leads to 2 > 1, which is not possible, and hence this date must be discarded.",

            "text": "Results show, as expected, that the susceptible population to be exposed is not all the population of Spain. This means that there are regions of Spain (towns, small cities, etc.) which are not accessible to the contagion. Even in cities like Madrid and Barcelona there could be isolated areas with a negligible exposition to the contagion. Obviously the longer the time available for viral spreading, the greater the exposed population. This explains the differences in Table 1 . Discovering empirically which scenario is the real one would require conducting tests over a significant part of the population. Without this information we can only make a conjecture about the most plausible scenario. This conjecture comes from comparing the value of 2 (note that and are very similar). In effect, 2 changes two orders of magnitude following the change of the susceptible population from 13 to 0.13 million. The risk fraction of 0.00342 is very far away from the values 0.143 and 0.5 estimated as upper bounds in Appendix B whereas the risk factor of 0.369 is in such range. The conclusion is that scenario 3 is more plausible than 1 and that the initial date will probably be between January 31 st and February 5 th . Assuming, 2 = 0.167, the minimization of the error leads to February 3 rd , = 0.2833 million, = 0.550, = 2.95, (\u221e) = 0.2811 million and (\u221e) = 13280. The solution of the differential equations for this set of input parameters is shown in figure 1 , where the matching is significantly good. Note that the real active cases for mild and serious cases has not been used to fit any parameter since their definitions are not clear (are the infected who stay at home counted as mild cases?) and probably does not coincides with the ones given in this article. At the moment of writing this article, the number of active cases in Spain was 80110 [1] whereas the final number calculated for Figure 1 is 281100 but can be much higher if the initial date is moved far away. For this reason, only deaths have been used for fitting purposes: the uncertainty on reported deaths, although not zero, is lower. To illustrate this fact, Figure 2 shows the calculated curves for the case less probable (i.e., scenario 1 in Table 1 ). As can be seen, the matching is as good as the one obtained for the case of figure 1 . However, the difference in the number of final recoveries is huge: 13 million (near 27% of the Spanish population) in the less probable case and 0.2811 million (near 0.6%) in the other case. ",

            "text": "Reference [3] reports that a Spanish woman who was infected on February 29 th began symptoms on March 5th, that is, 5 or 6 days after the infection. She did recover completely on March 12 th , that is, 12 or 13 days after the infection. The CoVid-19 test was positive on March 10 th . She did not transmit the virus to any of her relatives nor to any of the 11 people who she met before knowing she was infected. We can use this case to estimate the parameters for mild infections, that is, for type 1: 1 = 13 = 6.72 days. We can also use this case to estimate the parameter for developing symptoms and entering the medical service: Reference [4] reports that a party held at the end of February in Spain brought together 80 (apparently healthy) people. The result were 14 infections, of whom 7 were hospitalized and 1 was admitted in the ICU. He was admitted in the ICU on March 10th, nearly 12 days after the party, this means that for type 2, = 12 = 6.20 days, which is a result very similar to that obtained previously from reference [3] . It is relevant to remark that this person was healthy, athletic, non-smoking and in his 50s, thus we conclude that all the population is susceptible to be in the type 2; however, only 7 out of 14 were seriously affected and 1 out of 14 was very seriously affected. This sets a rough estimation for the fraction of type 2 infections, 2 = \u22480.5, but note that this number should be taken as a superior limit because there could be non-detected carriers. In addition, it seems plausible that, at that party, there was only one initial carrier of type 1 and hence, the success in the contagion can be estimated as = 13/79 = 16.5%.",

The infected person had mild symptoms and was discharged on February 14 th . The contagion came from a German person who had been diagnosed. This case and many others like the one reported in reference [3] make very plausible the hypothesis of having two types of infection: mild and serious. The first case on the Iberian Peninsula (in Catalonia) was a 36-year-old woman who was confirmed on February 26 th . Supposedly, she was exposed to the virus in the north of Italy (Milan and Bergamo) between the days 12 th and 22 nd of February. Taking into account an incubation period of 6 days, we could have two rough estimations for the initial date: January 25 th and February 23 rd . Almost for sure, there were other infections which were not detected because they laid in the mild-condition group (note that this group includes even those infected who had absence of symptoms) and hence the initial infection could have happened, as a first guess, near February 5 th . This data has great uncertainty and must be the object of further discussion.",
