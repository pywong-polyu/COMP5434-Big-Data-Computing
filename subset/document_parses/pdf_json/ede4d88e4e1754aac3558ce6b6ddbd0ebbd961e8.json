            "text": "The Veterans Affairs (VA) has been at the forefront of harnessing the skills of clinical pharmacy services to improve patient care outcomes and create access for veterans. Since the integration of clinical pharmacy specialists (CPS) into the patient-centered medical home model (PCMH) known within the VA as patient-aligned care team (PACT), literature has continued to show the impact CPS have in primary care when involved in comprehensive medication management (CMM). [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The integration of PACT CPS into primary care in the VA has served to enhance the PCMH. 11, 12 While CPS services expanded and showed benefit in patient care metrics, it became evident there remained a veteran population that was underserved. Clinical pharmacy services were often unavailable in smaller, rural clinics. In recognition of this, CPS services through telemedicine in the VA emerged through adopting both direct-toconsumer (DTC) and facilitated telemedicine modalities to assist in reaching underserved populations. While telephonic care in between face-to-face appointments was already a key component for standard CMM, video telemedicine was an innovative method of delivering healthcare services. The VA is a pioneer in telehealth advancement to reach and improve access for rural veterans. 13, 14 The 2018 \"Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks\" (MISSION) Act was signed in law prior to the COVID19 pandemic and had a goal of all VA providers in mental health and primary care service lines capable and experienced with providing video visits. 14 To address the impending doubt that the quality of care could be maintained through telemedicine modalities with no in-person visits, two observational analyses were conducted at a Tennessee VA medical center. Results illustrated that DTC and facilitated telemedicine visits were just as effective at achieving patient healthcare goals as in-person visits. 15, 16 Evidence continued to surface as outlined by Niznik and colleagues in a meta-analysis of practices with pharmacists providing telemedicine services. Out of the 34 initiatives reviewed, 26 showed a net positive impact and seven showed an overall neutral impact. 17 As telemedicine utilization diffused across healthcare systems, many benefits were widely recognized. One patient satisfaction survey indicated that the majority of patients treated through DTC telemedicine were more or just as satisfied compared to traditional inperson visits. Themes included convenience, quicker appointment times, and an overall positive experience. Only 1.5% of survey participants were less satisfied with telemedicine citing difficulties with technology or personal preference. 18 While the patient population of this survey differs from that of the typical veteran population, the benefits remain applicable. Despite the progressively changing perception and initiatives to catalyze utilization, DTC telemedicine accounted for less than 30% of overall PACT CPS encounters at the Tennessee Valley VA in 2019.",

During each study period, PACT CPS received a constant inflow of new referrals as well as continuing to manage patients established with a CPS prior to the selected study period. New patients were established solely through virtual care during the pandemic. Designated full-time employment (FTE) did not change between study periods. Data points requested focused on clinic encounters, patient accountability to appointments, disease state expansion, and markers of disease-state management. Specific data points collected were: CPS pharmacotherapy clinic patient encounters to include in-person, telephone, VA Video Connect (VVC), which is the VA's method for DTC telemedicine, and Clinical Video Telehealth (CVT) which is the VA's method of facilitated telemedicine; number of unique patients treated during each study period; cancellations and no show rates during each study period; diseases states managed, insulin use, and demographic data including age, race, and gender. Given diabetes and hypertension are the main disease states managed by most PACT CPS', the study evaluated changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and blood pressure (BP) between the two-time cohorts as well. Hemoglobin A1c was measured by the average first and last documented lab and vitals values in the timeframes of each year. Patients were excluded from disease state data analysis if there were not two values documented within the study period. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Software or Microsoft Excel. A Student t test was used for continuous data and Chi-squared or Fishers Exact for nominal data.",

See Table 3 for other diagnoses encountered by CPS in the given timeframes. The average reductions in A1c were 0.57% in the 2019 cohort and 0.58% in the 2020 cohort, P = .94. The average reductions in SBP were 3.1mmHg and 3.2mmHg (P = .968) in 2019 and 2020, respectively, with a reduction in DBP of 1.1 mmHg in 2019 and 2 mmHg in 2020 (P = .3), see Table 4.4 | DISCUSSION COVID19 quickly changed the direct patient care model in 2020. Prior to COVID19, the majority of CPS encounters in PACT at this VA system were face-to-face, and this drastically decreased as expected in 2020. Despite this substantial decrease in face-to-face encounters, there was a 32% increase in total number of visits from 2019 to 2020 and an increase in number of unique patients with a CPS visit. Not only did the number of encounters and percent of virtual care increase, but also the no show and cancellation rates significantly decreased. This shows that in a large VA healthcare system with 24 full time CPS in PACT whose PACT assignment nor hours changed related to COVID, the shift in modality of patient care did not compromise the impact of CPS interventions on patient care. Additionally, the number of video visits into patients' homes increased greater than 200%. This is a significant advancement as it potentially indicates that this primarily elderly veteran population is capable of becoming increasingly comfortable with virtual modalities of care. Furthermore, even with a significant increase in the number of unique patients treated and an increase in number of patient encounters, the quality of care was not decreased. In fact, expansion was seen in disease state management with a greater than 400% rise in encounters for tobacco cessation. Diabetes and hypertension were still the top disease states managed by clinical pharmacists; however, the efficiency of telemedicine undoubtedly abetted the PACT CPS to expand beyond traditional management.

First, the study did not distinguish between new referrals and established patients in these two timeframes. The standard of practice regarding new referrals, management, and discharge of patients who are stable and achieving treatment goals in PACT CPS clinics did not change from 2019 to 2020. Therefore, because the number of unique patients increased from 2019 to 2020, it assumed that the number of new referrals to the PACT CPS clinic increased as well; however, this was not defined by the data evaluation. The study also anticipated that the minor changes in A1c and BP were due to pulling a mix of well-established patients and new patients in the clinics in each time period. Additionally, though the study showed that shifting the primary modality of care from face-to-face to virtual has not affected consistency in care or quality of care for the veterans, the veterans' viewpoints and satisfaction with this major shift in provision of care has not yet been assessed. Further long term outcomes data since switching to more virtual care would need to be evaluated, though do not expect any worsening of care based on this and previous studies.15,[23][24][25]",
