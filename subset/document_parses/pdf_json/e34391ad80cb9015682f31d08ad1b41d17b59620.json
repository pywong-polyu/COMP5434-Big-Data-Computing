Although guidelines are available for the treatment of COPD, evidence suggests that management of COPD in clinical practice is not always aligned with this guidance. This study aimed to further understand the current use of COPD maintenance medication in the US. Patients and Methods: This study was an analysis of data from the Adelphi Respiratory Disease Specific Programme (DSP\u2122) 2019. Point-in-time data were collected from participating US physicians and their COPD patients. Physicians were either primary care physicians (PCPs) or pulmonologists, with a minimum workload of \u22653 COPD patients per month. Patients were aged \u226518 years with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of COPD. Results: In total, 171 physicians completed the survey (92 PCPs and 79 pulmonologists). Mean patient age was 66.4 years, 45% were female, with moderate COPD in 49.4% of patients and severe/very severe in 19.3%. Pulmonologists more frequently prescribed dual bronchodilation and triple therapy than PCPs, whereas inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting \u03b2 2 -agonist was more frequently prescribed by PCPs than pulmonologists. For both physician types, the most common reason for prescribing their patients' current treatment was 24-hour symptom relief. The majority of PCPs (70.1%) and pulmonologists (71.9%) reported referring to COPD guidelines when making treatment decisions. Conclusion: Prescribing patterns for COPD patients were found to differ between PCPs and pulmonologists. Improved physician understanding of how to tailor treatment for each patient, based on current symptoms and exacerbation risk, could help optimize patient care in COPD.",

            "text": "Despite the availability of international and national treatment guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), evidence suggests that available therapies may not be utilized to their full potential to optimize disease management and outcomes for patients. [1] [2] [3] COPD treatment guidelines are frequently updated, which presents a challenge for physicians managing patients with COPD. Furthermore, several new COPD medications have been approved in recent years. 4, 5 Current recommendations from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) indicate that each treatment regimen needs to be individualized, as the relationship between symptom severity, airflow limitation, and severity of exacerbations differs between patients. 4 Pharmacotherapy based on the patient's GOLD group (symptom severity and number/severity of exacerbations in the last year) can include a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or long-acting \u03b2 2 -agonist (LABA), alone or in combination, with addition of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) if indicated by the patient's exacerbation history in the past year (\u22652 moderate or resulting in hospitalization). Triple inhaled therapy of LABA, LAMA, and ICS (ie LABA/LAMA/ICS) improves lung function, symptoms, health status, and reduces exacerbations compared with LABA/ICS, LAMA/LABA, or LAMA monotherapy. 4 To ensure optimal management and outcomes for patients with COPD, it is important to understand how treatment guidelines are translated into real-world clinical practice and identify barriers to the implementation of best practice. Historical data from observational studies have shown that COPD management in routine clinical practice is not always aligned with guideline recommendations. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] COPD has a high prevalence in the US. During 2014-2015, 5.9% of adults (more than 15.9 million) reported having been told by their healthcare professional that they have COPD, and the average age-adjusted mortality rate for COPD was 39.7 per 100,000 population. 12 There is a lack of published evidence on current treatment patterns in real-world clinical practice in the US, and how these prescribing patterns align with COPD guidelines, such as GOLD. 4 In addition, little information is available on the reasoning behind prescribing behaviors for specific COPD medications and classes by US primary care physicians (PCPs) and pulmonologists.",

Each participating physician completed a patient record form for consecutive COPD patients. The patients were asked to complete a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) questionnaire, in which they provided their CAT score on the survey date. This score was used to derive their GOLD classification (A-D). No other patient-reported data were included in this analysis. Other information was recorded on the survey date from available medical history. No follow-up data were collected. Importantly, all data analyzed in this study were collected prior to the emergence of COVID-19. The DSP survey was conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki, adhering to the ICC/ESOMAR International code on observational research, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines. The survey received ethical exemption determination by the Western Institutional Review Board, a central international review board for the US (Study Number: 1-1211337-1). Patients provided written consent before completing the questionnaire. All data from physicians and patients were anonymized.",

This screening criteria threshold was chosen to ensure that data were collected from a sample of physicians who regularly treat patients with COPD, whilst not limiting the sample of physicians to those who have a very high COPD workload/specialism. Patients were required to be aged \u226518 years with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of COPD (including emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis). Note, International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes were not captured in this study. Patients with a concomitant asthma diagnosis (as confirmed by the physician) were excluded from this analysis, as were patients currently enrolled in a clinical study. To avoid selection bias, physicians were asked to provide data for a consecutive series of patients; this was a pragmatic sample as the program criteria did not require patient samples to be representative of the population in terms of race, income, social class, or age.",

Almost half of the patients were judged by their physician to have moderate COPD (49.4%; Table 1 ), with severe/very severe in 19.3%. The physician-perceived severity of COPD (Table 2) was worse for pulmonologist patients than for PCP patients (more patients perceived as severe or very severe).

For COPD patients with dyspnea, guidelines recommend the use of a LAMA/LABA combination over LABA or LAMA monotherapy. Guidelines recommend escalation to triple therapy with ICS/LAMA/LABA in patients with a history of one or more severe exacerbations in the past year. 4,5 Despite Notes: a n = 243 for CAT score and GOLD groups; b n = 185 for CAT score; c n = 184 for GOLD group. these guideline recommendations, our study shows that an ICS-containing regimen was prescribed for the majority of patients and at a similar rate by PCPs and pulmonologists. This could be due to the PCPs' familiarity and experience using ICS/LABAs, which have been long-standing treatment options in COPD, or possibly an uncertainty among PCPs in applying symptoms/exacerbation history to guide treatment choice or use of newer treatment options.

            "text": "For most patients consulting a PCP at the survey date, their current COPD treatment was initiated by a PCP, rather than a pulmonologist, indicating that COPD patients in the US are more likely to be seen outside of specialist care. Many PCPs do not have easy access to pulmonary function testing to aid in the diagnosis and classification of COPD patients. The uptake of tools for patient-reported outcomes, such as the CAT or modified Medical Research Council scale, may also be low among PCPs. Therefore, they may not have the information needed to stratify patients and comply with bestpractice treatment from evidence-based guidelines. 4 The drivers of treatment decisions among the physicians sampled were related to sustained symptomatic control and improvement; improvement of dyspnea was a frequent reason identified by physicians for the current treatment choice and also for a change to a current treatment. It was surprising that exacerbation was not more highly used as a factor guiding treatment decisions, as a patient's exacerbation history is an important factor in predicting and managing their future exacerbation risk. 4 This highlights a potential need for further education among physicians on the importance of proactively managing exacerbation risk to provide continued protection from exacerbations. Current guidelines recommend that physicians should direct treatment to the predominant 'treatable COPD trait' rather than COPD severity. 4 This highlights the importance of treatment based upon individual patient factors and uncovers another potential educational gap. Medication cost should also be considered, as treatment affordability may also play a role in treatment decisions, however, in this study, cost was not included in the list of factors influencing COPD treatment choices provided to the physicians. As well as physician factors, for example awareness of guideline recommendations, patient factors may also influence the management of their disease. In some cases, patients may be resistant to a change in COPD medication, possibly due to poor understanding of their disease or the severity of their symptoms. 16 Treatment adherence is also an issue. Patients using their medication sporadically and lack of education on inhaler technique have been identified as possible factors contributing to clinical inertia in COPD. 16 The results of this study also suggest a potential disconnect between physician perception of adherence to guidelines, and their actual prescribing patterns. The high rate of ICS use suggests that the guidelines are not being closely adhered to, despite many physicians reporting referral to guidelines in treatment.",
