This commentary describes the spontaneous formation of an international team of 115 researchers who summarized the literature on safe methods for decontaminating N95 filtering facepiece respirators in response to the supply crisis. The summary reports and fact sheets on the (www.n95decon. org) website have had more than 200 000 unique visits and the organization's webinars have reached health care professionals from more than 50 countries. The team is extending its mission to cover other personal protective equipment. The success of these collaborations may alter how scientific questions are tackled in the future.",

On 16 March 2020, six Bay Area counties imposed a shelter-in-place order requiring everyone to stay at home, making an exception for certain essential needs. Across the country, universities blocked access to classrooms and laboratories, forcing faculty, researchers, post-docs, staff, and students to stay home. Many academics recognized the severity of the pandemic and wanted to contribute what they could to reduce the health impact while they were trapped at home. Researchers from various universities spontaneously linked up on emerging digital platforms to tackle questions related to epidemiology and modeling, treatments, diagnostic testing, personal protective equipment, and other issues.",

The group acknowledged upfront that N95 FFRs are not designed to be decontaminated and should normally be disposed of after each patient encounter to avoid risk of infection and cross contamination. However, given the crisis situation, and even with the CDC's guidance on extending the lifespan of N95 FFRs to a full day (CDC, 2020a), some hospitals quickly exhausted their supply of N95 FFRs, leaving nurses and doctors with no choice but to reuse the same N95 FFR day after day.",

Fortunately, over the past 16 years, the FDA, NIH, and CDC/NIOSH had anticipated a potential N95 FFR supply problem after the international experiences with the recent major epidemics: 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), 2009 swine flu, 2012 MERS, and 2014-2016 Ebola. These agencies invested in laboratory research to evaluate various methods to safely decontaminate N95 FFRs. The methods tested include heat (moist and dry); submerging the mask in soapy water, solutions of alcohol, bleach, or hydrogen peroxide; hydrogen peroxide vapor; ethylene oxide; UV-C light; autoclave; and microwave irradiation. The studies investigated the effects of decontamination methods on N95 FFR performance and/or inactivation of microorganisms. Respirator performance was measured via filter efficiency, flow rate, and quantitative fit testing using mannequins. Effects of decontamination methods on microorganism inactivation were evaluated using biological indicators (e.g. spore strips) or N95 FFRs inoculated with microbes (e.g. Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores, phage, influenza) (Viscusi et al., 2007 (Viscusi et al., , 2009 Bergman et al., 2010 , Battelle, 2016 Heimbuch and Harnish, 2019) .",
