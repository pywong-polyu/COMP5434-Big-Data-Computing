Those suspected of having the disease receive a message regarding their health status, and healthcare providers then call them and guide them. Also, the their residences are disinfected and other family members are quarantined if required. If they do not improve within 3 days, they are referred to the emergency department of a hospital.

During the pandemic, many efforts have been made to find effective and efficient solutions for the initial management of COVID-19 globally. One of the significant factors, which is been emphasized today, is the important role of community engagement in the management and screening of infected patients. People's attitudes toward the disease and understanding of its consequences if left untreated have played an important role in encouraging their participation in self-screening through designed website. The government has allocated >17,000 health houses and >9,000 comprehensive health centers in urban, suburban, and rural areas throughout the country to support the plan. These centers, as community health centers, play an important role in these efforts; they are responsible for delivering integrated care services to the population in geographically defined areas. 11 In addition, this plan is consistent with the overall goal of developing health systems, strengthening their capacity to meet the needs of the community, and achieving universal health coverage.",

On one hand, this system helps in the initial identification of patients with COVID-19 infections and prevents any delay in clinical interventions. On the other hand, it prevents nonemergency referrals to emergency departments of hospitals. Implementing a simple strategy can be effective for the health system in dealing with this pandemic. Therefore, sharing our successful experience, which was the result of good cooperation and cohesion between the government and community, may be helpful for authorities in other countries. Based on available data, we considered patients with death outcome, as well as those admitted to ICU or under mechanical ventilation, as more severe cases. The information in this chart is based on hospitalized cases, and outpatients are not included in this calculation. Inclusion of outpatients and asymptomatic cases would decrease the proportion of severe cases. c To increase the sample size, the analysis of death cases was performed using the data from the previous week.
