Understanding viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for development of effective treatments. An Immune-Viral Dynamics Model (IVDM) is developed to describe SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics and COVID-19 disease progression. A dataset of 60 individual patients with COVID-19 with clinical viral load (VL) and reported disease severity were assembled from literature. Viral infection and replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, viral-induced cell death, and time-dependent immune response are incorporated in the model to describe the dynamics of viruses and immune response. Disease severity are tested as a covariate to model parameters. The IVDM was fitted to the data and parameters were estimated using the nonlinear mixed-effect model. The model can adequately describe individual viral dynamics profiles, with disease severity identified as a covariate on infected cell death rate. The modeling suggested that it takes about 32.6 days to reach 50% of maximum cell-based immunity. Simulations based on virtual populations suggested a typical mild case reaches VL limit of detection (LOD) by 13 days with no treatment, a moderate case by 17 days, and a severe case by 41 days. Simulations were used to explore hypothetical treatments with different initiation time, disease severity, and drug effects to demonstrate the usefulness of such modeling in informing decisions. Overall, the IVDM modeling and simulation platform enables simulations for viral dynamics and treatment efficacy and can be used to aid in clinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and dose-efficacy response analysis for COVID-19 drug development.",

Based on current knowledge, the main lung epithelial cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2, alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, have a limited regeneration capacity and take a few weeks to repopulate and regenerate in adult humans after acute injuries. 9-11 Therefore, a target-cell (T) limited viral dynamics model was developed to describe the biological mechanisms (Figure 1 ), and we ignore target cell regeneration in the current model and only estimate the initial size of SARS-CoV-2 susceptible target cell T 0 . After the cell is infected by the virus with an infectivity \u03b2, it becomes an infected cell (I), which can be actively killed at a per capita rate \u03b4 by mechanisms, including viral cytopathic effects, innate immunity, and cell-based adaptive immunity. The infected cells produce infectious viruses at a rate p. The virus is cleared at rate c from the host. We consider infected cell death rate may increase when SARS-CoV-2 adaptive immunity is generated, usually a few weeks post infection, 12, 13 similar to the scenario in influenza infection. 14 The immune-induced cell death rate is modeled with a timedependent immune effect assuming that it takes T 50 days of time to generate 50% of the maximum adaptive immunity with an added maximum immune-induced cell killing rate maximum unbound systemic concentration (I max ), and a Hill coefficient (n) for the immune response. The model equations are shown in Equation 1.",

As examples, viral production and clearance rates p and c are determined by the peak and overall setpoint VL. High viral production and low viral clearance produce a high VL peak and setpoint, and vice versa. The typical value of viral production rate was estimated as p = 3840 viruses per cell per day, and viral clearance rate was estimated as c = 25.4 per day. The viral infectivity was estimated as 5.97 \u00d7 10 \u2212 5 ml virion \u2212 1 day \u2212 1 . The density of target cells \u03bb was estimated as 5,760 cells/ ml. Note that \u03bb is not linked to physiological meaning as lack of data to inform susceptible cell number in lung tissue. Mechanistically, the rate of first phase VL decline depends on the rate of infected cell death, which was estimated as = 0.994, suggesting a half-life of the infected cells around 0.7 days. If without immune effect, VL will decline in a loglinear fashion until reaching below the LOQ. However, the fitted VL curves ( Figure 3) show a clear inflection point in many subjects, after which VL declines more rapidly. This suggests a second phase VL decline may be driven by adaptive immune effects and the inflection point informs the timedependent immune parameter T 50 and the slope of the second phase decline inform the maximum immune killing parameter I max . The Hill coefficient n was estimated as n = 8.18, and the time-dependent immune response parameters are estimated as T 50 = 32.6 days and I max = 175 day \u2212 1 . Note that the estimated large Hill coefficient suggests a steep immune response, whether this reflects the biological truth needs to be further validated with evidences from future studies. Fitting the model with fixed n = 5 was tested, which did not further improve the fits. Similar immune-controlled two-phase VL decay was also observed in other respiratory viral infections. 14 | 5",

Typical simulated VL dynamics go through a rapid exponential growth to the peak VL at around day 1 post symptom onset and start to decline after the peak. Note that the time to reach the peak VL is extremely short, which might not be biologically realistic. The current model starts from the time of symptom onset rather than of infection due to lack of data between infection and symptom onset. As a result, model parameters may be biased toward generating a rapid viral growth to capture the peak VL. Future human challenge study data may help address these issues. The peak has a >2 log10 variability between individuals, consistent with observed data. Table S4 shows summary statistics for simulated VL profiles in mild, moderate, and severe diseases. Notably, both VL duration and VL AUC are roughly doubled in severe cases than in mild cases, whereas the mean peak VL does not change as much, further suggesting that the duration rather than the height of VL may serve as a better indicator for disease severity.",

A 10-day treatment starting at day 0 may reduce the VL AUC by 8.7-fold, 9.0fold, and 7.4-fold for mild, moderate, and severe cases, respectively ( Figure 5 ). However, a less potent drug with effect at = 0.80 starting at day 0 may only reduce the VL AUC by ~4.5-fold compared to no treatment. Regardless of treatment duration and drug effect, magnitude of VL AUC reduction diminishes when start time of treatment is further delayed. If treatment is initiated 10 days post symptom onset in severe cases and ~5 days post symptom onset in mild and moderate cases, it will not effectively reduce any VL AUC comparing to no treatment ( Figure 5 ). This finding suggests the critical importance of early initiation of antiviral treatment, and is consistent with other modeling studies. 24, 25 Reduction in +VL duration is another important indicator for treatment efficacy, however, the simulations showed mixed results. For long-term treatment, simulations showed that with strong drug effect ( = 0.95), starting the treatment at day 1 post symptom onset can reduce +VL duration most significantly across disease severity levels ( Figure 6 ). Specifically, the +VL duration can be reduced from 11.3 to 8.2 days (27%) for mild disease, from 13.9 to 10.6 days (24%) for moderate disease, and from 20.0 to 16.8 days (16%) for severe disease. The effect for less potent drug ( = 0.80) is smaller, specifically 13%, 11%, and 7.5% for mild, moderate, and severe diseases, respectively ( Figure 6 ).

A target-cell limited model structure was adopted. Similar structural model was used to study other respiratory viral infections, such as IAV 17, 26 and RSV. 27 To characterize the rapid second phase decay in flu infection, Smith et al. developed a model to incorporate the adaptive immune response for the flu based on data from mice models, and suggested the fast second phase decay is contributed by immune-mediated viral suppression. 14 Due to limited data in COVID-19, a simplified time-dependent immune response was adopted to capture the fast second phase viral decay in this study, in which the generation of adaptive immunity is modeled with a time-dependent Hill function. Simulations based on the fitted model show that this modeling structure can capture the two-phase SARS-CoV-2 VL decay. Incorporating the adaptive immune response is important not only to correctly characterize viral dynamics, but also to enable improved predictions of treatment outcomes, as the immune response may impact the +VL duration. Two other SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics models also incorporated immune response mechanism. 25, 28 Goyal et al. implemented a multistage differentiation and maturing mechanism of SARS-COV-2-specific immune effector cells. 25 However, such a complex model would require more multifaceted data, which currently do not exist, to support and inform model parameters. Wang et al. incorporated the mechanism of lymphocytes recruitment to the site of infection to actively kill infected cells. 28 But it may also have difficulty to inform the recruitment rate parameter using only VL data.

[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The disease severity in this dataset were derived for each subject from the publications across all three disease severity levels. Because the SARS-CoV-2 VL typically serves as a biomarker and end point in COVID-19 treatment drug development and clinical trials, it is important to understand the connections between SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics and COVID-19 severity. This dataset augmented with disease severity allow us to develop and justify the IVDM model structure, estimate model parameters with reasonable precision, and build the association between viral dynamics and disease severity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The data show significant correlations between +VL duration and disease severity (Figure 4 ), such correlations have been consistently shown in other experimental studies. 20, 21 Covariate analysis of the IVDM identified the disease severity as a significant covariate on infected cell death rate, which is likely controlled by multiple factors including innate immune response, 30 adaptive immune response, and infection-induced cytotoxicity. Viral infection-induced programmed cell death has been acknowledged as part of the innate immunity against viral infection. 30 Numerous studies have shown the importance of innate immunity and the coordination between innate and adaptive immunity in relation to COVID-19 severity. 13 Our IVDM modeling results suggest that slow infected cell death rate, which may be caused by a weak innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2, can lead to prolonged +VL duration and further lead to more severe cases of COVID-19. The model did not identify association of disease severity with other model parameters, such as viral clearance. Infected cell death is a slower process than viral clearance, therefore it dominates the natural viral decay rate as the rate limiting step in this process. More clinical/immunology data would be helpful to further reveal the mechanism of disease severity. Currently there is not a biomarker allowing predicting disease severity a priori, the IVDM model with disease severity covariate can provide a useful tool to simulate treatment outcomes in different severities.",

This is on the same order of magnitude as the estimate based on murine coronavirus. 31 However, direct measurements from SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking. In addition, note the estimated value of p is correlated with viral infectivity \u03b2. Future data to inform values of both viral production and infectivity parameters are desired. Viral load profile of a few subjects was not well captured by current model, such as subjects 10004, 10007, and 20009 ( Figure 3 ). Additional mechanisms may be needed to explain the viral persistence observed in subjects 10004 and 10007. Regeneration of target cells may be incorporated to sustain longer term viral infection and replication. Subject 20009 shows an interesting VL profile that reaches the below LOQ level around day 15 and followed by a rebound back to 10 4 copies/ml level. This post-suppression breakthrough may be explained by failed immune control or viral infiltration to other organs to flare up additional viral replications.

The model predicted that late initiation of treatment would show larger reduction in +VL duration in short-term treatment, and initiating treatment immediately post symptom onset may prolong the +VL duration rather than reduce it. These counterintuitive results are because the model assumes that the infection will not stop until all the cells are infected, which might not be true, as it is evident that in most mild/moderate cases with no need for hospitalization, the host may spontaneously control the viral infection before all the target cells (lung epithelial cells) are infected and killed. The assumptions need to be revisited and tested when more data are available. It also should be cautious when interpreting +VL duration in clinical setting as large reduction in +VL duration may not directly translate to clinical benefits. These counterintuitive results may also be attributed to lack of other viral suppression mechanisms in the current model, such as immune response to maintain a sustained viral suppression after treatment ended. To compensate the effect of lacking immune suppression, the model used late treatment initiation to suppress late-phase viral dynamics from post-treatment rebound. A more mechanistic immune module in future models may help with this issue.",

A clinical dataset was assembled from literature with longitudinal VL and individual disease severity. The model parameters were estimated using the dataset with reasonable precision, and the model can adequately capture and explain the VL data. Simulations have been performed to explore possible clinical outcomes in response to different treatment options. The IVDM can serve as a platform to aid in drug development for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, for example, it can be used to deconvolve the effect of the baseline VL at the beginning of treatment when modeling the drug effect and can also be used to model the treatment effect reflected in increasing VL clearance slopes.",

Emerging knowledge and data in the coming months/years will allow further model refinement and qualification. Currently available treatment data are not adequate to inform treatment effects on SARS-CoV-2 virology. Incorporation of VL time course clinical data from antiviral therapies with demonstrated perturbations in the VL profile will be important to fully inform drug effect elements and underlying viral system parameters in this model.",
