In late 2019, the first clusters of viral pneumonia of unknown origin had been identified in Wuhan, China , and by March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had classified COVID-19 as a global pandemic (Bialek et al., 2020) . Initial estimates of its case fatality rate (~1e3%) were lower than SARS (11%), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (34%), and Ebola (25e90%) (Bialek et al., 2020; WHO, 2020a WHO, , 2020b WHO, , 2003 . However, COVID-19's propensity to spread before symptoms appeared in infected individualsdcoupled with an overall asymptomatic ratio of >30% (Nishiura et al., 2020) dresulted in a relatively high reproduction number of 1.5e3.5 in the absence of mitigation measures (Eisenberg, 2020) .",

COVID-19 is primarily respiratory in nature, but early studies confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the feces of infected individuals (W\u20ac olfel et al., 2020; Zang et al., 2020) , possibly due to co-infection of cells within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract . This alternative infection route was previously hypothesized for MERS (Zhou et al., 2017) and may explain why the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in feces even after it is no longer detected in oral and nasal swabs . To date, isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from fecal samples has been unsuccessful in multiple studies (W\u20ac olfel et al., 2020; Zang et al., 2020) , although one study observed entry into Vero cells using SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a single patient . Zang et al. (2020) hypothesized that although SARS-CoV-2 had the potential to infect cells within the GI tract, the virus appeared to be inactivated rapidly by colonic fluids, in contrast with enteric rotavirus. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in urine in W\u20ac olfel et al. (2020), but infectious SARS-CoV-1 was detected in urine in the past (Xu et al., 2005) .",

But with respect to environmental applications, much of the scientific community focused on the application of wastewater surveillance or wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to characterize COVID-19 in communities throughout the world . Wastewater surveillance involves monitoring chemical or microbiological targets to gain insight into the behaviors or characteristics of a community. This approach has been used to characterize opioid abuse (Gushgari et al., 2019) , to facilitate polio eradication (Hovi et al., 2012) , and as an 'early warning' signal for the spread of viral gastroenteritis (Hellm er et al., 2014) . For SARS-CoV-2, this tool can potentially detect the initial occurrence or reemergence of COVID-19 in a local community , characterize trends in incidence or prevalence, and even complement case data to assess clinical testing coverage, in part because it captures both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections (WRF, 2020). As a 'pooled' sample, wastewater provides a broad representation of community health and can aid in characterizing viral strains circulating within a community with just a small number of samples (WRF, 2020) .",

Numerous studies have reported detection and/or quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in untreated wastewater Gonzalez et al., 2020; Green et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020; Miyani et al., 2020; Nemudryi et al., 2020; Sherchan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b) , treated wastewater (Wurtzer et al., 2020) , and wastewater-associated solids . However, the methods in these early studies vary widely, potentially confounding comparisons across studies. The objectives of the current study were to (1) characterize the performance of several sample collection, processing, and analysis methods; (2) attempt to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in two Southern Nevada sewersheds and in wastewaterimpacted surface water; and (3) better understand the potential link between clinically-confirmed COVID-19 case data and concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. The knowledge gained during this early phase of the pandemic is valuable for continued efforts related to COVID-19 and for future implementation of wastewater surveillance to address other emerging public health challenges.",

For this sampling location, approximately 3% of the flow originates from solids dewatering.

Preliminary experiments with PEG followed by chloroform-butanol extraction (1:1 v/v) indicated loss of SARS-CoV-2 signal so this extraction step was omitted from the study (see Table S5 for additional information). To maximize equivalent sample volume (ESV) for the Centricons, up to three successive centrifugations (3500\u00c2g for 20e30 min at 10 C) were performed, each time recording and discarding the filtrate volume and then adding additional sample volume to the device.

The signal may also depend on whether the sample is a grab versus composite, the type of composite (e.g., time-proportional vs. flowproportional), and the time of day when it is collected (Ort et al., 2010b) .

D. Gerrity, K. Papp, M. Stoker et al. Water Research X 10 (2021) 100086 primary effluent (Centricon only), and grab primary effluent samples from Facility 1 (HFUF-Centricon). For both SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV, the concentrations adjusted for method-specific recovery were consistently higher in both composite samples (Table S3) , which was also observed in Curtis et al. (2020) . SARS-CoV-2 concentrations were 1 order of magnitude higher on average, and PMMoV concentrations were 1e2 orders of magnitude higher. As shown in Fig. S1 , dispersion might cause primary effluent concentrations to be lower than raw influent samples for a rare constituent, but with the exception of one day for PMMoV, concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV were similar between corresponding composite influents and composite primary effluents. Therefore, the consistently higher signals in the composite samples might be attributable to time differences. The grab primary effluent samples corresponded with the minimum flow for Facility 1 so loadings of SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV might increase later in the day. Additional testing would be needed to confirm this diurnal variation. With respect to sample processing, numerous approaches were evaluated throughout the duration of the study. The methods were evaluated based on equivalent sample volume and recovery of spiked BCoV and native PMMoV, for which data are summarized in Table 3 . It was initially assumed that secondary concentration methods would be needed to maximize ESV for SARS-CoV-2 detection, hence the selection of HFUF-Centricon for routine monitoring of 10-L samples. Hill et al. (2007) previously demonstrated >70% recovery of MS2 and phiX174 using this combined approach. Although secondary concentration was able to increase ESVs (e.g., 0.55 \u00b1 0.05 mL for HFUF vs. 11 \u00b1 2.8 mL for HFUF-Centricon), secondary concentration resulted in a notable decrease in BCoV recovery (e.g., 54 \u00b1 11% for HFUF vs. 2.1 \u00b1 0.87% for HFUF-Centricon). Furthermore, spiking BCoV at different stages of sample processing (see Text S1) confirmed that performance deteriorated during secondary concentration. For example, primary concentration with Centricon resulted in a high yet variable BCoV recovery (55 \u00b1 38%), similar to the MS2 recovery observed in Medema et al. (2020) . However, when isolating secondary concentration, BCoV recovery by Centricon dropped to 9.4 \u00b1 9.5%. A similar decrease in performance was observed for PEG when used for secondary concentration following HFUF, with the overall HFUF-PEG method achieving only 0.34% recovery of BCoV. In contrast, using PEG for primary concentration resulted in higher recoveries of 11 \u00b1 8.4%. In a small number of split samples, direct extraction of the HFUF concentrate appeared to be slightly more sensitive than the overall HFUF-Centricon approach. HFUF alone achieved a greater number of positive qPCR assays/reactions in 8 of 10 split samples, although concentrations corrected for ESV and recovery were nearly identical between the two methods (<1.5-fold difference for SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV). For all methods, PMMoV recovery was~1 order of magnitude lower than BCoV recovery.",

            "text": "Considering the higher observed concentrations in composite samples with reduced volume, the lack of a clear benefit of secondary concentration, and the costs associated with additional processing, primary concentration with HFUF (current study), PEG precipitation (Wu et al., 2020b) , Centricon ultrafilters , or electronegative filtration should be adequate for wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. Other viable options appear to be ultracentrifugation (Green et al., 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020) or even direct extraction from sludge ). In the current study, BCoV concentrations were low for extracted solids from spiked samples (Table 3) , although solids partitioning in the recovery experiments may not have accurately mimicked partitioning in actual samples (samples were rocked for 10 min after spiking with BCoV). Ye et al. (2016) estimated~15% adsorption of enveloped viruses to wastewater solids under equilibrium conditions. During routine monitoring, only 26% and 13% of extracted solid samples from Facility 1 and Facility 2, respectively, were positive for one or more SARS-CoV-2 assays (maximum of 2 positive assays and 2 positive reactions for a single sample). Peccia et al. (2020) employed a nucleic acid extraction kit specifically designed for solid samples, which may have improved recovery from sludge and SARS-CoV-2 detection in that study. Nevertheless, the data provide some indication of when COVID-19 initially spiked and then peaked in the communitydat which point just over 0.007% of the population was confirmed positive each day. The number of new cases generally waned after the first week of April but then increased in early May when there was an increase in testing rate. The constant decrease in hospitalizations and deaths through the end of May (Fig. S2 ), coupled with a higher frequency of non-detects in wastewater (described later), suggest that the increase in new cases in early May was largely a function of increased testing. Following the peak, the 7-day moving average fluctuated between 57 and 111 new cases per daydor 0.002e0.005% of the population. By the end of May, there were 6719 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (0.29% relative prevalence), 1565 Table 3 Summary of equivalent sample volumes (ESVs) and virus recoveries as a function of sample concentration method and target matrix. Sample concentration and analysis focused on liquid-phase viruses, except where solids are specified. The HFUF-Centricon method was applied to wastewater (10-L samples) and source/drinking water (10e20-L samples). All other methods were tested only with wastewater. ESVs indicate the volume of original sample reflected in each assay after accounting for sample concentration, sample processing, and molecular analyses. related hospitalizations (23% of confirmed cases), and 343 related deaths (5% of confirmed cases) in Southern Nevada. Fig. 3 summarizes the wastewater flow data for Facilities 1 and 2 between March and May of 2019 and 2020. Because of its service area, Facility 1 was significantly impacted by the closure of casinos and hotels along the Las Vegas Strip in mid-March. Facility 2, which serves primarily residential areas, experienced minimal impacts from COVID-19 mitigation measures, although average daily flows may have increased slightly due to people spending a greater amount of time at home. At both facilities, peak flow shifted~2 h later in the day when comparing 2019 versus 2020. Because the shift was observed in both facilities, with one experiencing lower flows and the other experiencing normal/higher flows, the shift was presumably due to behavioral changes rather than hydraulics. Fig. 2 . Clinically confirmed COVID-19 case data for Southern Nevada (SNHD, 2020). New cases were assigned based on when data were reported to the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) and not based on symptom onset. Numbers in parentheses indicate case data relative to an overall population of approximately 2.3 million people. A statewide closure of non-essential businesses was ordered on March 17th, phase 1 reopening began on May 9th, and phase 2 reopening began on May 29th. As noted earlier, the grab primary effluent samples collected between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. correspond with the minimum observed flow rate at Facility 1, after accounting for the 5-h hydraulic retention time of the primary clarifier. Fig. 4 summarizes the routine monitoring data for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. For Facilities 1 and 2, respectively, N1 was detected in 64% and 9% of all samples, N2 was detected in 48% and 45%, E_Sarbeco was detected in 20% and 0%, and orf1a was detected in 8% and 0%. The average Cqs for the samples with detections were 33.8 \u00b1 1.4 for N1, 35.1 \u00b1 1.6 for N2, 35.2 \u00b1 1.1 for E_Sarbeco, and 33.3 \u00b1 1.8 for orf1a. Similar inconsistency in assay results has been reported by Ahmed et al. (2020) in Australia, Medema et al. (2020) in the Netherlands, and Nemudryi et al. (2020) in Montana. On the other hand, Wu et al. (2020b) observed relatively consistent detections of N1, N2, and N3 in Massachusetts, and Green et al. (2020) observed consistent detections for all quantifiable samples in upstate New York. One study noted that inconsistency across assays might result from increasing prevalence of genetic variants (Penarrubia et al., 2020) , but similar to Ahmed et al. (2020) , many positive samples in the current study were near the LoDs and LoQs for the respective assays, which may have resulted in variability between gene targets with differing sensitivities. There were no detections during the first week of March, but there was a detection of N1 at Facility 1 on March 9th, which is consistent with the first confirmed clinical case in the local community. Both Peccia et al. (2020) and Medema et al. (2020) detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater prior to confirmed cases in several communities.",

            "text": "With four SARS-CoV-2 assays and duplicate reactions for each assay, there were a total of eight qPCR reactions for each sample. Only several samples were positive for multiple assays, and many samples were positive for only one qPCR replicate for a given assay. Therefore, the number of positive reactions was used as a semiquantitative indication of the strength of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic signal. For Facility 1, the peak signal occurred on April 13th when 4 assays and 6 of 8 total reactions were positive; several samples between March 30th and April 27th had at least 3 positive assays and 4 of 8 positive reactions. This semi-quantitative peak was somewhat consistent with the clinical peak in Fig. 2 . Facility 2 never exceeded 2 positive assays and/or reactions, with the peak occurring sometime between April 13th and April 27th. Therefore, there was some temporal consistency in the data from Facilities 1 and 2, and the fact that the genetic signal was seemingly stronger at Facility 1 is consistent with the clinical data for each service area. As of May 31st, the relative prevalence in the service area for Facility 2 was 0.22% based on confirmed cases, while the relative prevalence in the immediate area surrounding Facility 1 was 0.40% on average and as high as 0.65% in one area (Fig. S3 ) (SNHD, 2020) . With respect to gene copy (gc) concentrations, there was only one sample from Facility 1 that was >LoQ and positive for both qPCR replicates (3.6 \u00c2 10 4 gc/L for N1 on April 27th) and one sample from Facility 2 (1.2 \u00c2 10 5 gc/L for N2 on April 28th). Multiple samples at Facility 1 were quantifiable based on single qPCR replicates, while only one additional sample was technically quantifiable at Facility 2. In general, concentrations at both facilities appeared to fluctuate between 10 4 and 10 6 gc/L. The average PMMoV concentration was approximately 4.5 \u00c2 10 9 gc/L at both facilities, which is consistent with the literature (Symonds et al., 2018) .",

The concentrations reported in Wu et al. (2020b) were slightly lower than the current study, although confirmed COVID-19 prevalence in their Massachusetts study area was also an order of magnitude lower at that time. That study did not appear to correct for virus recovery, and concentrations may have also been impacted by pasteurization prior to analysis. For areas with similar clinical prevalence or death rates, reported concentrations were either several orders of magnitude lower , relatively consistent (Green et al., 2020) , or approximately one order of magnitude higher (Wurtzer et al., 2020) than the observed data in Southern Nevada. As noted in Ahmed et al.

Feces production rate is fairly well characterized in the literature with a median of 126e250 g/person-d, depending on location (Rose et al., 2015) . Wastewater flow rate is also relatively straightforward when using average daily flow for a particular facility, although there could be artifacts of sample collection (e.g., influent vs. primary effluent and grab vs. composite) that affect the composition of the sample and how that should be considered in the model. At this time, the major source of uncertainty is the fecal shedding rate and how that varies over time, between individuals (e.g., symptomatic vs. asymptomatic), and across other demographic factors. W\u20ac olfel et al. (2020) provided an initial assessment demonstrating that fecal shedding rate varied by several orders of magnitude for a given person, with a maximum shedding rate early in the infection period and then a steady decline over as long as~30 days (Fig. S4) . Zheng et al. (2020) reported similar viral loads in stool samples and a similar shedding duration but did not observe any clear trends over time. Assuming the W\u20ac olfel et al. (2020) trajectory, a simple mass balance approach may not be appropriate for determining overall prevalence within a community, particularly for a prolonged outbreak, but may provide a reasonable indication of new cases, or incidence, that might dominate the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater load.",

            "text": "Using the simple mass balance approach, we assumed a feces production rate of 126 g/person-d, an initial fecal shedding rate of 10 8.9 gc/g for new cases (adapted from W\u20ac olfel et al., 2020; see Fig. S4 ), and average SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations across all assays (including estimated concentrations < LoQ) from the routine monitoring samples. These calculations resulted in estimates of 200 new cases per day for Facility 1 and~20 new cases per day for Facility 2, which equates to 0.02e0.03% daily relative incidence. Considering that confirmed daily relative incidence was 0.004% on average in April and May (Fig. 2) , the wastewater estimates indicate the ascertainment ratio was approximately 5e8 in Southern Nevada during this period. This is in general agreement with Wu et al. (2020a) , which suggested the ascertainment ratio was on the order of 3e20 in the United States early in the pandemic. Green et al. (2020) used ratios of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., infected fecal load) to crAssphage (i.e., total fecal load) as an indirect estimate of disease prevalence, while the current study focused on PMMoV to estimate incidence. SARS-CoV-2:PMMoV ratios in the current study suggested an average of~30 new cases per day for Facility 1 across the entire study period (i.e., 0.003% relative incidence), with an apparent peak occurring between March 23rd and April 20th. For Facility 2, the peak ratio occurred on April 14th indicating~15 new cases per day (i.e., 0.025% relative incidence), and the remaining data suggested fewer than 2 new cases per day (i.e., 0.003% relative incidence). These ratio-based estimates appear to align more closely with the confirmed clinical data for Southern Nevada (Fig. 2) , even without adjusting for asymptomatic infections or ascertainment ratio. Fig. 5 illustrates an alternative framework for estimating SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in Facility 1 wastewater, specifically accounting for the time-dependent shedding rate of infected individuals. In the underlying model (see Text S3), the fecal shedding rate followed the trajectory illustrated in Fig. S4 (i.e., decreasing from a maximum of 10 8.9 gc/g to 1 gc/g over 25 days), an adaptation of W\u20ac olfel et al. (2020) . The number of new cases per day was based on 50% of the clinically confirmed daily cases reported for Southern Nevada (SNHD, 2020), since Facility 1 serves approximately half of the local population, but the model also assumed an asymptomatic ratio of 50% (Day, 2020) , or an ascertainment ratio of 2. An infected individual was assumed to no longer be shedding once the shedding rate dropped below 1 gc/g. The SARS-CoV-2 load from all shedding individuals on a given day was divided by the corresponding average daily flow for Facility 1. Considering that the model predicts concentrations of 10 2 -10 3 gc/ L early in the outbreak (i.e., <LoD for this study) and that the first wastewater detection occurred during that time (i.e., March 9th), it is unlikely that the confirmed case load accurately represented COVID-19 incidence/prevalence in the community at that time. Consistent wastewater detections of SARS-CoV-2 occurred once the confirmed daily case load and cumulative cases exceeded 0.001% relative incidence and 0.01% relative prevalence, respectively. This corresponds with model concentrations of~10 4 gc/L or higher, which is consistent with the observed LoDs for the SARS-CoV-2 assays. The strongest observed wastewater signal, as determined by the number of positive assays and replicate reactions (see Fig. 4 ), occurred when the confirmed daily case load and cumulative cases reached 0.01% relative incidence and 0.1% relative prevalence, respectively, which corresponds with a model concentration of nearly 10 5 gc/L. The observed wastewater concentrations were generally in agreement with the model predictions, although some samples exhibited high variability between the four molecular targets.",

Based on this shedding framework, wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 may be a useful leading indicator of COVID-19 when the case load is increasing by orders of magnitude over a short period of time. But due to inherent variability in SARS-CoV-2 methods, wastewater surveillance may not have sufficient resolution to detect small changes in daily case load. For much of the study period, observed and predicted wastewater concentrations fluctuated between 10 4 and 10 5 gc/L because daily relative incidence also fluctuated around 0.01% from late March through the end of May. Finally, the persistence of fecal shedding suggests that clinical data may be better suited to identify the waning portion of the COVID-19 epidemiological curve, although this could not be demonstrated in the current study because of the consistency in new daily cases through the end of May.",
