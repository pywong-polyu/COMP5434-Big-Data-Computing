Using hierarchical ascendant classification on principal component analysis of multidimensional variables, and multivariate analyses with generalised additive models, we assessed the associations between several factors (spatiotemporal spread of the epidemic between Feb 7 and March 17, 2020, the national lockdown, demographic population structure, baseline intensive care capacities, baseline population health and health-care services, new chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine dispensations, economic indicators, degree of urbanisation, and climate profile) and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates. Incidence rate was defined as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, mortality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per 100 000, and case fatality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases.",

There was an overall cumulative in-hospital incidence rate of 155\u00b76 cases per 100 000 inhabitants (range 19\u00b74-489\u00b75), in-hospital mortality rate of 26\u00b73 deaths per 100 000 (1\u00b71-119\u00b72), and in-hospital case fatality rate of 16\u00b79% (4\u00b78-26\u00b72). We found clear spatial heterogeneity of in-hospital COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates, following the spread of the epidemic. After multivariate adjustment, the delay between the first COVID-19-associated death and the onset of the national lockdown was positively associated with in-hospital incidence (adjusted standardised incidence ratio 1\u00b702, 95% CI 1\u00b701-1\u00b704), mortality (adjusted standardised mortality ratio 1\u00b704, 1\u00b702-1\u00b706), and case fatality rates (adjusted standardised fatality ratio 1\u00b701, 1\u00b701-1\u00b702). Mortality and case fatality rates were higher in departments with older populations (adjusted standardised ratio for populations with a high proportion older than aged >85 years 2\u00b717 [95% CI 1\u00b720-3\u00b790] for mortality and 1\u00b743 [1\u00b708-1\u00b788] for case fatality rate). Mortality rate was also associated with incidence rate (1\u00b70004, 1\u00b70002-1\u00b7001), but mortality and case fatality rates did not appear to be associated with baseline intensive care capacities.

To assess the factors associated with the spatial differences between incidence and mortality rates, we searched PubMed for all articles up to Sept 28, 2020 ). Some articles describing the initial COVID-19 clusters in France presented results of mechanistic or agent-based models at a coarse spatial scale, but none of the 456 articles described the first pandemic wave in France and analysed associated factors at a fine spatial scale. Similarly, the effect of the national lockdown in France was studied by only a few mechanistic or agent-based models. Worldwide, the importance of lockdown policies to drastically decrease COVID-19 cases and deaths was mostly suggested by model predictions, or by a few inter-country epidemiological comparisons. The influence of population age structure on COVID-19-associated mortality was highlighted at the country level but not studied at finer scales.",

Given the exponential number and spatial diffusion of new cases and clusters, the first official mitigation measures were gradually applied from March 5, 2020, such as a ban on gathering of more than 5000 people, then 1000 people (March 14) and 100 people (March 16). On March 15, the first round of municipal elections took place but unessential services, including restaurants and cafes, were closed, followed by schools and main religious services the next day. On March 17, as France had already recorded a total of 7730 cases and 175 deaths, and as incidence was doubling every 3 days, a national lockdown was ordered by the government, 14 and eventually extended until May 11. The daily incidence peak was reached on March 31, with 7578 new confirmed cases. However, considering the low level of testing capacities in France at this time of the epidemic, a model suggests that as many as 300 000 daily new infections might have occurred right before the lockdown onset. 15 Hampered by the lockdown, the epidemic reached the rest of the country more slowly. In these other departments, the first deaths generally occurred after lockdown implementation, except for specific departments such as Corse-du-Sud (Corsica Island) and Morbihan (Brittany region). In the southeastern region, the most densely populated department (Bouche-du-Rh\u00f4ne including Marseille, the second largest French city) was more affected than the surrounding ones, in terms of incidence and mortality rates.",

After classifying the multi dimensional variables and completing multivariate analyses of the spatial structure of the epidemic, the delay that elapsed between the first COVID-19-associated death and the onset of the lockdown appeared to be positively associated with in-hospital incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates. In other words, morbidity and mortality were lower in departments where the general lockdown caught the epidemic at an earlier stage of its expansion. This finding suggests that the lockdown was an effective way to control the diffusion of this wave of the epidemic across the country. This effect of the lockdown strategy is in line with other publications that are based on modelling or observational studies. Among them, Salje and colleagues 15 and Di Domenico and colleagues 24 estimated that the lockdown reduced the reproductive number by 77% in France and 81% in \u00cele-de-France. Using databases across 149 countries, Islam and colleagues 25 also estimated that earlier implementation of lockdown was associated with a larger reduction in the incidence of COVID-19. Mortality rate was also strongly associated with the incidence rate of in-hospital COVID-19 cases, even after adjusting for the interaction between incidence and the relative lag to lockdown. However, the number of ICU beds available in 2018 was not associated with mortality or case fatality rate. In addition, we found no association between baseline population health and health-care services and incidence and mortality rates. This finding suggests that hospitals managed to scale up their ICU capacity (\u2265100% increase in 21 departments; appendix p 19) or organise medical evacuations to less affected departments when necessary.",

We could not include data for in-hospital dispensations, which are not publicly available in France, and the prescription of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 was limited by a French regulation on May 26, 2020, after the end of our study period. Although univariate analyses showed important associations between in-hospital incidence and mortality rates and new chloroquine and hydroxy chloroquine dispensations, these associations were positive (ie, higher chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine dispensations were associated with higher incidence or mortality rates). This association suggests a common confounding by indication, 26 which was corrected by the multivariate analysis. Furthermore, our multivariate analysis explained almost all in-hospital COVID-19 incidence in the Paris and Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne depart ments, the two departments where chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine dispensations were the highest. The observed mortality in Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne was even higher than predicted by our model. Nevertheless, our ecological study was not designed to assess the effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 at the individual level; these drugs have been shown not to be effective. 27 Our multivariate model, which was adjusted for spatial heterogeneity and the delay between the first COVID-19 death and the start of the lockdown, did not identify any substantial association between in-hospital incidence and the four different climate zones, each of which hosts one of the four largest French metropolitan areas. Previous reports have suggested that temperature and humidity could affect the transmission of COVID-19. However, these studies analysed meteorological rather than climatic factors, or did not consider the temporal spread of the pandemic. 6 Our study has several limitations. We only analysed COVID-19 in-hospital data. Testing was too low in France during the first wave of the epidemic to provide an accurate estimation of outpatient incidence. Furthermore, data on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in retirement homes have not yet been made available at the department level. Criteria for admission to hospital might not have been homogeneous across the departments, and more people with milder symptoms of COVID-19 might have been admitted to hospital in less affected departments or depending on local care policies. 28 The age of patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19 has not been made available at the departmental level to account for these differences. This factor could partly account for why our multivariate analysis explained only 44\u00b76% of the case fatality rate. Additional factors might also have been associated with case fatality rate, suggesting a need for further analysis at a more accurate scale. For instance, it was not possible to analyse ethnicity, because this characteristic is not recorded in French databases for legal reasons.",
