In this study we compared influenza activity indicators in our country after the implementation of public health measures for COVID-19. We compared indicators of influenza activity in 2020 before and after public health measures were taken to reduce COVID-19 with the corresponding indicators from three preceding years and the immediate one, and the potential decrease in seasonal influenza cases/deaths. Nationwide surveillance data revealed a drastic decline in influenza diagnosis in outpatient clinics and public hospitals, influenza positivity rates of clinical specimens, and confirmed severe cases during the following 10 weeks of 2020 as lockdown activities and control measures were established compared with the same period of 2019. Our results suggest that the measures taken for COVID-19 were effective in reducing the spread of other viral respiratory diseases as influenza in our country.",

ILI were defined as fever (> 38 \u00b0C) and cough. ILI samples were tested by using influenza-specific real time RT-PCR assay to identify influenza virus infection and then percentage of influenza cases were registered per week. Deaths caused by confirmed influenza virus infection analyzed were taken from the total confirmed cases reported in the official weekly epidemiological reports, which are open and available to the public. We evaluated whether the influenza trends in the 2019-2020 season were different before and after the COVID-19 National Protocol for Healthy Distance was implemented compared to previous seasons by using a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference design. We extracted weekly reports of seasonal influenza cases data from the 2016-2017 season to the 2019-2020 season from epidemiological (EPI) week 40 to EPI week 30, using the open-access databases of the public health authority 4 .",

The healthy distance protocol was officially established in EPI week 13. It was observed that simultaneously the cases of influenza were decreasing and were unusually low after week 20 compared to previous years. Even when measures to contain the transmission of the new respiratory disease were established (EPI week 13), the number of COVID-19 cases increased while prevalence of influenza declined ( Fig. 2A) .

Until now, it is estimated that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%; therefore, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. However, for both diseases, mortality is determined to a large extent by regional access to and quality of healthcare services.",

As reported by other countries, public health initiatives to control COVID-19 spread probably helped to decrease influenza transmission and number of cases in May 2020 because www.nature.com/scientificreports/ both viruses share the same transmission mechanisms through the respiratory route and contact, although with different efficiency giving a basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for COVID-19 higher than that of seasonal influenza, then a reduction in transmission could reduce the impact of COVID-19, thereby preventing the increase of mortality. The modeling of the effective reproduction number for COVID-19 in Mexico in May 2020 (National Secretariat of Health) at 0.5-1, is lower (55-77% less) than the mean estimated R 0 for this virus (2.2) 7 . The observed 61% reduction in influenza transmission is consistent with the information above 8 . Due to the measures implemented in our country to contain the COVID-19 cases, there were severe changes in the availability of medical care and assistance, including hospitalization. Avoidance of medical care during this period may be a major confounder in interpreting our results. It is important to note that due to the similarity in symptoms between COVID-19 and influenza and the low number of COVID-19 patients in Mexico (< 200 cases as of March 21, 2020), ILI patients would seek help for a differential diagnosis. The reduction of the availability of medical care also did not explain the lower number of severe influenza cases seen in 2020 (Fig. 2C) . Therefore, we believe that the decline in influenza activity in Mexico in 2020 is the result of the strict control measures that were put in place in response to COVID-19.",

In contrast, some Asian regions experienced different trends in influenza incidence during this season, from those experienced in past years 9, 10 . The total number of patients infected with influenza in countries like Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan was significantly lower after EPI week 4 of the 2019-2020 season than in previous influenza seasons 11 . We can mention some limitations in our study. First, due to the seasonal bimodal pattern of influenza incidence in Mexico, it is expected that influenza cases diminish around March-May. However, this year the number of cases fell to almost zero. Second, it is important to consider an underdiagnosis of ILI's due to the fear of leaving home in search of medical attention and catching coronavirus, as well as being classified as COVID-19, all this contributes to generating an altered pattern 11 . Third, if we consider a similar dynamic for COVID-19, we will also have to record a higher number of cases for COVID-19 due to the underdiagnosis and the presentation of asymptomatic cases 12, 13 .",

Definitively, the containment measures to reduce the risk of contagion for the new respiratory disease was additionally efficient for influenza, but with greater magnitude. This is partly explained by the different transmission mechanisms of these two respiratory diseases, the virulence of each viral agent, the absence of immunity in the population, and the diverse virological factors inherent in each pathogen. Our results suggest that such measures are useful in reducing the spread of viral respiratory diseases and their establishment mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially now that we are entering into a new influenza season.",
