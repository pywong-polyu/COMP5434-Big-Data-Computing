The modified SEIQR pandemic model takes a groundbreaking approach to evaluate and monitor the COVID-19 epidemic. The complex studies presented in this paper are based on real-world data from Saudi Arabia. A reproduction number and a systematic stability analysis are included in the new version of SEIQR model dynamics. Using the Jacobian linearization process, we can obtain the domain of the solution and the state of equilibrium based on the modified SEIQR model. The equilibrium and its importance have been identified, and the disease-free stability of the equilibrium has been investigated. The reproduction number was calculated using internal metrics, and the global stability of the current model's equilibrium was demonstrated using Lyapunov's stability theorem. To see how well the SEIQR proposed model went, it was compared to real COVID-19 spread data in Saudi Arabia. According to the results, the new SEIQR proposed model is a good match for researching the spread of epidemics like COVID-19. In the end, we presented an optimal protocol to prevent the dissemination of COVID-19. Staying at home and transporting sick people as far as possible to a safe region is the most effective strategy to prevent COVID-19 spread. It is critical to offer infected people safe and effective treatment, as well as antibiotics and nutrients to non-affected people. To detect confirmed infections, we must provide more effective and reliable diagnostic methods. Furthermore, increasing THE AUTHORS.

            "text": "To explain transmission dynamics and estimate domestic and global disease spread based on data recorded from December 31, 2019, to January 28, 2020, Wu et al. [9] have implemented the Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered Model (SEIR). They also found that COVID-19 had a fundamental reproductive number of approximately 2.68. Read et al. [10] registered a value of 3.1 for the fundamental reproductive number based on the SEIR model data adaptation, assuming that the daily time spent by Poisson increases. Tang et al. [11] proposed a compartmental model of chronic disease development, human epidemiological status, and intervention measures that was deterministic. The authors found that the number of reproductive controls can be up to 6.47 and those engagement techniques, such as simplified traceability accompanied by insulation and quarantine, may minimize reproductive control numbers and risk of transmission effectively. To determine the scale of the disease outbreak in Wuhan, Iman [12] carried out calculational modeling of the possible epidemic tracks with an emphasis on human-to-human transmissions. Its findings suggest that controls must be efficiently controlled by well over 60% of the transmission. To analyze and forecast the infectivity of the new coronavirus, Guo et al. [13] developed a deep learning algorithm. They found that two animal hosts of this virus were bats and minks. Most of the models illustrate the significant role of a direct transmission mechanism between humans and humans in the outbreak, as demonstrated by the fact that many individuals infected in the Wuhan area have no interaction and the number of infections has been growing rapidly and spreading across the Chinese provinces and over 20 people [14] . There is a relatively long incubation period in many infected individuals, so they do not show symptoms and have not been aware of their infection for 10-14 days. Over time, the disease can easily be spread by direct exposure to other people. On the other hand, the published models have not, to date, considered the environmental position of COVID-19 transmission. Several different models have been constructed to study the COVID-19 outbreak [6, 8, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

The findings suggest that the SEIQR approach is an excellent tool for the study in Saudi Arabia and other countries of the transmission of diseases, such as COVID-19. Five measures are included in the optimal procedure, and guidance has been comprehensive in helping delay the spread of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.
