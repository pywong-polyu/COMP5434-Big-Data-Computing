However, the lack of interpretability of these models has painfully impeded their practical applications, as their outputs and working mechanisms suffer from the intransparent decision process and complex inner structures. We thus propose to adopt the post-hoc method to tackle the interpretability issue for deep learning based knowledge tracing (DLKT) models. Specifically, we focus on applying the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) method to interpret RNN-based DLKT model by backpropagating the relevance from the model's output layer to its input layer. The experiment results show the feasibility using the LRP method for interpreting the DLKT model's predictions, and partially validate the computed relevance scores. We believe it can be a solid step towards fully interpreting the DLKT models and promote their practical applications.",

Yet, the collected massive and consecutive exercise questions are usually associated with multiple concepts, and the traditional KT models cannot well handle the questions without explicit labels and capture the relationships among a large size of concepts (e.g., 100 or more concepts). Accordingly, deep learning models are recently introduced into the KT domain because of their powerful representation capability [12] . Given the sequential and temporal characteristics of learner's exercise data, the recurrent neural network (RNN) [14] is frequently adopted for building the deep learning based knowledge tracing (DLKT) models. Since it is difficult to directly measure the actual knowledge state of a learner, the existing DLKT models often adopt an alternative solution that minimizes the difference between the predicted and the real responses on exercise questions. Hence, the major output of DLKT models are the predicted performance on next questions. As a popular implementation variants of RNN, the long short-term memory (LSTM) unit [11] and GRU [7] are widely used in the DLKT models, and have achieved comparable or even better prediction performance in comparison to the traditional KT models [6, 12] .",

LRP method is applicable and empirically scales to general deep learning models. It has been adopted for image classification [1] , machine translation [8] and text analysis [2] .

The built DLKT model adopts the LSTM unit with the hidden dimensionality of 256. During the training process, the mini-batch size and the dropout are set to 20 and 0.5 respectively. Considering KT as a classification problem and the exercise results as binary variables, namely 1 representing correct and 0 representing incorrect answers, the overall prediction accuracy achieves 0.75. We conduct the experiment to understand the relationship between the LRP interpreting results and the model prediction results. Specifically, we choose 48,673 exercise sequences with a length of 15, i.e., each sequence consisting of 15 individual questions, as the test dataset for the interpreting tasks. For each sequence, we take its first 14 questions as the input to the built DLKT model, and the last one to validate the model's prediction on the 15th question. As the result, the DKLT model correctly predicts the last question for 34,311 sequences, where the positive and negative results are 25,005 and 9,306 respectively. Based on the correctly predicted sequences, we adopt the LRP method to calculate the relevance values of the first 14 questions, and then investigate whether the sign of relevance values is consistent with the correctness of learner's answer. Specifically, we define consistent question among the previous exercise questions as \"either the correctly-answered questions with a positive relevance value\" or \"the falsely-answered questions with a negative relevance value\". Accordingly, we compute the percentage of such consistent questions in each sequence, and name it as consistent rate. Intuitively, a high consistent rate reflects that most correctly-answered questions have a positive contribution and most falsely-answered questions have a negative contribution to the predicted mastery probability on the given concept. Figure 1 shows the histogram of the consistent rate on both groups of positive prediction (i.e., the mastery probability above 50%) and negative prediction (i.e., the mastery probability below 50%). Clearly, we see that the majority of the exercise sequences achieve 90% (or above) consistent rate, which partially validates the question-level feasibility of using LRP method to interpret DLKT model's prediction results.",
