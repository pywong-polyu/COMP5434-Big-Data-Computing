            "text": "Purpose of review Most aging Americans lack access to specialist palliative care aimed at those experiencing serious illness and/or high symptom burden at end of life. The curricula used by training programs for all healthcare professions should focus on helping learners develop the primary palliative care skills and competencies necessary to provide compassionate bias-free care for adults with serious illness. We believe there is much opportunity to improve this landscape via the incorporation of palliative care competencies throughout generalist healthcare professional programs. Recent findings Several recent publications highlight multiple issues with recruitment and retention of diverse students and faculty into healthcare professional training programs. There are also concerns that the curricula are reinforcing age, race, and gender biases. Due to these biases, healthcare professionals graduate from their training programs with socialized stereotypes unquestioned when caring for older adult minority patients and caregivers. Summary Important lessons must be incorporated to assure that bias against age, race, and gender are discovered and openly addressed in healthcare professional's education programs. This review highlights these three types of bias and their interrelationships with the aim of revealing hidden truths in the education of healthcare professionals. Ultimately, we offer targeted recommendations of focus for programs to address implicit bias within their curricula.",

            "text": "Because BIPOC Americans may have greater access to primary care clinicians than palliative care specialists, it is important that these clinicians develop culturally responsive primary palliative care skills and abilities (e.g. basic symptom management and communication skills). Primary palliative care as an educational concept should be a part of all healthcare professionals' curricula as a set of culturally responsive skills and competencies that respect beliefs and values of BIPOC older adults with serious illness. Integrating these concepts into the generalist curriculum provides an opportunity to infuse these programs with greater opportunities to practice comprehensive/ holistic care to a variety of diverse patients/caregivers. These concepts will also support future clinicians' ability to support and engage with older adults with serious illness in a manner free of bias. This article describes how modern healthcare professional education programs perpetuate ageist, racist, and gender-biased overtones through student/faculty recruitment and student training. Because of this deficient foundational launch, we see that seriously ill older adult BIPOC are at risk of receiving biased care throughout the illness experience. Our goal is to uncover ageist, racist, and gender-based biases in professional education as a targeted first step to enact change at the foundational level of professional development. We propose how incorporating palliative care concepts and understanding healthcare professional organizations' focus on addressing biases with practicing clinicians can offer these training programs opportunities for reflection. We conclude with suggestions to address how health professional education programs can create change and reenvision care that meets the complex needs of BIPOC older adults.",

            "text": "Demographics. Current estimates project that by 2050, most of the U.S. population will be comprised of racial and ethnic minorities. Despite this, minorities continue to be underrepresented in many health professional education programs (e.g. Physical therapy, Physician, Registered Nursing) [9] . While efforts to diversify healthcare have been of focus, the 2004 Sullivan Commission on Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce reported that people of color found gaining admission to health professional programs complicated [10] . This heightened focus on recruiting BIPOC students is due, in part, to research demonstrating that patient adherence with medical recommendations is greater when provided by clinicians with similar cultural backgrounds [10, 11] . Despite these positive findings, in 2018 only 5.5% of the total Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) resident/fellow population identified as Black and 7.8% as Hispanic [11] . This is much lower than the proportion of Blacks and Hispanics in the U.S. population (13.4% and 18.3%, respectively) [11] . Consistent with other medical subspecialties, only 7.6% of resident physicians training in geriatrics identified as Black and 11.5% identified as Hispanic, compared to 45.4% who identified as White. [12] Similarly, the nursing profession continues to lack diversity. As of 2019, 90% of registered nurses were women and 81% were white. [13] Perceptions. Students bring their own thoughts and beliefs about aging into their health professional program, and these attitudes sometimes shift during training. A systematic review of 24 studies with undergraduate nursing students, reported that those students ranked gerontological nursing relatively low as a field of interest [14] . Factors underlying this ranking included attitudes toward geriatrics, clinical practice environment, prior experience working with older adults, lived experience with older family members, and anxiety about aging [14] . Conversely, students from graduate nursing and physical therapy programs reported more positive attitudes toward the older adult population when compared to all other health professional students [15] . These differences were not explained by student's demographic variables, exposure through clinical education, or interest in primary care practice serving older adults [15] . This seems to suggest that physical therapy and graduate nursing programs positively influence their student's attitudes towards aging by displaying an appreciation of the challenges and rewards that accompany caring for the aging population [15] .",

A study examining the implicit gender bias of educators found that in the emergency room, 60% of medical faculty associated medical/science fields with the male gender [18] .

For instance, the amount of time dedicated to teaching geriatric medicine is disproportionately low compared with the time spent providing medical care for older adults. For example, the ACGME only recently mandated that generalist physicians have training specifically in geriatrics, whereas Pediatrics was recognized as a specialty many decades ago. In fact, the first formal US medical school course in studying the diseases of children dates back to the early 1800s, the origin of Geriatrics dates back only to the 1950s in England [19] . U.S. Internal Medicine resident training programs only began to require a 4-week course in geriatric medicine within the last decade. [20] . In contrast to medical schools, many schools of nursing have removed geriatrics as a specialty and instead integrate it throughout the curriculum as part of adult health [21] . This integration increases the risk that the subject matter is deemphasized throughout the curriculum and its uniqueness can get lost along the way.",

One way this is being addressed is through the inclusion of content on structural racism, bias, and gender equity in national professional society meetings. The American Geriatrics Society (AGS), the Annual Assembly of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM), and the American College of Physicians (ACP) all included keynote plenary speakers on diversity, microaggression, and related topics for their virtual 2021 annual meetings. AAHPM offers an annual advanced leadership course entitled \"ASCEND\" which was offers content on actionable leadership amidst social injustice.

Publications such as the \"Doorway Thoughts\" series explores issues and concerns regarding the beliefs, traditions, and customs that would apply to clinical encounters with an older adult from 15 different groups of diverse ethnic backgrounds. This series is presently being translated into other languages and into multiple formats for specific cultural groups including Hispanic and African American/ Black older adults. The series focuses on topics relevant to intercultural care, including health literacy, approaches to clinician education, and the interface between spirituality and health decision-making. The AGS also introduced 2 separate webinars in late 2020, hosting a multidisciplinary panel to raise awareness and position action toward racial bias in health care. AGS leadership recently integrated a statement into its revised mission and goals articulating its vision that health care will be free of discrimination and bias along with strategic priorities for meeting that vision. Aligned with that vision is a paper series targeted for publication in 2021 in the Journal of the American Geriatric Society (JAGS), aimed to define the current intersection of structural racism and aging led by members of the AGS Ethics and Public Policy Committees along with several others. The series will also include a comprehensive plan to ensure diversity in research, such that by 2031, 100% of original research published in JAGS or presented at the AGS Annual Scientific Meeting will take full account of ethnicity, gender, disability, age, and sexual orientation in its design, undertaking, and reporting.",

Integrating palliative care into healthcare professional training improves education by emphasizing the diversity of patient and caregiver experience with serious illness. These fundamental concepts are about treating patients as whole persons-addressing physical, emotional, social, and spiritual concerns-within the context of care provided by family, friends, and communities. It is about meeting patients and caregivers where they are, clarifying what is most important to them, and then tailoring medical care to align with those values and preferences. Patients become persons, not just diagnoses or stereotyped illness scripts. This is a shift from provider-to patient/caregiver-centered care with shared decision-making that is informed by patient goals and concerns. Improving quality of life requires exploring all areas of suffering, not just the physical symptoms brought on by a particular illness but also the suffering that comes from years of discrimination and distrust of healthcare providers. Student and Faculty Representation. Since the Sullivan report [46] , many strategies were implemented with the intention of increasing the recruitment and retention of BIPOC students and faculty. Despite these efforts, substantial increases in diversity have not happened [10] . Bonini & Matias argue that the \"pervasiveness of whiteness\" in health profession education is the larger issue that must be addressed first. For example, in nursing education whiteness is normalized as the culture to which others are compared. Further, nurse educators often lack anti-racist competencies [10, 11] . This manifests itself when programs seek to recruit diverse students yet lack the systems in place to support them in predominantly White spaces [47, 48] .",

This reflective work will provide the necessary first steps to build a responsive and active curriculum designed to challenge ageist, racist, and sexist attitudes (see Fig. 1 ). Health professional programs should be supportive environments with diverse faculty and students working diligently to assess and mitigate the biases they hold. We trust that when healthcare professionals' education programs embrace these steps to engage in change, care will improve as BIPOC will be better understood and ultimately, as older adults, will receive care that is responsive and respectful of their beliefs and values.
