While all United States cities have been the traditional homelands of AI/AN peoples since time immemorial, urban AI/ANs are consistently excluded in local and national health assessments, including recent reports pertaining to COVID-19. Today the majority of AI/ ANs (71%) live in urban areas, and many cities have strong Urban Indian Health Programs (UIHPs) that provide space for medical care, community gatherings, cultural activities, and traditional healing. Many of these UIHPs are currently scrambling to meet the needs of their AI/AN service communities during the pandemic. While the COVID-19 pandemic brought new sources of funding to UIHPs, the lack of local AI/AN data and arbitrary funding restrictions precluded some UIHPs from addressing their communities' most immediate challenges such as food and economic insecurities. Despite these challenges, urban AI/AN communities carry the historical resilience of their ancestors as they weave strong community networks, establish contemporary traditions, and innovate to meet community needs. This article focuses on the experiences of one UIHP in Baltimore City during the COVID-19 pandemic to illustrate present-day challenges and strengths, as well as illuminate the urgency for tailored, local data-driven public health approaches to urban AI/AN health.",

            "text": "All United States cities are located on ancestral and contemporary Indigenous homelands and bear complex histories regarding American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) peoples and settler colonialism (Furlan, 2017) . While some cities have made strides toward acknowledging harmful colonial histories, few adequately recognize the enduring presence and needs of urban AI/ANs in their cities (Furlan, 2017) . Although many AI/ANs have lived in urban areas since long before the 1950s, the relocation period of the 1950s marked an important population shift, as well as a shift in perceptions of American Indian identities (Furlan, 2017) . As a result of federal relocation programs enacted in the 1950s and inadequate economic and educational opportunities in their home communities, many AI/AN families have lived in urban areas for generations (Venables, 2004; Rhoades et al., 2005) . In the World War II era, approximately 40,000 AI/ANs moved to urban areas to find jobs in the then booming war industries (Weaver, 2012) . In 1956, the United States federal government passed the Indian Relocation Act to encourage AI/ANs to move to urban areas with the goal of assimilating them into the general population and reducing the federal government's trust responsibilities to Native peoples (Madigan, 1956) . These trust responsibilities included honoring treaty rights to healthcare and education in perpetuity in exchange for land (Madigan, 1956) . The former Commissioner of Indian Affairs claimed that the goal of relocation was harmonious with the federal Indian termination policies aimed to assimilate AI/ANs into the United States (Fixico, 2000) . While this policy was effective in moving AI/ANs to urban areas, promises for housing, and employment made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs were never fulfilled (Furlan, 2017) . In the words of one Bureau of Indian Affairs official, they were purposely given a \"one-way ticket\" from reservation to urban poverty (Furlan 2017; Nesterak 2019) .",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that certain underlying medical conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, put individuals at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a). Nationally AI/ANs are disproportionately affected by these conditions (Cobb et al., 2014; Hutchinson and Shin, 2014; Indian Health Service, 2019) . CDC data show that AI/ANs are 3.5 times more likely to contract COVID-19 and to be hospitalized than non-Hispanic Whites in the United States (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b; Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020c; Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020d; Hatcher et al., 2020) . Additionally, the age adjusted mortality rate for COVID-19 was 1.8 times higher in AI/ANs than in non-Hispanic Whites (Arrazola et al., 2020) . As with all races, COVID-19 mortality rates appear to be increasing with age for AI/AN peoples, but the largest mortality disparity between AI/ANs and non-Hispanic whites is in the age group of 20-49 years (Arrazola et al., 2020) . COVID-19 mortality rates by both sexes for AI/ANs are 1.8 times that of non-Hispanic Whites of the respective sex (Arrazola et al., 2020) . Additional considerations for AI/ANs that may increase risk for COVID-19 include; historical medical mistreatment that may make AI/AN individuals reluctant to seek care, high levels of perceived discrimination in healthcare, and that nationally nearly onethird of AI/ANs under 65 years of age do not have health insurance (Burgess et al., 2008; Findling et al., 2019 ; Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020e). When combined with high levels of poverty, multigenerational and crowded housing, and inadequate funding of UIHPs, the risk of contracting COVID-19 intensified for urban AI/ANs (Moore et al., 2020) . Additional pandemic complications, such as mass lay-offs and food and sanitary supply shortages, exacerbated conditions. In the early stages of the pandemic, many people (especially people of color) lost their jobs and were left without the financial means to afford housing bills (Kantamneni, 2020; Watson et al., 2020) . While many UIHPs received COVID-19 federal funding, restrictions on how the funding could be spent (i.e., restrictions on direct support for food, housing or utility assistance) precluded UIHPs from meeting community members' most immediate needs for food, rent and utility assistance. The disconnect between the policies that created these restrictions and the community members' survival needs signify the importance of critically examining whose interests these restrictions serve: the federal government's or AI/AN peoples?",

Despite failed government policies and inadequate health and social services, Native peoples have found each other in cities and built strong communities-often with added identity beyond tribal citizenship which includes proudly adding \"urban Indian\" to one's tribal identity (Fixico, 2000) . Since time immemorial, Baltimore City and the surrounding areas have been the ancestral lands of the Piscataway and Susquehannock peoples (Maryland State Archives, n.d.). Due to relocation policies and growing urbanization, Baltimore City and the six surrounding counties are now home to a strong community of over 25,000 urban AI/ANs, representing many tribal affiliations, with a notable presence from the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2018; Minner, 2019). Native American LifeLines (NAL) is a leading urban AI/AN health service center, established in 2000 as a 501c3 non-profit organization and Title V IHS contracted UIHP that serves Baltimore and surrounding counties (Native American LifeLines, n.d.-a). NAL employs seven staff representing six tribes and two allies who provide behavioral health and substance use counseling, medical case management and referrals, dental care, health promotion, and cultural programming to AI/AN community members (Native American Lifelines, n.d.-b).",

Many AI/AN Baltimoreans live in disadvantaged areas where primarily nutrient poor, calorically dense foods are accessible at local convenience stores. Many do not own vehicles or have funds to utilize private ride sharing options to travel to grocery stores outside of their neighborhoods. Thus, during the pandemic, Baltimore AI/ANs are faced with a lesser-of-two-evils dilemma: to access poor quality foods through corner or dollar stores in their immediate neighborhoods or risk contracting COVID-19 by using public transportation to travel to grocery stores.",

The sudden media attention around this action drew the attention of the district's City Councilman, who had a prior relationship with NAL. This Frontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org February 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 611775 councilman met with a local Indigenous activist group (including NAL staff) to ask how he could support the local AI/AN community during the pandemic. The Indigenous activist group cited lack of health data as a critical issue for Baltimore AI/AN. As a result of this meeting, the Councilman wrote a letter to the Baltimore City Health Department requesting they update COVID-19 racial classification categories to include AI/AN. Since then, the City has started to \"report\" AI/AN data, although it is unclear if the Baltimore City Health Department is now reporting the data for AI/AN peoples from the beginning of the pandemic or if the current available AI/AN only represents testing and cases since updating the racial categories for COVID-19 data. This lack of clarity is concerning as NAL is unable to discern if there has been a spike in AI/AN testing and cases, or if delayed testing numbers are just now being reported. Nonetheless, in the earliest stages of the pandemic, NAL was left without the proper data to document the rates of COVID-19 testing and infection of their service population and was forced to rely on anecdotal evidence to justify needs to funders and policymakers. Accurate, real-time data are vital for UIHPs to respond to local needs with programs and interventions that match community priorities.",

            "text": "Regarding racial misclassification, federal, local, and state health departments should move beyond simple consultation with local UIHPs and instead form meaningful collaborations to provide data and resources to UIHPs. This will enhance UIHPs' ability to serve their urban communities. It is also imperative that mainstream health departments and entities recognize that their views of health equity are built on Western epistemologies (Echo-Hawk, 2019). Indigenous peoples remain particularly invisible in urban landscapes and the unique intergenerational effects of previous pandemics, forced relocation, historical trauma, and cultural genocide that they have experienced are largely ignored (Brave Heart and DeBruyn, 1998; Duran et al., 1998; Brave Heart et al., 2011) . One of the most essential ways mainstream health entities can support UIHPs to achieve Indigenous health equity is by critically evaluating and revising their data collection practices in true partnership with local UIHPs. The UIHI offers concrete recommendations for revising data collection measures and analyzing data in a way that honors tribal data sovereignty (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020). An important initial step includes creating and enforcing mandates for collection of race and ethnicity in health data that utilize local, state, and federal funds (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020). Data collection and analyses should consider allowing for multi-racial identities, as AI/AN peoples are one of the largest growing multiracial groups in the United States (Norris et al., 2012) . This can be achieved by defining AI/AN populations as inclusively as possible during analyses by using AI/AN in combination with one or more races (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020). Weighted sampling and oversampling of AI/AN populations should be utilized to ensure that \"invisible\" populations are still counted, and their data is available (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020). When reporting data, it is recommended to avoid using \"multi-racial\" or \"other\" as categories, instead consider breaking into AI/AN alone, and AI/AN in combination with one or more races (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020). Using categories like \"other\" or \"multi-racial\" rarely yield meaningful results, for example, Baltimore City COVID-19 data was originally reported as African American, White, Asian, and Other (Miller, 2020) . This sort of categorization led to confusion about whether or not AI/AN data was being collected at all, if AI/AN data was lumped into the other category, or what happened to the data of those who identified as multi-racial. Lastly, reporting strengths-based and positive outcomes helps to highlight the many successful health initiatives and innovations of AI/AN communities (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020). While these general recommendations serve as a starting point, they do not replace direct and meaningful collaboration with local UIHPs. Each urban AI/AN community holds unique health challenges and strengths, and data priorities vary greatly from community to community.",

Yet, these rights are not fully realized by AI/ANs who move to urban areas, as most Indian Health Service full ambulatory clinics and hospitals are located on reservation lands (Urban Indian Health Commission, 2007). To meet the needs of urban AI/ANs, the Indian Health Service (IHS) provides contracts and grants to 41 Urban Indian Health programs (UIHPs) (Indian Health Service, 2018). Despite the efforts of these programs, the Urban Indian Health Institute (UIHI) had documented that lack of adequate health services are a serious problem for most urban AI/AN families (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2004). On average, UIHPs receive approximately half of their funding from IHS while the remainder of their funding is composed of federal health grants, state contracts, and foundation grants (National Council of Urban Indian Health, n.d.-a). Urban AI/ ANs experience the same health issues as AI/ANs nationwide, but these problems are exacerbated due to reduced access to Native-specific resources for health, social support, and cultural",
