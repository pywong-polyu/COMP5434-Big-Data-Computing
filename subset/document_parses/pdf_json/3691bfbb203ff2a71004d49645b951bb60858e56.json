In addition to the ongoing research and development of vaccines, there is still a dire need for safe and effective drugs for the control and treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Numerous repurposed drugs are under clinical investigations whose reported adverse events can raise worries about their safety. The aim of this review is to illuminate the associated adverse events related to the drugs used in a real COVID-19 setting along with their relevant mechanism(s). Method Through a literature search conducted on PubMed and Google Scholar database, various adverse events suspected to be induced by eight drugs, including dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ ritonavir, ivermectin, and tocilizumab, administered in COVID-19 patients in clinical practice and studies were identified in 30 case reports, 3 case series, and 10 randomized clinical trials. Results Mild, moderate, or severe adverse events of numerous repurposed and investigational drugs caused by various factors and mechanisms were observed. Gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting were the most frequently followed by cardiovascular, cutaneous, and hepatic adverse events. Few other rare adverse drug reactions were also observed. Conclusion In light of their ineffectiveness against COVID-19 as evident in large clinical studies, drugs including hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ivermectin should neither be used routinely nor in clinical studies. While lack of sufficient data, it creates doubt regarding the reliability of chloroquine and favipiravir use in COVID-19 patients. Hence, these two drugs can only be used in clinical studies. In contrast, ample well-conducted studies have approved the use of remdesivir, tocilizumab, and dexamethasone under certain conditions in COVID-19 patients. Consequently, it is significant to establish a strong surveillance system in order to monitor the proper safety and toxicity profile of the potential anti-COVID-19 drugs with good clinical outcomes.",

            "text": "The world is experiencing one of its most turbulent times with the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic. First identified in Wuhan city of Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, the deadly virus has spread across the countries and affected countless [1] . According to World Health Organization (WHO), as of 14 June 2021, there have been 75,541,600 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients confirmed so far, of which there are 3,798,361 deaths, globally. On 9 June 2021, WHO declared that a total of 2,156,550,767 vaccine doses have been administered [2] . Therefore, although society and researchers at large have successfully worked towards the development of several vaccines, there still exists a need to discover safe and effective, potential drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19, especially for patients exhibiting critical clinical symptoms. One efficient and economic approach to identifying promising therapeutic drugs is drug repurposing, which refers to the repositioning or reprofiling of existing medications against viruses, malaria, cancer, and arthritis for a new indication, in this case for COVID-19 [3] . A convenient method utilizing already available drugs with known mechanism, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, efficacy, and toxicity profiles leads to low cost and less time consumption for drug development [3, 4] . However, in urgency for early and immediate effective treatments, less consideration has been given to their safety in terms of its associated adverse events. Though the significant investigation of adverse events is lacking, reports from existing studies suggest gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, dermatological, and liver symptoms to be some of the common adverse drug reactions among many others in patients after receiving antiviral therapy for COVID-19 [5] . Causality assessment to determine the exact cause of effects is a big challenge owing to the interweaving contributing, confounding risk factors, and incomplete data or background of the event [6] . Thus, strengthened surveillance of therapeutics and its potentially harmful adverse effects or pharmacovigilance is the need of the hour for better management of COVID-19 therapies.",

Primarily, its potential to cause serious QT interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. The mechanism suggested to induce such effects was the inhibitory action on the hyperpolarized cardiac channels that resulted in the delay of depolarization rate and eventually decreased heart rate [13] . As shown in several case reports and case series, coadministration of HCQ with QT prolonging medications like azithromycin may increase the risk of cardiac toxicity among many other factors including age, sex, duration of therapy, hepatic or renal failure, and pre-existing cardiovascular disease [13, 20] . In a case report by Asli et al., patient was administrated with lopinavir/ritonavir, another QTc prolonging agent concomitantly with HCQ that might have contributed to the cause of right bundle branch block (RBBB) and severe QTc interval prolongation [19] . Another such case of an 84-year-old woman with history of hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) suggested the close relation of HCQ with sinus bradycardia and QTc prolongation. The QTc levels normalized after discontinuation of drug along with intravenous administration of isoproterenol and epinephrine [15] . In most of the studies, patient QTc intervals and symptoms improved soon after discontinuation of the drug. Consequently, it is advocated that a baseline ECG should be defined for patients who are planned to begin treatment with HCQ [12] .",

Following the diagnosis of adverse reaction, HCQ was substituted with lopinavir/ritonavir, and the patient was initiated with 10 mg of loratadine twice daily and 50 mg of diphenhydramine thrice daily for treatment. The patient was discharged from the hospital 5 days later [16] . In the third case report by Delaleu et al.

Although the mechanism of psychiatric adverse effects remains ambiguous, the authors hypothesized the effect of chloroquine on muscarinic, dopaminergic pathways alongside its antagonistic activity on 5-HT3A, 5-HT3B, and GABA receptors and agonistic action on NMDA receptors to be the trigger of such psychiatric symptoms [27] .",

Though patients were also treated with other known cardiotoxic drugs, this further supported the suspicion of remdesivir being the causative agent. Additionally, according to the Naranjo scale, one patient was given a score of 6 implying a \"probable\" causal relationship between remdesivir and bradycardia [29] . With regard to the first case, one possible reason can be the co-administrated drug, azithromycin, which is a QT prolonging agent. A probable mechanism behind the AE can also be the strong affinity of remdesivir for human mitochondrial RNA-polymerase, causing mitochondrial dysfunction [33] . Another can be the likeness of nucleotide triphosphate derivative, an active remdesivir metabolite to ATP leading to delayed sinoatrial node spontaneous depolarization [65] . Nevertheless, less evidence is available regarding the potential cardiac-related side effects of remdesivir and more research is needed to determine its possible mechanisms of action.",

Leegwater et al. [31] recently reported a case of a 64-year-old man who experienced acute increased levels of ALT and AST after starting remdesivir. Remarkably, a quick fall in the ALT and AST levels were observed after immediate cessation of the drug. The authors hypothesized the drug-drug interaction between remdesivir, P-glycoprotein inhibitors as a potential cause of hepatotoxicity in the patient. Another factor for hepatotoxicity can be the temporarily administered 700 mg of amiodarone, given 2 days after the initiation of remdesivir for new onset atrial fibrillation, since many studies depict its potential for hepatotoxicity [66, 67] . So again drug-drug interaction leading to potentiating effect could be the reason for observed hepatotoxicity. Similarly, Carothers and colleagues published a case series of two patients describing the onset of elevated ALT and AST levels followed by acute liver failure after receiving remdesivir treatment for coronavirus disease 2019. In both cases, instant withdrawal of the drug and administration of acetylcysteine restored the ALT and AST levels to normal [34] . Likewise, it is advised by Aleen et al. to consider stopping remdesivir infusions when de novo increase in liver enzymes values is more than tenfold the upper limit of normal [68] .",

The remdesivir patient group received a loading dose of 200 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg daily. In comparison, it was found that adverse events such as nausea, hypokalaemia, and headache were more frequent in the remdesivir group as compared to standard care that comprised of more serious adverse events [35] .

Developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, it was introduced in Japan in 2014 for therapeutic use in pandemic influenza A and B virus-infected patients [69, 70] . Similar to remdesivir, it works against a wide range of viruses such as influenza virus, ebolavirus, flavivirus, arenavirus, and coronavirus. It exhibits antiviral activity after entering into the host human cell [71] . Following entry, favipiravir becomes activated to form favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5\u02b9-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP) after undergoing intracellular phosphoribosylation and phosphorylation. This activated molecule replaces the purine nucleosides and acts as a substrate for the RdRp enzyme further inhibiting the RdRp enzyme and preventing viral RNA strand elongation and protein synthesis. Additionally, lethal mutagenesis as a result of favipiravir-RTP incorporation into nascent RNA is a possible mechanism of action to stop viral infection [69, 71] . In June 2020, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd received approval from Indian regulatory authorities to manufacture and market oral favipiravir medication under the trade name \"FabiFlu\" for the use in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients [72] . However, to determine the adverse events safety outcome of favipiravir administration, it is still undergoing many clinical trials and clinical studies to deem its use as completely safe and effective.",

IL-6 has an essential function in mobilizing free fatty acids through adipocytes and stimulating glucose and free fatty acid uptake from serum by skeletal muscles. Similar findings were observed in two cases where patients exhibited a peak increase in serum TG levels after TCZ treatment for acute severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale gave a score of 7, denoting a probable relationship between hypertriglyceridemia and tocilizumab. According to Morrison et al.

To begin with, the number of case reports, case series, and random clinical trials describing the relation of adverse effects to antiviral COVID-19 therapy is inadequate. Due to this, the results of this review should be understood cautiously. This may be because only publications in the English language were incorporated and unpublished literature was not investigated. Underreporting of adverse effects may be another reason for less available evidence. Additionally, these are often a subject of bias with the information obtained from them being incomplete, or incorrect, and resulting in selective reporting and possible publication bias.",

Although most are self-limiting and mild to moderate in severity, these can be severe or life-threatening events with confounding factors that demand immediate attention either necessitating prompt discontinuation of the suspected drug or administration of counter medication. Large clinical studies, including the SOLIDARITY and DisCoVeRy trials, have demonstrated the ineffectiveness of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ivermectin on the grounds of overall mortality, duration of hospital stay, initiation of ventilation, and dissuading their administration in COVID-19 patients. These drugs should neither be used as routine medication nor in the case of clinical studies. But for drugs including remdesivir, tocilizumab, and dexamethasone, there are enough, sufficiently powered, positive studies that have recommended their use in the case of patients in specific critical conditions or special circumstances [11, 94, 95] . Studies proving the effectiveness of chloroquine or favipiravir, however, are still inconclusive. And since the data is insufficient to form a reliable conclusion, presently, these drugs should be used in clinical studies only.",

And while the majority of the observed reports propose the causal relationship of COVID-19 drugs and their adverse effects as \"probable,\" there are several other factors that can affect the safety and effectiveness of a drug. Concomitant medications with their own propensity to induce the adverse effects or drug-drug interactions being two such major factors. Furthermore, vigilant drug monitoring and prompt reporting of any adverse effects are recommended for quick counter interventions to be undertaken. Thus, to gain a greater comprehension of adverse events, their mechanisms, and other potential risk factors, more research and clinical studies into drug-adverse event causality relationship and epidemiology are necessary.",
