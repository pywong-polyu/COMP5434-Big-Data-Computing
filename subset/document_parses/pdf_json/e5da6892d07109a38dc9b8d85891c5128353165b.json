ATR is a common FTIR sampling technique as it does not require samples to be placed in KBr pellets or pretreated. Alternatively, the sample was measured by constructing direct contact with the crystal surface to obtain spectroscopic data. ATR-FTIR was used to determine the polymorphic content of bulk pharmaceutical materials and powder mixtures, and adulteration [14, 15] .

This process enabled the detection of differences in the sample spectra, allowing counterfeit medicine identification. The ATR-FTIR spectra of the counterfeit (A1, B1 and C1) plastic blister samples and the authentic plastic blister samples displayed very similar characteristics (Figure 1) . A further comparison between the authentic and counterfeit samples indicated that both characteristics' peaks stemmed from a particular polymer compound and the regions of spectral overlap (Figures 2-4) . Table 2 presents the polymer spectra of the counterfeit and authentic samples. were all forged from the same polymer material and claimed to be the authentic blister pack samples. Figure 2 shows typical ATR-FTIR spectra of blister packaging of samples of authentic A and counterfeit A1. The main bands identified in the ATR-FTIR spectra are as follows: 609 cm \u22121 and 679-681 cm \u22121 due to C-Cl bond stretching [27] ; 964 cm \u22121 : rocking of CH 2 group; 1251-1252 cm \u22121 : C-H bending; 1328-1330 cm \u22121 and 1426 cm \u22121 : CH 2 bending. These results suggest the presence of PVC in the chemical composition of the forming polymer of the blister packaging. Generally, a similar chemical profile of ATR-FTIR spectra was observed between Samples A and A1. Figure 3 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of blister packaging for authentic B and counterfeit B1 samples. The ATR-FTIR spectra identified are as follows: 523-524 cm \u22121 , 610-612 cm \u22121 and 697 cm \u22121 : C-Cl stretching; 964 cm \u22121 : rocking of CH 2 group; 1096 cm \u22121 : C-C stretching bond of the PVC backbone chain; 1252 cm \u22121 : C-H bending corresponding to Cl group; 1330 and 1426 cm \u22121 : CH 2 bending [28] . Similar to Figure 2 , these results also suggest the presence of PVC in both Samples B and B1. Figure 4 also shows similar ATR-FTIR spectra between Samples C and C1. The spectra for the authentic and counterfeit samples are as follows: 518-523 cm \u22121 , 610-612 cm \u22121 and 694-698 cm \u22121 : correspondence to C-Cl bond stretching; 962-964 cm \u22121 : rocking of CH 2 group; 1096 cm \u22121 : back bone chain of C-C stretching [29] ; 1252 cm \u22121 : CH bending; 1328-1330 cm \u22121 and 1426 cm \u22121 : CH 2 bending. PVC was also present in samples C and C1 as similar chemical profiles were identified between these samples. Further comparison with the spectral library revealed that the polymer used in the production of both plastic blisters was polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The spectra showed that the counterfeit samples were all forged from the same polymer material and claimed to be the authentic blister pack samples.",

The polymer from Sample B, an authentic product, had a lower melting and exothermic peak than B1. It melted at 239.92 \u00b1 1.06 \u2022 C and also showed a distinct exothermic peak at 287.41 \u00b1 12.59 \u2022 C. The DSC thermogram for Sample B1 plastic blisters also consisted of two peaks, but the melting point was at 265.48 \u00b1 2.34 \u2022 C, and the exothermic peak was at 299.13 \u00b1 3.88 \u2022 C. These results specified a different polymer melting point between Samples B and B1. Samples C and C1, which are counterfeit and original sildenafil plastics, respectively, consisted of two peaks with a similar pattern. Nevertheless, the original sildenafil plastic exhibited two peaks, which were the polymer melting at 271.45 \u00b1 2.12 \u2022 C and a distinct exothermic peak at 294.05 \u00b1 5.78 \u2022 C (Figure 7) . The DSC thermogram for the counterfeit sample plastic blisters (Sample C) also consisted of two peaks but at a higher temperature, 281.23 \u00b1 1.68 \u2022 C for the melting point and an exothermic peak at 299.8 \u00b1 1.67 \u2022 C. These results further suggest that the polymer used in the Sample C blister pack was different from the polymer used in counterfeit Sample C1. The onset, peak, end of melting and enthalpy change in fusion (\u2206H) for the DSC analysis are presented in Table 3 . (Figure 7) . The DSC thermogram for the counterfeit sample plastic blisters (Sample C) also consisted of two peaks but at a higher temperature, 281.23 \u00b1 1.68 \u00b0C for the melting point and an exothermic peak at 299.8 \u00b1 1.67 \u00b0C. These results further suggest that the polymer used in the Sample C blister pack was different from the polymer used in counterfeit Sample C1.

The onset, peak, end of melting and enthalpy change in fusion (\u2206H) for the DSC analysis are presented in Table 3 . All polymers from the pharmaceutical samples were identified by FTIR analysis, and the spectral library revealed that the polymer used in the production of plastic blisters in all samples was polyvinyl chloride (PVC). DSC has the upper hand in understanding the crystallinity and melting point of a polymer, which is particularly valuable, since PVC has a broad melting point [30] . Even though the same polymer was submitted to the DSC analysis, it was able to distinguish between both polymers using their melting point, heat of fusion and crystallization point. PVC is also recognized to have the ability to essentially adjust its elasticity and hardness through the addition of a plasticizer [31] , which makes it possible to alter the melting point of the blister. The counterfeiter may use PVC with a different compatibilizer in their product [32] .

Hence, it can be concluded that another quality of PVC was used to produce the counterfeit pharmaceutical plastic blisters, obtainable from a different supplier or by using a compatibilizer that is different from the legitimate manufacturer of the authentic medicine [33] . As demonstrated in this study, DSC allows differentiating between different qualities of PVC solely based on their thermal transitions, despite having a similar FTIR spectrum. Changes such as curing and crystallization may reveal the difference in the manufacturing processes by different manufacturers. Different polymers, such as polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE), were also easily distinguishable based on their melting point using DSC [34] , even though the FTIR spectrum exhibited a similar blueprint. Moreover, DSC excels in terms of observation of the thermal transitions of a polymer blend. FTIR analysis, on the other hand, requires trained personnel to interpret the result. It focused on identifying characteristic spectral bands with the analysis of the registered spectra to identify the functional groups of active compounds introduced to the polymer material.",

            "text": "This work substantiated that ATR-FTIR and DSC are powerful analytical tools for polymer identification. The ability of ATR-FTIR to characterize the polymer used to discern between authentic and counterfeit samples shows some limitations if a polymer with the same chemical compound is used in the packaging materials. DSC demonstrated its ability to quickly detect fake products by differentiating the polymers' melting points in both samples. DSC allowed us to distinguish between different PVC qualities based on their thermal transitions, despite having a similar FTIR spectrum. Conducting a forensic analysis on the polymer material using FTIR and DSC ensures vital information reaches the relevant authorities, who will pursue this in a continuous attempt to scrutinize counterfeit medicinal product sources. Identifying various substances can provide leads for investigators who can subsequently confirm or refute their suspicions. Finally, the data of this study established that counterfeit medicine could be detected by analyzing the polymer materials in the packaging. This will provide aid to law enforcement as well as other members of the criminal justice and legal systems, with the intention to successfully investigate and adjudicate these crimes.",
