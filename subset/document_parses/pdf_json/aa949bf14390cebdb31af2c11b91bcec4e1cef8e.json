            "text": "The application of oxygen with various devices is a common therapeutic strategy in preclinical and clinical emergency medicine. In some emergencies, such as smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication and decompression illness (DCI), arterial oxygen partial pressures (pO2) far beyond physiological values are needed as life-saving acute treatment (Brubakk and Neumann, 2002; Eichhorn et al., 2018; Juttner et al., 2021) . CO intoxication is a common problem worldwide, either in form of smoke poisoning or in form of a solitary intoxication. The clinical symptoms are highly variable and range from headache over alterations in mental status to coma. Compared to oxygen, CO has a 200-300 times higher affinity to hemoglobin and other heme-containing enzymes like myoglobin and cytochrome-c oxidase (Rose et al., 2017) . Hence, inhaled CO displaces oxygen from these enzymes and blocks oxygen transport and the respiratory chain (Weaver, 1999; Weaver, 2009) . This results in a variety of complications including tissue hypoxia as well as myocardial and cerebral damage (Weaver, 1999) . Tissue damage can be significantly reduced by eliminating CO from hemecontaining enzymes as fast as possible. The most important emergency intervention is the immediate application of pure oxygen, very often as a bridging therapy until a hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy can be organized (Juttner et al., 2021) . Normobaric administration of 100% oxygen reduces the CO dissociation half-life from 320 min to approx. 74 min (Ernst and Zibrak, 1998; Weaver et al., 2000) HBO therapy at 3 bar reduces carboxyhemoglobin half-life even further to about 23 min (Pace et al., 1950; Peterson and Stewart, 1970; Jay and McKindley, 1997) and can improve the neurological outcome. HBO therapy also increases the physically dissolved oxygen in the blood which may compensate the hypoxia caused by COhemoglobin compounds (Weaver, 1999) .",

DCI is caused by bubble formation from dissolved inert gas during a compressed gas dive. These bubbles may develop because of supersaturation due to a too fast pressure drop when ascending. Depending on size, number and location, these emboli can cause subclinical to life-threatening damage in all kind of tissues and organ systems (Vann et al., 2011; Hartig et al., 2020) . Breathing pure oxygen is the most important and effective therapy, because oxygen not only dissolves the bubbles, but also compensates the hypoxia in affected tissues (Longphre et al., 2007; Mitchell et al., 2018a) . Thus, HBO therapy in a pressure chamber with ambient pressures up to 2.8 bar is the standard treatment for DCI (Brubakk and Neumann, 2002) .",

With increasing arterial pO2, inert gas bubbles dissolve and O2 replaces CO in heme-containing enzymes. Furthermore, the increase of physically dissolved oxygen in the blood improves tissue oxygenation (Weaver, 1999; Ortega et al., 2021) . As HBO treatment is only available in specialized centres, arterial pO2 must be increased as much as possible using normobaric modalities during first aid, primary and secondary transport (Eichhorn et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2018a; Mitchell et al., 2018b; Juttner et al., 2021) . In this study, we investigated eight oxygen systems for their ability to increase arterial pO2 and their comfort. Beside common systems, we also included the SuperNO 2 VA nasal PAP device and the Flow-Safe II CPAP device as they are used with constant low flow oxygen, do not need power supply or highly skilled providers and are therefore particularly suitable for a prehospital setting. A standard diving regulator operated with pure oxygen and the SuperNO 2 VA mask used with constant flow oxygen at a rate of 15 L/min achieved comparable arterial pO2 as nasal high-flow and the gold standard NPPV. The SuperNO 2 VA is a nasal PAP system that was initially developed to stent open the upper airway in a preoperative setting. Mean arterial pO2 was >500 mm Hg with these devices and the increase of pO2 was rapid with near maximum values reached within 1 minute. The other systems, including a standard nasal cannula and a standard nonrebreather mask, were less effective. According to the alveolar gas equation, the maximal theoretically attainable arterial pO2 under 100% normobaric oxygen is about 660 mm Hg at sea level and about 612 mm Hg at our localisation, which is 570 m above sea level. Due to the alveolar-arterial drop, physiological shunts, V/Q ratio, exhaled pN2 and pCO2, the pO2 values realizable in practice are about 500-550 mmHg. Therefore, the oxygenation performance of the best devices in our study was within the theoretically achievable maximum and even endotracheal intubation would not improve these results.",

At many diving sites, scuba tanks with pure oxygen are available. In case of DCI, it may be more effective to use a standard diving regulator operated with pure oxygen than a nasal cannula or nonrebreather mask, which are usually applied by first responders for primary care and transport to hospital. NPPV and nasal highflow devices are limited for primary care and transport as devices are complex requiring a trained physician or the devices are not portable without constant power supply. Hence, the SuperNO 2 VA, which is easy to handle and operated with constant flow from a standard oxygen tank, could be an equally effective alternative to NPPV or nasal high-flow for primary and secondary transports providing maximal oxygenation.",

This finding is surprising, as the Flow-Safe II device has been shown to improve blood gas parameters in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema as effective as NPPV (Uz et al., 2021) . An explanation for the lower efficacy of the Flow-Safe II system in our study may be that we included only healthy volunteers without cardiopulmonary disease. While in patients with pulmonary edema or other acute pulmonary diseases the application of PEEP significantly improves oxygenation, PEEP is less important than FiO2 for oxygenation in non-obese persons without pulmonary pathology (Pelosi et al., 1999; Coruh and Luks, 2014) . FiO2 delivery of the Flow-Safe II device decreases with increasing tidal volume and respiratory rate. As hyperventilation occurred with the Flow-Safe II device, FiO2 may have decreased markedly below 1.0 contributing to the unexpected low oxygenation performance.",

The four most effective devices (NPPV, nasal high-flow, diving regulator and SuperNO 2 VA) achieved a mean arterial pO2 of about 540 mm Hg, which was twofold the mean pO2 achievable with the least effective device. This difference would result in a clinically significant reduction of CO dissociation half-life from estimated 200 min with the least effective device to about 74 min with the most effective devices (Rose et al., 2017) . A further reduction of carboxyhemoglobin half-life can only be obtained with HBO therapy. A recent study in patients with CO intoxication supports this assumption as oxygen therapy via nasal high-flow lead to a faster reduction of carboxyhemoglobin compared to oxygen therapy via conventional face mask (Tomruk et al., 2019) .",

Hyperventilation can result in higher arterial pO2 by increasing the alveolar fiO2 fraction, but might be disadvantageous in case of DCI due to increased oxygen consumption and decreased peripheral tissue perfusion (de Villalobos et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021) . Except for the AirLife Open, mild hyperventilation was observed with all oxygen systems with maximal pH values of about 7.5. Interestingly, the only device where hyperventilation was clinically apparent as indicated by a correlation between pH, pCO2 and dizziness reported by the participants, was the diving regulator. This finding may be biased by the fact that most participants had never used a diving regulator before and reported that breathing with the regulator was very unfamiliar. As DCI occurs in persons who are used to breathing with a diving regulator, hyperventilation may not be present in a diver cohort. Also in terms of hyperventilation, the SuperNO 2 VA performed well with lower pH values at all time points compared to the diving regulator, NPPV and nasal high-flow.",

Although all devices tested were tolerated for 15 min without any premature discontinuation, subjective reported comfort differed between the individual systems. To our surprise, the nasal cannula was rated the least comfortable system followed by the SuperNO 2 VA. At a flow of 15 L/min oxygen, the nasal cannula was described as burning and painful. In contrast, the Air Life Open mask and the standard non-rebreather mask were perceived as very comfortable by mostly all participants. Dyspnea and the effort of breathing were more pronounced in devices that work with a positive airway pressure, anxiety was more common in tight fitting mask systems. Given the experience from this study, we expect that in an emergency it should be possible to bridge a timeframe of one to 2 hours until a HBO center can be reached with all devices.",

In addition, detailed anamnesis is crucial to distinguish between different forms of DCI. By not covering the mouth, the nasal cannula, nasal high-flow, Air Life open and SuperNO 2 VA enable patients to speak and drink without removing the device. This can be advantageous compared to the full-face masks used for the Flow-Safe II device and NPPV and the non-rebreather mask and diving regulator. When these devices are removed for speech or drinking breaks, arterial pO2 rapidly and significantly decreases. This emphasizes the importance of minimizing all interruptions, keeping patient interviews short and helping patients to focus on proper breathing. Proper breathing is especially important in all nasal devices as a decrease in arterial pO2 also occurs in these devices when patients do not breathe through the nose. Therefore, nasal devices might be more suited as bridging devices and less for longer treatment episodes when patients would have to concentrate not to breathe through the mouth.",

From our first experience in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (data not shown) and as reported in patients with pulmonary edema (Uz et al., 2021) , devices like the Flow-Safe II that generate PEEP may perform better in those cardiopulmonary compromised patients than they did in our healthy subjects.
