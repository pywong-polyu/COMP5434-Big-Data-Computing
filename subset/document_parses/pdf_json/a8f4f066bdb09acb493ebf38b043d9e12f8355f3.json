The term apoptosis was fi rst coined in 1972 by Kerr et al. 1 to describe the morphologic features of a type of cell death that is distinct from necrosis and is today considered to represent programmed cell death. In fact, the evidence that a genetic program existed for physiologic cell death came from the developmental studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. 2 As time has progressed, however, apoptotic cell death has been shown to occur in many cell types under a variety of physiologic and pathologic conditions. Cells dying by apoptosis exhibit several characteristic morphologic features that include cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing, nuclear and cellular fragmentation into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies, and eventual phagocytosis of the fragmented cell (Figure 4 .1).",

            "text": "Dysregulation of apoptosis is found in a wide spectrum of human diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic diseases, viral infections, 4 and lung diseases. 5 Our knowledge of cell death and the mechanisms of its regulation increased dramatically in the past two decades with the discovery Nevertheless, necrosis has been shown to occur in cells having defects in apoptotic machinery or upon inhibition of apoptosis, 7 and this form of cell death is emerging as an important therapeutic tool for cancer treatment. 8 Autophagy Autophagy, which is also referred to as type II programmed cell death, is characterized by sequestration of cytoplasm and organelles in double or multimembrane structures called autophagic vesicles, followed by degradation of the contents of these vesicles by the cell's own lysosomal system (see Figure 4 .1). The precise role of autophagy in cell death or survival is not clearly understood. Autophagy has long been regarded as a cell survival mechanism whereby cells eliminate long-lived proteins and organelles. In this regard, it is argued that autophagy may help cancer cells survive under nutrientlimiting and low-oxygen conditions and against ionizing radiation. 9,10 However, recent observations that there is There is early membrane damage with eventual loss of plasma membrane integrity and leakage of cytosol into extracellular space. Despite early clumping, the nuclear chromatin undergoes lysis (karyolysis). Apoptosis: Cells die by type I programmed cell death (also called apoptosis); they are shrunken and develop blebs containing dense cytoplasm. Membrane integrity is not lost until after cell death. Nuclear chromatin undergoes striking condensation and fragmentation. The cytoplasm becomes divided to form apoptotic bodies containing organelles and/or nuclear debris. Terminally, apoptotic cells and fragments are engulfed by phagocytes or surrounding cells. Autophagy: Cells die by type II programmed cell death, which is characterized by the accumulation of autophagic vesicles (autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes). One feature that distinguishes apoptosis from autophagic cell death is the source of the lysosomal enzymes used for most of the dying-cell degradation. Apoptotic cells use phagocytic cell lysosomes for this process, whereas cells with autophagic morphology use the endogenous lysosomal machinery of dying cells. Paraptosis: Cells die by type III programmed cell death, which is characterized by extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization and swelling and clumping of mitochondria, along with absence of nuclear fragmentation, membrane blebbing, or apoptotic body formation. Autoschizis: In this form of cell death, the cell membrane forms cuts or schisms that allow the cytoplasm to leak out. The cell shrinks to about one-third of its original size, and the nucleus and organelles remain surrounded by a tiny ribbon of cytoplasm. After further excisions of cytoplasm, the nuclei exhibit nucleolar segregation and chromatin decondensation followed by nuclear karyorrhexis and karyolysis. decreased autophagy during experimental carcinogenesis and heterologous disruption of an autophagy gene, Beclin 1 (Bcn1), in cancer cells 11, 12 suggest that breakdown of autophagic machinery may contribute to development of cancer. Other interesting studies have shed some light on the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis. These investigations have shown prevention of caspase inhibitor z-VAD-induced cell death in mouse L929 cells by RNA interference directed against autophagy genes atg7 and Bcn1 13 and protection of Bax \u2212/\u2212 , Bak \u2212/\u2212 murine embryonic fi broblasts against staurosporine-or etoposide-induced cell death by RNA interference against autophagy genes atg5 and Bcn1. 14 However, both of these studies were done in cells whose apoptotic pathways had been compromised. Thus, it remains to be seen whether cells with intact apoptotic machinery can also die by autophagy and whether apoptotic-competent cells lacking autophagy genes will be resistant to different death stimuli.",

This form of cell death does not involve caspase activation, is not inhibited by caspase inhibitors, but is inhibited by the inhibitors of transcription and translation, actinomycin D, and cycloheximide, respectively, 15 suggesting a requirement for new protein synthesis. The tumor necrosis factor receptor family TAJ/TROY and the insulin-like growth factor I receptor have been shown to trigger paraptosis. 16 Paraptosis appears to be mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases and inhibited by AIP1/Alix, a protein interacting with the calcium-binding death-related protein ALG-2. 16 Autoschizis Autoschizis is a recently described type of cell death that differs from apoptosis and necrosis and is induced by oxidative stress. 17 In this type of death, cells lose cytoplasm by self-morsellation or self-excision (see Figure  4 .1). Autoschizis usually affects contiguous groups of cells both in vitro and in vivo but can also occasionally affect scattered individual cells trapped in subcapsular sinuses of lymph nodes. 18 The nuclear envelope and pores remain intact while the cytoplasm is reduced to a narrow rim surrounding the nucleus. The chromatin marginates along the nuclear membrane, and mitochondria and other organelles around the nucleus aggregate as a result of cytoskeletal damage and condensation of the cytosol. Interestingly, the rough endoplasmic reticulum is preserved until the late stages of autoschizis, in which cells fragment and the nucleolus becomes condensed and breaks into smaller fragments. 19 Eventually, the nuclear envelope and the remaining organelles dissipate with cell demise.",

Activation of specifi c death genes during the development of this worm results in death of exactly 131 cells, leaving 959 cells intact. 2 Further studies revealed that apoptosis can be divided into three successive stages: (1) commitment phase, in which death is initiated by specifi c extracellular or intracellular signals; (2) execution phase; and (3) clean-up phase, in which dead cells are removed by other cells with eventual degradation of the dead cells in the lysosomes of phagocytic cells. 20 The apoptotic machinery is conserved through evolution from worm to human. 21 In C. elegans, execution of apoptosis is mediated by CED-3 and CED-4 proteins. Commitment to a death signal results in the activation of CED-3 by CED-4 binding. The CED-9 protein prevents activation of CED-3 by binding to CED-4. 22, 23 Mechanisms of Apoptosis Caspases Studies over the past decade have indicated that two distinct apoptotic pathways are followed in mammalian systems: the extrinsic or death receptor pathway and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway. The executioners in both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of cell death are the caspases, 24 which are cysteine proteases with specifi city to cleave their substrates after aspartic acid residues. The central role of caspases in apoptosis is underscored by the observation that apoptosis and all classic changes associated with apoptosis can be blocked by inhibition of caspase activity. To date, 12 mammalian caspases (caspase-1 to -10, caspase-14, and mouse caspase-12) have been identifi ed. 25 Caspase-13 was later found to represent a bovine homolog and caspase-11 appears to be a murine homolog of human caspases-4 and -5, respectively.",

The adapter protein for the receptors TNFR1 and DR3 is TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD) 31 and that for Fas, TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, and DR4 is Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD). 32 The receptor/ligand and FADD complex in turn recruits caspase-8 to the activated receptor, resulting in the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and subsequent activation of caspase-8 through oligomerization and self-cleavage. Depending on the cell type and/or apoptotic stimulus, caspase-8 can also be activated by caspase-6. 33 Activated caspase-8 then activates effector caspase-3. In some cell types, cleavage of caspase-3 by caspase-8 also requires a mitochondrial amplifi cation loop involving cleavage of proapoptotic protein Bid by caspase-8 and its translocation to the mitochondrial membrane, triggering the release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria into cytosol (see Figure 4 .2). In these cell types, overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can block CD95-induced apoptosis. 34 Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 is produced by T cells and activated macrophages in response to infection. Although TNF-\u03b1-mediated signaling can be propagated through either TNFR1 or TNFR2 receptors, the majority of biologic functions are initiated by TNFR1. 35 Binding of TNF-\u03b1 to TNFR1 causes release of inhibitory protein silencer of death domain protein (SODD) from TNFR1, which enables recruitment of adapter protein TRADD. Signaling induced by activation of TNFR1 or DR3 diverges at the level of TRADD. In one pathway, nuclear translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are initiated, which results in the induction of a number of proinfl ammatory and immunomodulatory genes. 36 In another pathway, TNF-\u03b1 signaling is coupled to Fas signaling events through interaction of TRADD with FADD. 37 The TNFR1-TRADD complex can alternatively engage TRAF2 protein, resulting in activation of transcription factor c-Jun, which is involved in survival signaling. Furthermore, binding of receptor interaction protein to TNFR1 through TRADD results in activation of transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which suppresses apoptosis through transcriptional upregulation of antiapoptotic molecules such as TRAF1, TRAF2, cIAP1, cIAP2, and FLIP. The FLICE-associated huge protein was identifi ed to be a CED-4 homolog interacting with the DED of caspase-8 and was shown to modulate Fas-mediated activation of caspase-8. 38 Another class of protein, FLIP (FLICE inhibitory protein), was shown to block Fasinduced and TNF-\u03b1-induced DISC formation and subsequent activation of caspase-8. 39 Cytotoxic T cells play a major role in vertebrate defense against viral infection. 40 They induce cell death in infected cells to prevent viral multiplication and spread of infection. 41 Cytotoxic T cells can kill their targets either by activating the Fas ligand/Fas pathway or by injecting granzyme B, a serine protease, into target cells. Cytotoxic T cells carry Fas ligand on their surface but also carry granules containing the channel-forming protein perforin and granzyme B. Upon recognizing the infected cells, the lymphocytes bind and secrete granules onto the surface of infected cells. Perforin then assembles into transmembrane channels to allow the entry of granzyme B into the target cell. Upon entry, granzyme B, which cleaves after aspartate residues in proteins (\"aspase\"), activates one or more of the apoptotic proteases (caspase-2, -3, -7, -8, and -10) to trigger the proteolytic death cascade (see Figure  4 .2). Fas ligand/Fas and perforin/granzyme B systems are the main apoptotic machinery that regulates homeostasis in immune cell populations.",

Drugs, toxins, heat, radiation, hypoxia, and viral infections are some of The TNF-\u03b1 TNFR1 complex can also elicit an antiapoptotic response by recruiting TRAF2, which results in NF-\u03baBmediated upregulation of antiapoptotic genes. In cytotoxic T lymphocyte-induced death, granzyme B, which enters the cell through membrane channels formed by the protein perforin, activates caspases by cleaving them directly or indirectly. Intracellular Pathways: Lack of survival stimuli (withdrawal of growth factor, hypoxia, genotoxic substances, etc.) is thought to generate apoptotic signals through ill-defi ned mechanisms, which lead to translocation of proapoptotic proteins such as Bax to the outer mitochondrial membrane. In some cases, transcription mediated by p53 may be required to induce proteins such as Bax. Translocated Bax undergoes conformational changes in the outer membrane to form oligomeric structures (pores) that leak cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. Formation of a ternary complex of cytochrome c, the adapter protein Apaf-1, and the initiator caspase-9 results in the activation of caspase-9 followed by sequential activation of effector caspase(s) such as caspase-3 and others. The action of caspases, endonucleases, and possibly other enzymes leads to cellular disintegration. For example, the endonuclease CAD (caspase activated DNAse) becomes activated when it is released from its inhibitor ICAD upon cleavage of ICAD by an effector caspase. Antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit the membrane-permeabilizing effects of Bax and other proapoptotic proteins. Cross-talk between extra-and intracellular pathways occurs through caspase-8-mediated Bid cleavage, which yields a 15 kDa protein that migrates to mitochondria and releases cytochrome c, thereby setting in motion events that lead to apoptosis via caspase-9.",

Although the exact mechanism used by each stimulus may be unique and different, a few broad patterns can be identifi ed. For example, agents that damage DNA, such as ionizing radiation and certain xenobiotics, lead to activation of p53-mediated mechanisms that commit cells to apoptosis, at least in part through transcriptional upregulation of proapoptotic proteins. 42 Other stresses induce increased activity of stress-activated protein kinases, which result ultimately in apoptotic commitment. 43 These different mechanisms converge in the activation of caspases.",

            "text": "The roles of various caspases in apoptotic pathways and their relative importance for animal development have been examined in genetic studies involving knockout of different caspase genes. A caspase-1 (interleukin [IL]-1b converting enzyme [ICE]) knockout study suggested that ICE plays an important role in infl ammation by activating cytokines such as IL-1b and IL-18. However, caspase-1 was not required to mediate apoptosis under normal circumstances and did not have a major role during development. 44 Surprisingly, ischemic brain injury was signifi cantly reduced in caspase-1 knockout mice compared with wild-type mice, 45 suggesting that infl ammation may contribute to ischemic injury. Caspase-3 deficiency leads to impaired brain development and premature death. Also, functional caspase-3 is required for some typical hallmarks of apoptosis such as formation of apoptotic bodies, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation in many cell types. 46 Lack of caspase-8 results in the death of embryos at day 11 with abnormal formation of the heart, 47 suggesting that caspase-8 is required for cell death during mammalian development. In support of this fi nding, knockout of FADD, which is required for caspase-8 activation, resulted in fetal death with signs of abdominal hemorrhage and cardiac failure. 48 Moreover, caspase-8-defi cient cells did not die in response to signals from members of the TNF receptor family. 47 However, cells lacking either FADD or caspase-8, which are resistant to TNF-\u03b1-mediated or CD95-mediated death, are susceptible to chemotherapeutic drugs, serum depriva-tion, ceramide, \u03b3-irradiation, and dexamethasone-induced killing. 48 In contrast, caspase-9 has a key role in apoptosis induced by intracellular activators, particularly those that cause DNA damage. Deletion of caspase-9 resulted in perinatal lethality, apoptotic failure in developing neurons, enlarged brains, and craniofacial abnormalities. 49 In caspase-9-defi cient cells, caspase-3 was not activated, suggesting that caspase-9 is upstream of caspase-3 in the apoptotic cascade. As a consequence, caspase-9-defi cient cells are resistant to dexamethasone or irradiation, whereas they retain their sensitivity to TNF-\u03b1-induced or CD95-induced death 49 because of the presence of caspase-8, the initiator caspase involved in death receptor signaling that can also activate caspase-3. Overall, these observations support the idea that different death signaling pathways converge on downstream effector caspases (see Figure 4 .2). Indeed, caspase-3 is regarded as one of the key executioner molecules activated by apoptotic stimuli originating either at receptors for exogenous molecules or within cells through the action of drugs, toxins, or radiation.",

            "text": "As stated earlier, two major pathways of apoptosis, involving either the initiator caspase-8 or the initiator caspase-9 (see Figure 4 .2), have been recognized. Signaling by death receptors (CD95, TNFRI) occurs through a well-defi ned process of recruitment of caspase-8 to the death receptor by adapter proteins such as FADD. Recruitment occurs through interactions between the death domains that are present on both receptor and adapter proteins. Receptorbound FADD then recruits caspase-8 through interactions between DEDs common to both caspase-8 and FADD forming a DISC. In the DISC, caspase-8 activation occurs through oligomerization and autocatalysis. Activated caspase-8 then activates downstream caspase-3, culminating in apoptosis. The inhibitory protein, FLIP was shown to block Fas-induced and TNF-\u03b1-induced DISC formation and subsequent activation of caspase-8. 39 Of particular interest is cellular FLIP, which stimulates caspase-8 activation at physiologically relevant levels and inhibited apoptosis upon high ectopic expression. 51 Cellular FLIP contains two DEDs that can compete with caspase-8 for recruitment to the DISC. This limits the degree of association of caspase-8 with FADD and thus limits activation of the caspase cascade. It also forms a heterodimer with caspase-8 and caspase-10 through interactions between both the DEDs and the caspase-like domains of the proteins, thus activating both caspase-8 and caspase-10. 52 Apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), a CED-4 homolog in mammalian cells, affects the activation of initiator caspase-9. 53 This factor binds to procaspase-9 in the presence of cytochrome c and 2\u2032deoxyadenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (dATP) or adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and activates this protease, which in turn activates a downstream cascade of proteases (see Figure 4 .2). 54 By and large, Apaf-1 defi ciency is embryonically lethal and the embryos exhibit brain abnormalities similar to those seen in caspase-9 knockout mice. 55 These genetic fi ndings support the idea that Apaf-1 is coupled to caspase-9 in the death pathway. Unlike CED-4 in nematodes, Apaf-1 requires the binding of ATP and cytochrome c to activate procaspase-9. The multiple WD40 repeats in the C-terminal end of Apaf-1 have a regulatory role in the activation of caspase-9. 56",

Several lines of evidence suggest a role for the Fas/Fas ligand system in epithelial cell apoptosis. 90 Fas is expressed on alveolar and airway epithelial cells, 91, 92 and its expression increases in response to infl ammatory mediators such as lipopolysaccharide. Fas-mediated lung cell apoptosis is modulated by surfactant protein A, which inhibits apoptosis in vivo. 93 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, caused primarily by smoking, generally refers to chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Several factors, including protease/antiprotease imbalance, oxidative stress, cigarette smokederived toxins, and infl ammation mediated by neutrophils, macrophages, and CD8 + T cells, have been shown to contribute to the disease process. Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase 94 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibition, 95, 96 but not Fas/Fas ligand, have been shown to play role in the development of emphysema. Asthma Allergic asthma is characterized by intermittent or persistent bronchoconstriction and has been linked to airway remodeling and chronic infl ammation, with increased numbers of eosinophils, CD4 + T cells, and mast cells. Although at present a role for apoptosis in asthma is not confi rmed, studies ex vivo have shown reduced apoptosis of circulating peripheral CD4 + T cells and eosinophils in asthma, which might contribute to infl ammation. Corticosteroids used to reduce infl ammation in asthma have been shown to induce eosinophil apoptosis. 97 ",

Lung cancers can be divided into small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). 103 The SCLCs are relatively more sensitive to anticancer drugs and irradiation than are the NSCLCs, 104 but the molecular basis for this difference is not clearly known. Evaluation of apoptosis-associated substances has shown that caspase-8, Fas, and Fas ligand are often downregulated in SCLCs but not in NSCLCs. 105 An investigation of the basis for these differences revealed that there were no differences in the levels of Bax and Bcl-xL, but the expression of Bcl-2 was found to be signifi cantly higher in SCLC than in NSCLC cell lines. The observation that in some cases Bcl-2 can be converted into a proapoptotic Bax-like death molecule may offer an explanation for the paradoxic expression of Bcl-2 in SCLC. 106 The lack of expression of procaspase-1, -4, -8, and -10 107 reported in SCLC suggests that these caspases probably do not contribute to spontaneous apoptosis in these cells. Apoptosis regulators Apaf-1 and procaspase-3 are overexpressed and are functional in NSCLC cell lines. In both types of lung cancer, apoptotic stimuli result in cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, but only SCLC cell lines showed a relocalization of caspase-3 into the nucleus 108 ; this suggests that the resistance of NSCLC cell lines is probably due to defective relocalization of caspase-3. The expression of caspase-9 and caspase-7 in NSCLCs was found to be similar to normal lung tissue. 109 However, these cell lines express the apoptosis inhibitor and splice variant of caspase-9 CASP9b. In vitro, chemotherapy-resistant NSCLC cell lines exhibit decreased caspase-9 and caspase-3 expression, 110 which suggests an inhibition of apoptosis induction via apoptosome formation in NSCLC.",
