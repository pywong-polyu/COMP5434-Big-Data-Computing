            "text": "We introduce SAW, a tool for safety analysis of weakly-hard systems, in which traditional hard timing constraints are relaxed to allow bounded deadline misses for improving design flexibility and runtime resiliency. Safety verification is a key issue for weakly-hard systems, as it ensures system safety under allowed deadline misses. Previous works are either for linear systems only, or limited to a certain type of nonlinear systems (e.g., systems that satisfy exponential stability and Lipschitz continuity of the system dynamics). In this work, we propose a new technique for infinite-time safety verification of general nonlinear weaklyhard systems. Our approach first discretizes the safe state set into grids and constructs a directed graph, where nodes represent the grids and edges represent the reachability relation. Based on graph theory and dynamic programming, our approach can effectively find the safe initial set (consisting of a set of grids), from which the system can be proven safe under given weakly-hard constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, when compared with the state-of-theart. An open source implementation of our tool is available at https:// github.com/551100kk/SAW. The virtual machine where the tool is ready to run can be found at https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/ \u223c r08922054/SAW. ova.",

            "text": "Hard timing constraints, where deadlines should always been met, have been widely used in real-time systems to ensure system safety. However, with the rapid increase of system functional and architectural complexity, hard deadlines have become increasingly pessimistic and often lead to infeasible designs or over provisioning of system resources [16, 20, 21, 32] . The concept of weakly-hard systems are thus proposed to relax hard timing constraints by allowing occasional deadline misses [2, 11] . This is motivated by the fact that many system functions, such as some control tasks, have certain degrees of robustness and can in fact tolerate some deadline misses, as long as those misses are bounded and dependably controlled. In recent years, considerable efforts have been made in the research of weakly-hard systems, including schedulability analysis [1, 2, 5, [12] [13] [14] 19, 25, 28, 30] , opportunistic control for energy saving [18] , control stability analysis and optimization [8, 10, 22, 23, 26] , and control-schedule co-design under possible deadline misses [3, 6, 27] . Compared with hard deadlines, weakly-hard constraints can more accurately capture the timing requirements of those system functions that tolerate deadline misses, and significantly improve system feasibility and flexibility [16, 20] . Compared with soft deadlines, where any deadline miss is allowed, weakly-hard constraints could still provide deterministic guarantees on system safety, stability, performance, and other properties under formal analysis [17, 29] . A common type of weakly-hard model is the (m, K) constraint, which specifies that among any K consecutive task executions, at most m instances could violate their deadlines [2] . Specifically, the high-level structure of a (m, K)constrained weakly-hard system is presented in Fig. 1 . Given a sampled-data system\u1e8b = f (x, u) with a sampling period \u03b4 > 0, the system samples the state x at the time t = i\u03b4 for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , and computes the control input u with function \u03c0(x). If the computation completes within the given deadline, the system applies u to influence the plant's dynamics. Otherwise, the system stops the computation and applies zero control input. As aforementioned, the system should ensure the control input can be successfully computed and applied within the deadline for at least K\u2212m times over any K consecutive sampling periods.",

Our approach tries to derive a safe initial set for any given (m, K) constraint, that is, starting from any initial state within such set, the system will always stay within the same safe state set under the given weaklyhard constraint. Specifically, we first convert the infinite-time safety problem into a finite one by finding a set satisfying both local safety and inductiveness. The computation of such valid set heavily lies on the estimation of the system state evolution, where two key assumptions are made: 1) The system is exponentially stable under nominal cases without any deadline misses, which makes the system state contract with a constant decay rate; 2) The system dynamics are Lipschitz continuous, which helps bound the expansion under a deadline miss. Based on these two assumptions, we can abstract the safety verification problem as a onedimensional problem and use linear programming (LP) to solve it, which we call one-dimension abstraction in the rest of the paper.",

Table 1 shows the benchmark settings, including the (m, K) constraint set for each benchmark. Then, we show how different parameter settings affect the verification results of our tool. All our experiments were run on a desktop, with 6-core 3.60 GHz Intel Core i7. Table 2 shows the experimental results. It is worth noting that the one-dimension abstraction cannot find the safe initial set in most cases from [17] . In fact, it only works effectively for a limited set of (m, K), e.g., when no consecutive deadline misses is allowed. For general (m, K) constraints, one-dimension abstraction performs much worse due to the over-conservation. Furthermore, we can see that, without exponential stability, one-dimension abstraction based approach is not applicable for the benchmarks #5 and #6. Note that for benchmark #2, onedimension abstraction obtains a non-empty safe initial set X 0 , which however, does not contain the given initial state set. Thus we use \"No\" instead of \"-\" to represent this result.

By constructing a reachability graph for the grids based on existing tools, the tool leverages graph theory and dynamic programming technique to compute the safe initial set. We demonstrate that our tool can significantly outperform the state-of-theart one-dimension abstraction approach, and analyze how different constraints and parameters may affect the results of our tool. Future work includes further speedup of the reachability graph construction via parallel computing.",
