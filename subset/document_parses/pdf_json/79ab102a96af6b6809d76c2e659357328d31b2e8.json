            "text": "www.nature.com/scientificreports/ To monitor the effect of national governmental restrictions on mental health, the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) was introduced. It enables the measurement of the stringency level of restrictions 51 , whichis based on three groups of indicators: community mobility, economic aspects and public health. This is rescaled to a value ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 denotes the strictest restrictions. During data collection, the stringency level varied across Poland, Slovenia, Czechia, Ukraine, Russia, Germany, Turkey, Israel, and Colombia, from the lowest in Czechia (41.67) to the highest in Colombia (87.04) (detailed analysis in Supplementary Table S1 ). The stringency of restrictions affects mental health as a study in six countries shows, although its role is rather limited 22 . The aforementioned macrolevel indices pertaining to the nine countries selected for the present study (Poland, Slovenia, Czechia, Ukraine, Russia, Germany, Turkey, Israel, and Colombia) are outlined in detail in Table S1 . All countries differ regarding their socioeconomic situation as measured by the GII and S&P credit rating as well as the course of the pandemic indicated by means of the stringency level. The indexes are presented on geographical maps (Fig. 1 ) and reflect the situation at the moment of the study (May-July 2020). The aforementioned socioeconomic indices (GII and S&P Global Rating), together with the stringency level, have rarely been analyzed regarding mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Bayesian multilevel skew-normal regression analyses with a country as a grouping variable (i.e., 'random effect') were employed to reveal predictors of dependent variables: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7), perceived stress (PSS-10), and depression (PHQ-8). This allowed us to combine macrolevel variables with individuallevel variables, with a country as a grouping variable. Gender, place of residence, and education constituted individual-level predictors and were estimated at the population and country levels (i.e., these effects could vary between countries), and were entered into the model with sum-tozero contrasts. The country-level predictors, GII, stringency, and S&P rating were recoded to provide an informal grouping of countries surveyed in the study. The GII and stringency were coded with sum-to-zero contrast, whereas linear (L) and quadratic trends (Q) were estimated for the S&P rating due to the ordinal character of the variable. Dependent variables were z-scaled before modeling; thus, the regression weights were on a standardized scale. Additionally, Bayesian R 2 was provided for each model 53 . A summary of the models parameters are presented in Table 4 . Only gender had a credible effect on the GAD-7 values, with average values being credibly lower among men than among women (Fig. 3) . Similarly, the average PSS-10 score was credibly lower among men than women (Fig. 4) . Gender also had a credible effect on PHQ-8 scores, again with an average value credibly lower among men than among women (Fig. 5) . Additionally, the average PHQ-8 was credibly lower among participants with master's degrees and higher among participants with bachelor's degrees. The effect of the place of residence was also credible. To investigate the factor further (since the regression weights represent differences from the grand mean), a post hoc analysis was conducted. The only credible difference between the averages was observed for the comparison of towns and villages, d = 0.14, [0.02, 0.27], with a higher average for towns (Fig. 5 ).",

However, discussion concerning the average anxiety and depression levels has been hindered by a variety of measurements used in research. On the other hand, previous evaluations of anxiety prevalence with the same measurement (GAD7) in Polish (35%) 30 and Israeli students (56%) 58 showed different prevalences, 46.80%, and 32.70%, respectively, compared to our results. However, those differences might have been due to the type of university or the field of study. The prevalence of moderate and high stress (84.90%) in Czech students was higher than that in the general Czech population before (35.40%) and during (51.10%) the COVID-19 pandemic 60 . Ukrainian students reported similar prevalence of anxiety and depression risk (19%) compared to a large sample of Ukrainian students in other studies during the COVID-19 pandemic (18.85%) 39 . Additionally, Polish students suffered from substantially higher depression risk prevalence (49.20%) than Polish students examined before the COVID-19 pandemic (21.98%) 61 . The analysis of the Bayesian multilevel regression model showed that, consistent with other works 30, 31, 36, 37 , female gender in students was a predictor of high perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. The additional predictors for depression were the place of residence and the level of study. In contrast to the results of Chinese research 40 , students from rural areas presented lower depression levels. Furthermore, students at the bachelor's level reported higher depression than those with master's degrees or higher, which is similar to research concerning the general population 19, 26 However, being a first-cycle student was not a credible predictor of anxiety or perceived stress in the student sample. The stringency of restrictions was of trivial importance in the multilevel model. It seems that more psychological importance is laid upon the perception of restrictions' efficacy 22 , usefulness 24 , self-protective values 62 , or motives for compliance with restrictions 63 . The role of the Gender Inequality Index (GII) and global credit rating was found to be irrelevant in the surveyed models of mental health predictors. This might be due to several issues, such as the number of investigated countries. On the other hand, such a result may be explained by the specificity of the student population, which varies from the general population. For example, in our study, the number of female students exceeded that of male students in countries with high GII. Therefore, the global indices could explain mental health to a higher degree in the general population because the global student population is frequently more homogeneous.",

Second, the results pertaining to the participant level were obtained via self-reported questionnaires. Therefore, they can be subject to retrospective response bias. Finally, the lack of random sampling and the representation of the student population limited to specific regions in each country make it difficult to generalize the results. The irrelevance of macrolevel indices might be due to the small number of countries and a narrow range of indices within the nine surveyed countries. Therefore, the prospective verification of the proposed model based on a larger number of countries seems valid. www.nature.com/scientificreports/",

In particular, female students are at high risk of perceived stress, anxiety and depression across Poland, Slovenia, Czechia, Ukraine, Russia, Germany, Turkey, and Colombia. As far as high perceived stress and anxiety levels are concerned, they may be interpreted as an adaptive response to the extremely volatile and unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression risk prevalence seems to be the most alarming factor, as it is even higher than the anxiety prevalence. Considering the recurring reports on severe mental health issues among students globally, the issue should be recognized at public health levels by governments or other international bodies. Our results underline the universities' need to provide dedicated programs and regular psychological support to students. The survey was created via Google Forms in eight countries. The German data were collected via SoSci Survey. Sampling was purposive, with the selection criterion being a university student. The invitation to the online questionnaire was sent to students by researchers via email, social media and the Moodle e-learning platform. The average time of data collection was 23.26 min (SD = 44.03). No form of compensation was offered as an incentive to participate. To minimize sources of bias, the student sample was highly diverse due to its key characteristics: the type of university, field of study and cycle of study.",

The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) enables tracking of the stringency of government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic across countries and time 51 . The stringency level is composed of multiple indicators. It refers to community mobility: school closings, workplace closings, cancelation of public events, restrictions on gathering, public transport closings, stay at home requirements, restrictions on internal movement, international travel restrictions; and economic measures: income support, debt/contract relief, fiscal measures, and international support. The final set of indices relates to public health issues: public information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracking, emergency investment in health care, investments in vaccines, facial coverings, and vaccination. However, not all indexes were available in all countries. Those detailed measurements are rescaled to a value ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 denotes the strictest restrictions. The timing was crucial for the stringency level evaluation. The stringency value in this study was evaluated based on the mean of the given stringency value on the first and the last days of data collection in each country 51 . Subsequently, those values for each country were dichotomized to the median to be incorporated into the statistical model. The results are shown in Table S1 . The analysis encompassed descriptive statistics: mean (M), standard deviation (SD), 95% confidence interval (CI) with lower limit (LL) and upper limit (UL).
