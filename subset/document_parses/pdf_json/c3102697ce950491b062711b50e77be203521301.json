            "text": "Purpose: It is unclear how much opening of schools during Covid-19 pandemic contributes to new SARS-CoV-2 infections among children. We investigated the impact of school opening with various mitigation measures (masks, rotations, mass testing) on growth rate of new cases in child cohorts ranging from kindergartens to upper secondary in Czechia, a country heavily hit by Covid-19, since April 2020 to June 2021. Methods: Our primary method is comparison of the reported infections in age cohorts corresponding to school grades undergoing different regimes. When there is no opportunity for such a comparison, we estimate corresponding coefficients from a regression model. In both the cases, we assume that district-level infections in particular cohorts depend on the school attendance and the external environment in dependence on the current overall risk contact reduction. Results: The estimates of in-cohort growth rates were significantly higher for normally opened schools compared to closed schools. When Contribution of Schools to Covid-19 Pandemic prevalence is comparable in the cohorts and general population, and no further measures are applied, the in-cohort growth reduction for closed kindergartens is 29% (SE=11%); primary: 19% (7%); lower secondary: 39% (6%); upper secondary: 47% (6%). For secondary education, mitigation measures reduce school-related growth 2-6 times. Conclusion: Considering more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants and the 'long covid' risk, mitigation measures in schools, especially in secondary levels, should be implemented for the next school year. Some infections, however, are inevitable, even in kindergartens (where mitigation measures are difficult to implement) and primary schools (where they may not work due to low adherence).",

            "text": "Closing schools for in-person education during the Covid-19 pandemics presents a controversial issue. During the first half of 2020, closing schools appeared to be one of the most effective intervention to mitigate the Covid-19 spread [1] [2] [3] ; however, closed schools negatively impact children [4] [5] [6] [7] . Consequently, governments tended to open schools for the school year 2020/21, but with various safety measures; mask wearing and mass screening among others. Altogether, most of these measures appeared to reduce the risk of spreading the disease in schools [8] [9] [10] . However, there is still uncertainty how much open schools contribute to the number of child infections; especially as concerns younger cohorts, including kindergartens wherein mitigation measures are difficult to implement. Children may be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [11, 12] (but see also [6] ), but outbreaks occur even in preschool settings [13] and number of school cases tend to increase when incidence in general population increases [14] [15] [16] .",

In the model, the infections in the child cohorts depend on the overall magnitude of epidemic, its magnitude within the district and within the corresponding cohort, the latter in dependence on the current school opening regime. Hence, the model reflects the dependence of the effect not only on the regime introduced, but also on prevalence within the involved cohorts.

We assume that this number linearly depends on the previous-week numbers of infections -the overall number, the number within own district and the number within own district and own cohort. In all the three cases, these numbers are adjusted by the contact restriction reported two weeks earlier and the previous-week rate of infectiousness. Additionally, the infections in the cohort within the district depends on the influence of schools, being equal to the previous-week infections in this cohort, multiplied by the sum of dummy variables corresponding to six considered opening regimes -once the regime is applied, the variable is one while the remaining dummy variables are zero. When schools (for this cohort) are closed, all the dummies are zero. See Section SA for details and for justification of this general model. When comparing two cohorts, we assume both to follow their own version of the linear model described above (see (4) in Section SA). The advantage here is that the regime covariates which do not differ between cohorts, cancel out, so our estimate is independent on these parameters. Moreover, even though we do not explicitly assume an identical impact of the external environment on both the sub-cohorts, these impacts are likely to be similar for the cohorts, so they more or less compensate by the subtractions, disturbing less the impact of the regime terms. Note that, once total closure is compared to some regime, the significant results of this estimation can be interpreted as a rejection of the hypothesis that the corresponding regime has no influence on infections.",

The meta-estimates are computed as weighted averages of the direct estimates and available comparison ones with strong preference of the latter (see Section SC for details). To distinguish the quality of the meta-estimates, we have split them into the following four categories. Clearly, the better category, the more reliable the estimate. The resulting estimates are listed in Table 1 and Figure 1 . Missing estimates refer to situations when schools were never opened in corresponding regimes. Apparently, upper secondary school coefficients are larger than lower secondary school coefficients, which are larger than primary school and kindergarten coefficients. For secondary education levels, mitigation measures reduces the coefficients notably; whereas, for primary schools, they remain similarly low no matter the regime. (For kindergartens, no mitigation measures were implemented: they were either open or closed.) Further, for each school level and each regime, we evaluated the mean changes to the growth in the corresponding cohort associated with imposing the regime. In particular, we computed the hypothetical, mean relative increase r of the growth after opening closed schools in that regime, and a hypothetical, mean relative decrease e of the growth after imposing the regime into a school opened without any mitigation measure. These quantities can be computed for various c t (contact restriction) and G t (prevalence ratio, Eq. 2); here, for simplicity, we assumed identical previous prevalence in and outside the cohort Table 1 Meta-estimates of regime coefficients (SE in parentheses). * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01 of the two-sided hypothesis.

On the one hand, our results are not robust enough to pin down effectiveness of individual measures. Plus, our estimates for schools run without any mitigation measure are least robust. On the other hand, our estimated for schools run with face masks are more robust. Hence, altogether, these results support another emerging idea: that schools run with various mitigating measures, including face masks, have tens of percent lower risk of infection for students [8, 9, 19 ], but some of these effects may be weaker for primary schools [9]. Relatively low school-related growth for primary schools in Czechia agrees with other literature [8, 20] . A new, surprising finding concerns kindergartens: the school-related growth rate does not appear to be particularly low therein. This supports another emerging idea that the difference in susceptibility/infectiousness between young children and adults may be lower than thought at the beginning of the pandemic (see [6] ). Plus, biological susceptibility/infectiousness can be obscured in kindergartens by these children being less able to adhere to hygienic norms and to keep distance among themselves and teachers.",

Reducing the risk of Covid-19 spread in schools is especially important in the light of more infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the majority of children being unvaccinated. Mortality and hospitalization among young people is low [6], but 'long covid' could burden a notable proportion of infected children [21, 22] (but see also [23] ).

The strengths also include robustness of the model with respect to various ad hoc specified external parameters (apart from infectiousness; see Section SE for the respective sensitivity analysis). Our results are relatively robust with respect to the fact that some cases remain unreported (the ascertainment rate is non-unit). The main reason for this robustness is that we primarily study relative growth which is more or less independent of the ascertainment rate. Section SF shows that the fact that some cases are not reported either does not disturb the analysis at all or our estimation procedures may be modified to accommodate this fact. For instance, under the natural assumption that school regimes including regular testing increase the ascertainment rate, our results do not change substantially (Section SF).",

Generally, we assume that this number depends on the previous-week number of infections, the contact restriction reported two weeks earlier, and the previous-week rate of infectiousness. In addition to the total number of infections in population, we take into account the number of the infections in the same district, and the number of the infections in the same cohort within the district. See Section D for the justification of this general model. In addition, we extend this general model by explicitly modeling the influence of school opening regime on the infection number in the cohort.",

Moreover, even though we do not explicitly assume an identical impact of the external environment on both the cohorts, these impacts are likely to be are similar, so they likely more or less compensate by the subtractions, disturbing less the impact of the regime terms.

Note that, contrary to Estimation procedure C, the estimation does not depend on values of M when they are equal, which may be seen as an advantage of Estimation procedure CC. On the other hand, once different regimes are applied for the two sub-cohorts, as in the example above with last grades of lower secondary schools open, and the sub-cohorts are treated equally otherwise, we get U t = (\u00b5\u2212\u03c1)\u03c7 {M 1 t =R 1 t } (t) where \u03c7 is a characteristic function, i.e. only a difference of \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c1 is estimable while the individual parameters are not identifiable.

Each September first, children who completed their sixth year are obliged to enter the first grade of a primary school. When the parents wish, a child who is six as late as by the end of the year can enter the first class, too, some children, on the other hand, start their school later for various, mostly developmental, reasons. If we neglect these minor exceptions, we can conclude that the first year pupils are six or seven years of age. Consequently, the vast majority of the primary level (Grade 1-5) pupils belong to the age cohort 6-11; the vast majority of the lower secondary school students (Grade 6-9 in Czechia) belong to the cohort 11-15; and the upper secondary school students (typically Grades 10-13 in Czechia) belong to the cohort 15-19. As for the kindergartens, where the usual lowest age for admission is three, the vast majority of children attending kindergartens falls into the cohort 4-6. The pre-school year (Grade 0) is compulsory. Younger children's attendance in pre-school institutions is optional, but the majority of children do attend them. For simplicity we assume that the frontier one-year cohorts split by half between the competing school categories, so the infections occurring in the cohort split by two between each category. Consequently, the number of cases by pre-school children over week t in the i-th district will be X k i,t = Z 4 i,t + Z 5 i,t + 1 2 Z 6 i,t , the number by the primary level X f i,t = 1 2 Z 6 i,t + Z 7 i,t + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + 1 2 Z 11 i,t , by the lower secondary level X s i,t = 1 2 Z 11 i,t + Z 12 i,t + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + 1 2 Z 15 i,t and that by the upper secondary schools X e i,t = 1 2 Z 15 i,t + Z 16 i,t + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + 1 2 Z 19 i,t ,where Z j i,t is the number of cases by the j-year old individuals in the i-th district.

Figure 3 displays prevalence in child cohorts and overall prevalence, Figure 4 the ratio of the child cohort prevalence to the overall one (the ratio equals to G \u22121 t ) (see 2), finally Figure 6 shows fraction of cases in the child cohorts in the overall case number. Even though the first cases in Czechia appeared in the beginning of March, 2020, we do not take data until April-05-2020 into account, as we regard them as noisy, unreliable and suffering from small sample properties.

The time lag two weeks of the contact restriction was chosen as that maximizing the correlation: max \u03c4 corr(Y t , c t\u2212\u03c4 Y t\u22121 ), the infection rate was determined as d t = w t r t i t . Here, w t = (1 + \u03c2 cos(at + b)) -where \u03c2 = 0.18, a and b are set so that the period is one-year period and the peak is on January, 10th -is a cyclic component reflecting the (direct or indirect) influence of weather conditions. Further, r t is the course of infectiousness, determined by the composition of the virus variants present in Czechia, which we assumed to be constant, equal to r 0 = 1.55, up to the end of 2020, linear up to March-01-2021 (due to alpha variant onset), and then constant, equal to r 1 = 2.44. Finally, i t = (1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03b9 t ) is the effect of natural immunization, where \u03b1 = 0.4 is the ascertainment rate and \u03b9 t is the ratio of total reported infections within the examined cohorts (i.e. children from age 4 to 19 and the half of the cohort of 20-year-olds). As no children younger than 16 were vaccinated by June 2021 and only a small minority of students over 16 had got their first dose by that time, we did not include the effect of vaccination in d t . The parameters \u03c2, r 0 , r 1 we obtained by estimation; notably, the value of \u03c2 is very close to that obtained independently by [24] . The ascertainment rate \u03b1 has been set according the rate of respondents of [18] suffering from typical covid symptoms who underwent testing.
