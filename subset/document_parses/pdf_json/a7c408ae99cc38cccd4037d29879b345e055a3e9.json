            "text": "It is well reported that the frequency and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is significantly lower in children compared to the total infected population [1] . This is similar to the lower mortality rate in children during 1918 'Spanish flu' as the most deadly influenza pandemic, SARS-CoV (2002), 2009 'H1N1 flu' outbreak, and MERS-CoV (2012) [2, 3] . Less outdoor activities, as well as minimal exposure to air pollution and cigarette smoke, are among possible reasons for lower infection of children to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [3, 4] . Although the exact cause of lower frequency and mortality of COVID-19 in pediatric patients remains obscure, the difference in the composition and functional responsiveness of the immune system to COVID-19 in children and adults can be of critical importance. It has been suggested that the milder COVID-19 disease presentation in children might be due to [3] [4] [5] : (1) the different response of children vs. adults in terms of immunosenescence and inflammaging. Children appear to have protective T helper 2 immune response and eosinophilia, and also lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. (2) The resistance to SARS-CoV-2 in children due to maturational changes in the axonal transport system which can restrict the viral transmission. A similar phenomenon has been observed in immature mice resistant to poliovirus-induced paralysis. (3) Virus-virus interactions in children vs. adults that might mitigate replication of the SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, the simultaneous presence of different viruses in the mucosa of children leads to a cross-reactive humoral immunity, T cell immunity, and growth competitions that limit the severity of COVID-19; (4) lower gene expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor in children vs. adults. Investigations on ACE-2 gene expression in the nasal epithelium have shown a strong linear trend of ACE-2 expression which increases with the advancing age group [6] . ACE-2 is known to be the receptor for SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63). Studies have indicated that patients under 12 years old with SARS-CoV disease had milder symptoms and were less likely for admission to an intensive care unit. Similarly, HCoV-NL63 infection in patients aged 16-25 years was more severe than those aged 5-16 years; and (6) influence of Bacillus Calmette-Guva\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine in children that can lead to protection against the severity of COVID-19, most probably through trained immunity phenomenon. Trained immunity is a memory-like response in the innate immune system, which enhances responsiveness to subsequent triggers. In this article, we discuss the possibility of GP-340 abundance as a potential cause for less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We also elaborate on the potential role of this glycoprotein as a novel therapeutic target.",

It belongs to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) family of proteins that is mainly involved in tumor suppression or innate immune defense. As a part of the innate immune response, GP-340 binds to surfactant A (SP-A) and surfactant D (SP-D) that has been suggested to contribute to the clearance of microorganisms from the lung. Lung GP-340 binds less avidly to SP-D than salivary GP-340. Salivary GP-340 was identified as a key element involved in the innate host defense on mucosal surfaces against a range of oral bacteria as well as HIV-1 and influenza A virus (IAV) [7] . The antiviral activity of GP-340 was noted only against these two viruses suggesting a common mechanism of action. Both of these viruses have an enveloped RNA, with a glycoprotein target on their surfaces, i.e. GP-120 in HIV and hemagglutinin in IAV.",

            "text": "HIV-1 infects host cells by binding to a cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) through GP-120 in the presence of coreceptors, such as CXCR4 or CCR5. Specifically, GP-120 undergoes conformational changes and binds to chemokine receptors and facilitates the virus entry. It has been suggested that GP-340 can exhibit an inhibitory effect on HIV-1 infection by binding to viral GP-120 in a region different from CD4-binding site. Interestingly, the prebinding of sCD4 (CD4i epitope) to GP-120 enhances the interaction of GP-340 with GP-120 and can hinder virus entry. Thus, it can be concluded that the inhibitory effect of GP-340 might be due to the blocking access of GP-120 to chemokine receptor that can prevent GP-120 conformational changes for viral and cell membrane fusion [8] . On the contrary, Stoddard et al. reported that GP-340 may promote heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 through transcytosis of the virus in genital tract-derived cell lines and primary endocervical tissues [9] .",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded and positive-sense RNA virus, which is phylogenetically related to group 2 coronaviruses, but it does not encode the hemagglutinin-esterase. One may argue that there is a lack of glycoprotein target (unlike hemagglutinin in IAV and hemagglutinin-esterase in coronaviruses) on the surface of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein is selectively recognized by lung SP-D and activates macrophages [10] . GP-340 binds to SP-D and it has been reported that the lung GP-340 has cooperative interactions with SP-D in viral neutralization and aggregation assays. In a study performed by Hartshorn et al., a donor presented noticeably higher salivary GP-340 activity against avian-live flu IAV strains. Furthermore, the density of \u03b1(2,3)-linked sialic acids linkage on GP-340 was much higher in this donor. Since IAV strain prefers to bind sialic acid in the \u03b1(2,3) linkage, the specificity of sialic acid linkage on GP-340 can be used as a factor of anti-IAV activity. Lung GP-340 is reported to co-operate with SP-D in viral neutralization; however, salivary GP-340 has been reported to antagonize the anti-viral activity of SP-D against IAV strains. The reason for this contrary activity is still unknown [11] . This effect was associated with greater binding of salivary GP-340 to the carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-D as compared with the binding of lung GP-340. Interestingly, there is a direct association between elevated plasma SP-D levels and SARS-CoV-1-specific IgG antibody titers in infected patients, and monitoring systemic SP-D is useful for keeping track of the alveolar integrity in SARS-CoV-1 pneumonia [12] .",

Moreover, saliva from healthy donors prevented the binding of spike-protein-specific polyclonal antibodies to spike antigen, suggesting that the spike protein's glycoprotein-binding domains (GBD) may be targeted to obstruct SARS-CoV-2 adherence or internalization [14] .

The results showed a higher content of GP-340 in the whole saliva of the youngest age group compared with the adult group, thereby suggesting a vital innate immunity factor present in children's saliva [15] . One can speculate that since children have higher GP-340 along with lower ACE-2 receptors [13] , they present a different response against SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with adults.",

However, the differences between children and adults in terms of prevalence and severity of COVID-19 can potentially be harnessed to understand the pathology of the disease and develop effective therapeutics. Among all distinctive features of children and adults in response to viruses, age-related abundance of GP-340 protein in children seems promising as this protein can bind to spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, thereby reducing cell adherence and entry of viral particles. Therefore, proof-of-concept studies on the role of GP-340 as a promising therapeutic target for COVID-19 are greatly recommended. Finally, more studies need to verify this hypothesis in vitro and in vivo models.",
