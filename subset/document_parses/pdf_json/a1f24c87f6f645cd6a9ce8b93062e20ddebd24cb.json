To date, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases have been reported, with a case fatality rate of 34% (1) . MERS-CoV is a zoonotic pathogen that is intermittently transmitted from dromedary camels to humans leading to local outbreaks with limited human-to-human transmission. Sero-surveillance indicates that MERS-CoV is enzootic in dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula and Africa, and in contrast to humans, only causes a mild respiratory tract infection in camelids (2-4). Interestingly, the majority of zoonotic infections in humans, as well as higher sero-prevalence of camel exposed workers, are more frequently observed in the Middle East compared to Africa (5, 6) . Possible reasons for this pattern might lay in the genetic differences of the virus across the two regions, as well as cultural discrepancies or a lower awareness and surveillance in Africa (5, (7) (8) (9) . Nevertheless, travel-related cases in 27 countries, as well as nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals, such as in South Korea in 2015 (186 cases and 36 deaths), have been reported and highlight the need for continuous surveillance to mitigate future epidemics (10) .",

This can be partly explained by the different distribution of the functional receptor -serine exopeptidase Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP4) -for MERS-CoV in humans and camelids, which likely influences the limited human-to-human transmission (12, 15) . However, the observed discrepancy in the clinical resolution between MERS-CoV infected humans and camelids also suggests that other host determinants, such as the innate immune system, might be of importance.",

Histological and functional characterization revealed that both camelid AEC culture models closely resemble the in vivo morphology, actively respond to IFNs, and are permissive to MERS-CoV. These three characteristics illustrate that the established camelid AEC model allows detailed future comparative studies on virus-host interactions in human and camelid respiratory epithelium.",

Following the isolation and expansion, epithelial cells from the old and new world camelids were seeded on semi-permeable cell culture inserts. Once cells reached confluency, the cultures were air-lifted to establish an Air-liquid interface (ALI) to allow for cellular differentiation. During the differentiation process, the development of the camelid AEC cultures was monitored by immunofluorescence analysis with 7-day intervals for a total duration of 28 days.",

In addition to the quantitative measurements, camelid AEC cultures were histologically compared with autologous ex vivo tissue from the corresponding anatomical region.

To determine whether both camelid AEC models are susceptible to MERS-CoV, we inoculated well-differentiated Bactrian camel and llama AEC cultures with 4000 PFU of MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV EMC/2012) at 37 \u00b0C. At 2 hours post-infection (hpi), the apical surface was washed three times with HBSS. Subsequently, virus progeny release was monitored every 24h for the duration of 96 hours by virus titration and qRT-PCR.Interestingly, in both Bactrian camel and llama AEC cultures we observed efficient, albeit dissimilar, MERS-CoV replication profiles. In Bactrian camel AEC cultures MERS-CoV readily reached a plateau at 24 hpi after which the amount of infectious progeny virus declined overtime(Figure 2A, C). In contrast, the overall MERS-CoV replication kinetics in llama AEC cultures was delayed, as MERS-CoV reached the highest titer at 96 hpi(Figure 2B, D).",

This suggests potential differences in IFN receptor distribution and/or downstream signaling cascades inducing the expression of ISGs tempering MERS-CoV replication. These results, together with the previously reported in vivo data of MERS-CoV infection in alpacas, suggest dominant role for type I and III IFNs in camelids (24). Moreover, since both recombinant type I and III IFNs also efficiently inhibited MERS-CoV in human AEC cultures it would be worth to evaluate the therapeutic potential of IFNs towards MERS-CoV, as well as further investigating MERS-CoV interaction with IFN-related pathways in different host species (17). Such analyses can now be performed using the camelid AEC cultures in conjunction with the analogous human AEC cultures, to provide detailed information on crucial virus-host innate immune response dynamics in both the natural and zoonotic hosts. In summary, our results demonstrate that these cultures can serve as a biologically relevant model to characterize fundamental molecular virus-host interactions of MERS-CoV at the natural site of infection in camelids. Altogether, the established camelid AEC culture system, in combination with human AEC cultures, facilitates future detailed characterization of the molecular basis of the pathogenesis discrepancy of MERS-CoV in humans and camelids in a biologically relevant system.",
