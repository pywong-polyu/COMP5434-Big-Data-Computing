These group of patients often required Tracheostomy for proper management and ventilation. As Surgeons we often required to examine and perform procedures in head and neck patients and are in high risk of exposure to aerosol and droplet contamination. We did a literature search for research regarding tracheostomy and its post procedure care during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this review various international guidelines and sources were put together, and we aim to summarize in a systematic way the available recommendations: indications, timing, technique and safety measures for tracheostomy for COVID-19 patients, from all over the world.",

            "text": "First described case of coronavirus was identified in the Hubei region of China in December 2019, since then Coronavirus has been spreading rapidly across countries. World Health Organization (WHO) declared the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) a pandemic due to the increasing number of cases around the world on March 11th 2020. Most of the people who contracted COVID-19 presented with mild symptoms (80.9%), and according to WHO study approximately 14% patients develop severe disease [1, 2] . Patients who reach the severity of the disease and ICU requirement, the prognosis remains poor. Clinically patients affected by coronavirus shows symptoms associated with viral pneumonia, most commonly fever, cough, sore throat, myalgia, and fatigue [3] [4] [5] . Patients who develop severe disease are hypothesized to cause classic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has led to the use of mechanical ventilation which is a matter of concern [6] . There are evidences that patients with mechanical ventilation have 100% mortality [7] . The timely intervention in the form of endotracheal intubation can be lifesaving but it has been seen that prolong ventilation and proper weaning can be difficult with endotracheal intubation. Hence in these patient tracheostomies becomes a necessary tool [8] . However it is an aerosol generating procedure and care must be taken to avoid contracting infection to the surgeon, critical care intensivist and other health care staffs. Surgical tracheostomy is relatively safer when done on sedated and intubated patient in ICU comparable to awake patient or percutaneous cricothyrotomy because droplet generation and air flow can be controlled [9] .",

Decision for tracheostomy should be taken by multidisciplinary team consisting Surgeon, Intensivist and/or Pulmonologist. The risk and benefits of the procedure to be explained to the relatives of the patient. The tracheostomy may not always be life saving as all those require the procedure may not survive but it comes at the cost of risk of infection to the health care staff and relative of the patient. Besides the challenging nature of the procedure in the COVID-19 patients, it is followed by long periods of functional dependency and rehabilitation.

Viral load in the body cannot be correlated with severity of the symptoms and vice versa [15] . Coronavirus is normally most abundant around the time of symptom onset. Once symptom occurs, viral load decreases over the following 3-4 days, this was shown in RT-PCR studies for coronavirus. Typically, lower respiratory track samples are PCR positive long after patients turn upper respiratory track sample PCR negative. Patients with severe disease has significantly higher viral RNA load which decreases more slowly than in those with mild disease [16] [17] [18] . Apart from all these facts one more thing to remember is a negative report should not assure that exposure risk has passed as sensitivity of the COVID-19 PCR test is around 71% [19] . Majority of country including India has limited resources in these pandemic time which precludes multiple testing in single patient.

It is a practical challenge to transfer a high risk patient from ICU to operative room and care should be taken to manage the shifting without delay and with minimal handling. Awake tracheostomy and cricothyroidotomy should be avoided as far as possible and the procedure should be performed by most experienced personal [23] .

Trachea should be visualised and entry should be made under vision. Bipolar cautery is used to arrest any bleeding during the procedure. Ventilation should be paused during the entry of trachea if possible [24] . Ventilation should be resumed after checking the cuff and inflated beyond the tracheal cut with no air leak. Ideally the position of the tracheostomy tube should be confirmed with EtCo2 by the anaesthetist [25] . Initially cuffs should be inflated and pressures to be checked every 12 h, maintained at 20-30 cm H 2 O pressures.

Usage of closed circuit is advised at all times. Handling such as deflating the cuff and dressing should be reduced as far as possible. Tube change can be delayed to atleast 7 days [11] . Humidification and disposable inner cannula can be used to safeguard against tube occlusion from respiratory secretions, it can reduce the requirement of suctioning and cleaning [28] . A simple heat and moisture exchange (HME) filter, which provides adequate humidification and does not generate aerosols is also recommended. Sometimes the secretions are thick, so water based humidification is required but their use should be assessed on patient to patient basis. Nebulisers is helpful in secretion clearance by reducing the tenacity but require additional handling of ventilator circuits which can be avoided if possible and can waterlog HME filters; they should therefore be used only after careful consideration [29] . Above all patients inside ICU should be consulted in full PPE, facemask and shield.",

Here in this article we try to put everything together regarding how to take care of tracheostomy patients in the COVID-19 era. While taking care of the tracheostomy patients, safety of the health care professionals is most important. There are still many grey areas as infectivity period, optimal technique of tracheostomy to reduce the aerosol production.

In our set up and with the expertise available we prefer open surgical technique for tracheostomy in both emergency and ICU. In our experience proper staff training regarding the handling of COVID positive patients and taking care of personal protection is utmost important, full PPE, face shield, N95 mask and gloves should be used and this was suggested in other studies as well",
