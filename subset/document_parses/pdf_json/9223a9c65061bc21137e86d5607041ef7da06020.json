It is unclear if this situation will affect long-standing infection prevention practices and impact on healthcare associated infections. Here, we report a nosocomial cluster of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) that occurred on a COVID-19 dedicated intensive care unit (ICU) despite intensified contact precautions during the current pandemic. Whole genome sequence-based typing (WGS) was used to investigate genetic relatedness of VRE isolates collected from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during the outbreak and to compare them to environmental VRE samples.",

It soon became apparent that even in developed countries COVID-19 will set an unprecedented challenge to hospitals due to a high influx of critically ill patients, demand for mechanical ventilation beds and shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) [4] [5] [6] . Understandably, major staff and financial resources have been diverted to COVID-19 outbreak management in hospitals, especially in regions with high case numbers [7] . One concern among the infection prevention community is that the COVID-19 pandemic will cause \"collateral damage\" to long-established infection control measures including the prevention of healthcareassociated infections [8] . So far, it remains unknown if the present diversion of hospital resources and changes in infection control practices will translate into an increase of nosocomial transmissions, in particular of multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO), during the COVID-19 pandemic or if the increased efforts to improve infection control measures will have a positive effect on nosocomial MDRO transmissions [9, 10] .",

Seventy-four thousand patients per year and treating up to 140 patients on 11 ICUs or intermediate care units. During the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the ICUs was separated into two subunits, treating COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients, respectively. Enhanced infection control measures were put in place for confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients, including isolation in the COVID-19 ward and the use of PPE (gloves, gowns, FFP2 masks and safety googles). In April 2020, VRE from clinically relevant samples (blood culture samples and pleural drainage) were detected in three patients from both ICU subunits. As this rate exceeded the baseline of three VRE infections per year on this ward, an outbreak investigation was initiated andin accordance to the German guideline published in 2018 -a bundle strategy for terminating VRE transmission was implemented [16] . This bundle comprised a point prevalence screening among all patients, a VRE screening on admission and once a week for every patient, environmental sampling to detect VRE contamination of patient surroundings, contact precautions including the use of PPE (gloves and gowns) and patient isolation. Isolation of patients could be discontinued if three anorectal swab samples collected in at least a one-week interval without administering antibiotic therapy during this time were negative for VRE. In addition, intensified surface disinfection was established using an alkylamine, Inci-din\u2122 plus 0.5% (ECOLAB Healthcare, Monheim am Rhein, Germany), focussing in particular on patient rooms, nurses' rooming homes, storage rooms and staff rest rooms. Moreover, hand hygiene training was performed among nurses, physicians and cleaning personnel.",

Libraries were scaled to reach 100-fold sequencing coverage for an average genome size of 3 MB. Only sequencing runs that fulfilled the manufacturers' specifications (Illumina) with respect to cluster density and Q30 were further analyzed. After sequencing, the raw reads were quality-trimming and de novo assembled using the SKESA algorithm with default parameters [18] that is implemented in the Ridom SeqSphere + software version 7.0.1 (Ridom GmbH, M\u00fcnster, Germany) [19] . For subsequent core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), the previously published cgMLST scheme for E. faecium was used [20] . Here, every sample had to have \u226595% extracted cgMLST targets, otherwise sequencing had to be repeated. Based on the allelic profiles from cgMLST; we constructed a minimum spanning tree to display the genetic relationships between isolates, a minimum spanning tree algorithm was applied. We rated isolates differing \u22643 alleles as closely related with a high likelihood of resulting from a clonal transmission event [21, 22] . In addition, van-genotypes and MLST sequence types (ST) were extracted from the WGS data in silico using SeqSphere + .",

The close genetic relatedness between environmental VRE samples and patient VRE isolates indicated a role for contaminated surfaces in this cluster. Indirect contact has been frequently described as route of transmission for VRE in the hospital setting, due to the persistence of the bacterium [14, 22] . WGS in combination with epidemiological data analysis suggests that contaminated surfaces were also involved in ongoing transmission during this reported cluster. Analysis of the WGS data showed that the VRE isolates of patients in the COVID-19 isolation ward differed by 6 alleles to the isolates of SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. However, based on epidemiological data, it is difficult to draw conclusion if this represents two separate transmission events. The majority of clones identified during the cluster were MLST ST117 and vanB positive. These clones are known to cause nosocomial outbreaks and match the current VRE epidemiology in German hospitals [23] . Enhanced infection control bundles were effective in terminating the transmission chains.",

Environmental sampling uncovered not only VRE, but also a variety of other nosocomial pathogens such as vancomycin susceptible enterococci, S. aureus, nonfermenters and Enterobacterales. This illustrates the importance of hand and surface disinfection within infection prevention bundles. At the time of the cluster, minimum staffing requirements in German hospitals have been suspended in order to cope with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This situation is worrying as reduced personal is associated with poor adherence to infection control measures [24, 25] . Surveillance strategies will be important to elucidate any increase in hospital acquired infections and transmission events during this challenging situation. Infection control specialists need to raise awareness for long-established infection control routine measures as part of COVID-19 management in order to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with nosocomial infections.",
