Two great successes are the Halmos-von Neumann classification of ergodic MPT's with pure point spectrum by countable subgroups of the unit circle [HN42] and D.

For every u \u2208 [0, \u221e] there exists an ergodic Lebesgue measure preserving rigid transformation T with ent \u00b5 n t (T ) = u. Currently we do not know if there exists a rigid transformation T with ent \u00b5 n t (T ) = ent \u00b5 n t (T ) = u for some 0 < u < \u221e.

In particular, it provided the first example of an ergodic C \u221e diffeomorphism on the disc D 2 . In a more general framework as described in [K03, chapter 8] , one can consider any measure space admitting a non-trivial circle action R = {R t } t\u2208S 1 . The transformations are constructed as limits of conjugates T n = H n \u2022 R \u03b1 n+1 \u2022 H \u22121 n with \u03b1 n+1 = p n+1 q n+1 = \u03b1 n + 1 kn\u00b7ln\u00b7q 2 n \u2208 Q and H n = H n\u22121 \u2022 h n , where the h n 's are measure-preserving maps in the regularity under consideration (e.g. measurable, smooth or real-analytic) satisfying R 1 qn \u2022 h n = h n \u2022 R 1 qn .

The existence of a good cyclic approximation implies various properties for the limit transformation T as summarized in [K03, Proposition 3 .2], e.g. T is ergodic, rigid, has simple spectrum and its maximal spectral type is singular.

It suffices to prove the theorem for any scaling function {a n (t)} n\u2208N,t>0 with at least polynomial growth. In particular, for any given t 1 > 0, there exists t 2 > t 1 such that a n (t 2 ) > a n 2 (t 1 ) for all n \u2208 N.
