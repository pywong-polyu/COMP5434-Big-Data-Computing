There has been no attempt at a systematic review on this major health issue. Hence, in this study, a meta-analysis was undertaken to quantify the overall risk of liver damage in COVID-19 patients and also find the overall variation in risk outcome. Materials and methods A meta-analysis was carried out on the findings of four published studies that were related to the albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels of COVID-19 patients. The pooled mean for each of these three measurements was estimated by using a random-effects model. Results The pooled means for albumin, AST, and ALT in COVID-19 patients were 38.84 g/L [95% confidence interval (CI): 35.83-41.86], 27.28 IU/L (95% CI: 18.30-36.26), and 24.44 IU/L (95% CI: 15.73-33.15) respectively. There was a high degree of divergence among the studies, with the index of heterogeneity being more than 90%. Conclusion The ALT and albumin pooled means were reported to be within the normal range; however, the pooled mean of the serum AST level was found to be high in COVID-19 patients. The pooled means reported in this study can be useful for working out the degree of liver damage in COVID-19 patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "An unknown outbreak of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan in December 2019 and rapidly spread all over China and, now, the whole world.

It is spread from person to person in the community. However, there is no drug on the market with definite curing effects, so the main strategy is focused on symptomatic support.

In the host, firstly, the synthesis of polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab) takes place from the viral RNA. The clinical variety of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms to respiratory failure to multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
