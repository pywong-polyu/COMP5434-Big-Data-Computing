It establishes in an explicit way the extent of an epidemic spread process in a population. The current estimation methods for the time evolution of R(t), using incidence data, rely on the generation interval distribution, g(\u03c4 ), which is usually obtained from empirical data or already known distributions from the literature. However, there are systems, especially highly heterogeneous ones, in which there is a lack of data and an adequate methodology to obtain g(\u03c4 ). In this work, we use mathematical models to bridge this gap. We present a general methodology for obtaining an explicit expression of the reproduction numbers and the generation interval distributions provided by an arbitrary compartmental model. Additionally, we present the appropriate expressions to evaluate those reproduction numbers using incidence data. To highlight the relevance of such methodology, we apply it to the spread of Covid-19 in municipalities of the state of Rio de janeiro, Brazil. Using two metapopulation models, we estimate the reproduction numbers and the contributions of each municipality in the generation of cases in all others. Our results point out the importance of mathematical modelling to provide epidemiological meaning of the available data.",

When it is greater than 1, each infected individual tends to generate more than one infected individuals resulting in the occurrence of an epidemic outbreak. The reproduction number is usually known from its initial value, when all of the population is susceptible, known as the basic reproduction number R 0 . Due to the recovery of infected individuals, a portion of the population becomes immune to the disease, thus, herd immunity begins to emerge in the population. This acts as a barrier to the transmission of the disease, so R(t) takes into account the evolution of the number of susceptible individuals in the population and is usually referred as the effective reproduction number. It provides us with information on how disease transmission occurs during the outbreak it is an important metric to make healthcare managers aware of the current level of the disease propagation.",

This equation emerges from the mathematical models dynamics and can be derived using infection-age models. This type of modelling comes from the study of age-structured population growth and was first used within the scope of mathematical demography with the aim of modeling the birth dynamics due to the offspring produced by an individual over its lifespan. Analogously, the same methodology can be applied to the infectious diseases scenario by modelling the generation of new infected individuals during the infection period of those previously infected [4] . Infection-age models are the origins of the widely known SIR and SEIR models developed by Kermack-Mckendrick [5] . Most known compartment ODE models for infectious diseases have their infection-age identical counterparts. The advantage with respect to the infection-age models is that they allow us to have access to the distribution of the infected individuals during the infectious period.",

In this section, we consider a general heterogeneous model that separates the individuals in m homogeneous compartments. For the purpose of evaluating the reproduction number, we first consider a sub-set of variables encompassing the infected compartments, i.e., those compartments containing individuals that carry the etiologic agent in their organisms. These compartments are denoted by x(t, \u03c4 ) = (x 1 (t, \u03c4 ), ..., xn(t, \u03c4 )), where t and \u03c4 indicate, respectively, the calendar time and the infection-age, the time elapsed since they got the infection. Of course the condition x(t, \u03c4 ) = 0 for \u03c4 > t must be satisfied. If m = m i + m 0 , where m i and m 0 indicate the number of infected and non-infected compartments in the homogeneous model, n = m i . Therefore, x represents the number of individuals in each compartment at a specific calendar time \"t\" and at infection age \"\u03c4 \". x entries can be called the infection-age distributions. The total number of individuals in each compartment, denoted as X i (t), can be obtained by integrating x i (t, \u03c4 ) with respect of \u03c4 from zero to infinity, where X(t) = (X 1 (t), ..., Xn(t)). For simplicity, we will be using matrix notation in some equations. The matrices and vectors will be identified by using bold font, whereby M (y, z) = M ij (y, z) . Also, as usual, integrals and derivatives with respect of scalar variables operate componentwise.",

It is suitable when the population sizes are not permanently affected by the flow of individuals, as in the case of commuter movement between locations of residence, work and study. This type of movement is obligatory cyclical, predictable and recurring regularly, most of the time on a daily basis. In this model, we assumed that each meta-population i, with N i individuals, has its own transmission rate \u03b2 i (t). Also, the movement of individuals between meta-populations is taken into account, where we introduce \u03a6 ij (t) as the density of flow between the populations i and j.

In order to have consistence description of this aspect, it is wise to assume that the existence of two classes of infected individuals, the symptomatic and the asymptomatic/undetected ones, as considered in a general model for the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus [28] . Therefore, we now take into account infected individuals who do not need to be hospitalized and are not recorded in official registered data, thus becoming undetectable.

In addition, we obtain daily mobility data for each Brazilian state from a public report by Google, accessed at: https://google.com/covid19/mobility/. We used the data observed until September 14th, 2020, and performed a 10-day moving average, in order to attenuate noise and better express the data trend. To take the social distancing restrictions into account, we considered only the commuter movement data related to work, since, with the mitigation measures of COVID-19, the flow due to education were significantly reduced. In addition, because the movement towards work also dropped due to social isolation policies, we used the mobility data obtained from the community mobility report provided by Google to estimate this reduction. This database compares for each state the daily mobility to workplaces with the past trends, therefore, we can access the percentage of reduction in commuting to work. A moving average is performed in the mobility time series and we reduce the intermunicipal work flow according to the percentage indicated on the data. Thus, we obtain the flow of individuals due to commuter work that leads to \u03a6 ij (t). The parameters used to feed the model were obtained in [30] and are displayed in Supplementary Material 3.",

With T ij (t) we are able to access the contribution of each municipality on the outbreaks happening in the state. Thus, by dividing T ij (t) by B i (t) in every time step, we obtain a time series for the proportion of the total cases in \"i\" generated by \"j\". Therefore, we proceed into evaluating the mean value through time of T ij /B i , where it is displaced in Figure 2 . It is observed a high autochthonous behavior on the disease transmission, whereby the highest influence of a city is on itself. Therefore, most of the cases generated in a municipality are caused by its own individuals. However, we also identify cities where the cases generated by other municipalities on it are very important. The R(t) matrix also corroborates the presence of an important autochthonous behavior as its diagonal elements correspond to the highest values of the reproduction numbers. We also observed lots of very smalloff-diagonal elements low values through out the matrix. In Figure 3 we illustrate the results of Figure 2 , whereby only non-autochthonous influences above 5% are considered. Thus, we must highlight the capital, Rio de Janeiro (RJ), as the most important agent on the disease transmission to the municipalities on the network. However, cities like Nova Igua\u00e7u (NI) also presents itself as a relevant disseminator of the pathogen. As shown in Figure 1 , Nova Igua\u00e7u NI is the highest city in case exportation, besides the capital. In Figure  3 (Mq) and Queimados(Q) as the main receptors of those cases. Niter\u00f3i (Nt), even having a NIlike number of exported cases, did not presented a high influence on a lot of cities. On the other hand, Niter\u00f3i (Nt) generates a significant amount of cases in S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo (SG), highlighting the importance of the connection of those two municipalities. We illustrate the time series reconstruction in Figure 4 where two scenarios are displaced. In the first one, we focus on the cases reported in S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo (SG) and compare total amount, B i (t), with the number of daily cases in SG generated by Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Niter\u00f3i (Nt). We observe that Nt has a predominance over the capital, presenting a higher number of cases generated in all times. The second scenario is related to the total number of cases in S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Meriti (SJdM) and the contributions due to Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Nova Igua\u00e7u (NI). In this case, the capital presents the largest number of cases generated in that city, besides the city itself. It is also interesting to observe in both scenarios how the cities contributions merge into a part of the total cases notified on a municipality.",

The methodology presented in this work is very general and can be applied to multiple disease transmission systems. By merging the model dynamics with the available epidemic data, this method is able to estimate key epidemiological factors, like the reproduction numbers and the generation interval distributions. These theoretical results are the basis for a lot of possible data analyses, specially for highly heterogeneous systems that have been demanding for a suitable methodology for estimating the reproduction number through actual data. The method is robust and reproduces known results in literature, as shown in Supplementary Material 1 for the SIR, SEIR and SEIIR models. This methodology opens room for the analyses of more sophisticated models, that leads to a better understanding and control of infectious diseases.",

Factors like the presence of asymptomatic individuals, risk groups and spatial distribution of the disease brings out a system with multiples layers of heterogeneity [26, 27, 32, 33] . Although the application of some vaccines starts recently, mitigating COVID-19 with non-pharmacological strategies is essential. Therefore, the second half of this work we focused on the application of the developed methodology for two models with spatial heterogeneity, one focusing on the COVID-19 specific dynamics. Each municipal demography, captured by \u03b2 parameters, and the commuter movement were combined by the model lead to some interesting results. The reproduction numbers are obtained for both models indicate that they only differ by multiplying factors, as 1/\u03b3 and p \u03b3s + \u03b4(1\u2212p) \u03b3a , as in [28, 30] . The measured results shows that the asymptomatic presence is related to an increase on the reproduction number, because the model predicts more infected individuals than what is reported. Another substantial result is obtained when comparing the exported cases with the total commuter movement in a municipality. In this case, the relationship is not direct, since the intricate topology of the network fosters a non-linear dynamic in the phenomenon. This result points up the importance of a model to provide epidemiological meaning of the available data. For this specific case, it became evident that analysing the system only by the commuter movement data wouldn't be enough to point out the key cities on the disease transmission dynamic, as we did using the models and methodology.",

The capital is highlighted as the main hub of spreading, which is related to its high incidence of the disease combined with its central role on the movement behavior of individuals on the network, as also observed in [26, 30, 34] .

Another limitation of this work is that it does not consider the interstate flow, since the state of Rio de Janeiro was portrayed as a closed system Also, we did not take into account further heterogeneous features, which could be accounted as well by the general theoretical formalism, besides space and asymptomatic presence, leaving a gap for other key COVID-19 dynamics characteristics, like age-groups. In addition, the examples presented in this work considered actual reported data of confirmed cases and mobility, which may present problems of underestimation and report delay. Taking those limitations into account, the results displaced here are still able to give substantial understanding of the system studied, which is a common feature in mathematical modelling.

After a mean latency period of 1/k, those infected can become symptomatic or asymptomatic, I s and I a respectively. While in these compartments, the individuals of \"j\" are able to generate new infected ones in \"i\" based on the transmission rate \u03bb ij .

It is assumed that the susceptible population can only decrease due to infection process, therefore, no life and death dynamic. In the same way, the removed individuals are only generated by a removing rate \u03b3, uniform for all meta-populations. Gathering those considerations, we write the system of equations:Where it is clear that when \u03d5 ij = 0, for all i's and j's, each meta-population will be described by the classical SIR homogeneous model. Of course, this SIR approach is not taking into account the other heterogeneities of a disease besides space.

To do so, we consider, as in 4 , that the infected individuals can be separated in three classes: the exposed E, individuals infected which are in the latency period and do not transmit the disease; the symptomatic individuals I s , that are infectious, present a substantial amount of symptoms and are registered in the official data; the asymptomatic/undetected ones I a , that are infectious but present mild/non-existing symptoms and are not registered in the official data. The infected individuals always start in the exposed compartment, a portion p of them eventually becomes symptomatic and the other (1 \u2212 p) portion becomes asymptomatic. Since we have two types of infectious individuals, both of them must be taken in consideration in the generation of new infected. Therefore, assuming that the asymptomatic individuals transmission rate is a fraction \u03b4 of the symptomatic transmission rate, it is simple to derive, similarly to (60) and (61), the number of infected individuals that are generated on the exposed compartment of each meta-population:Therefore, by the same assumptions presented on the previews section, the following model is obtained:Whereby \u03ba, \u03b3 s and \u03b3 a are the removing rate of the exposed, symptomatic and asymptomatic compartments, respectively, and are uniform in all meta-populations.",

Firstly, we start by substituting the explicit expressions of the reproduction numbers of each model in the equation 2.24 of the main framework. After some straightforward calculations, we obtain:whereby, Q i (t) = B i (t)/S i (t) andfor the SIR model andfor the SEIIR model. We consider that the B i (t) is the collection of all the new infections during a \u2206t time interval of 1 day. With appropriate units of measure, we have \u2206t = 1. In the SIR model we consider that every infection is reported, \u03c1 i = 1 and in the SEIIR case only the symptomatic individuals report their infections, \u03c1 i = p. We proceed into estimating the susceptible population. If we integrate (65) and substitute (62) and equation 2.23 of the main framework, we get:Finally, substituting (63) and (64) in (74) results in:for:Therefore value of Q i (t) and \u03b8 ij for each day can be obtained using the reported data and parameters. Thus, for each day, this leaves us with algebraic system of \"n\" variables, \u03b2 j (t) and \"n\" equations. We can analytically solve this system for every meta-population, with the help of a computer algorithm, and obtain the daily values of \u03b2 j (t) of every meta population. Substituting the values of every \u03b2 j (t) in (63) and (64), we can compute the values of the \u03bb i j(t)'s which leads us to the values of the reproduction number, equations 3.1 and 3.2 of the main framework.Since the available data is of daily number of cases, the R(t) is evaluated for each calendar day.",
