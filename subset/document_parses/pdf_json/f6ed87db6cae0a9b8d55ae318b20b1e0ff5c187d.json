Systematic reviews and metaanalysis of over 40 000 cases from over 100 studies estimated that 13%-17% of positive cases were asymptomatic. 1 2 On 3 August 2020, Public Health Scotland, on behalf of the Scottish Government, commenced a prospective surveillance study to monitor the prevalence of COVID-19 among asymptomatic outpatients attending dental clinics across 14 health boards in Scotland. 3 The aim of the project was to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic-screened dental patients to inform community surveillance and improve understanding of risks in the dental setting. 4 This was a public health project aiming to gain a better understanding to help with control of COVID-19. Ethical approval was waived by the West of Scotland Ethics Service. Patient participation was voluntary, and consent was obtained verbally. All patients were eligible provided they were over 5 years of age and asymptomatic for COVID-19. For the period of the quality improvement project (QIP), participants could only be tested in the enhanced surveillance study once. Of the 6115 asymptomatic patients who were tested in Scotland during the first 16 weeks, 34 tested positive. 5 Over the first 5 weeks of the programme, on average, 27 swabs were collected each week at Glasgow Dental Hospital and School. The National Programme set targets for each Health Board based on national population distribution. Increased participation was required to meet these targets.",

Non-participation was defined as a patient attending but not taking part in the Surveillance Programme. This included eligible and ineligible patients. Due to varying clinical demands and staff participation, not all departments were able to collect data on reasons for non-participation. Cases for which no data were recorded were defined as 'missed events. ' One hundred and sixty-one patients were recorded as ineligible to participate in the study. The most common reasons for exclusion were that they had already anticipated in the surveillance project at a previous appointment or there was a language barrier.

The dental nurses felt they were often too busy with normal clinical duties to also be involved in swabbing patients or that they did not have the confidence to participate. Subsequently training was provided to all members of staff wishing to participate, with a focus on specific sessions for dental nurses to improve knowledge and confidence levels.

The main reason for patient non-participation was patient refusal at 31.6% with dentist refusal very low at 0.9%. 6 There were many 'missed events' describing patients who attended the hospital but the reason why they did not participate in the surveillance programme was not known and/or the treating clinician did not ask their patient. Anecdotally, 'missed events' were usually a result of clinicians forgetting to ask their patients. Sometimes, the staff member tasked to carry out the testing was not available due to sickness or last-minute changes in the rota. The hope, in these situations, was that the treating member of staff would carry out the test themselves. This very rarely happened. This highlights the importance of having a staff member designated or rotated to carry out surveillance. An Australian study assessed the knowledge and attitudes of general practice staff towards pandemic influenza and found only 36% completed the survey provided. 13 A Swiss study asked primary healthcare workers to record symptoms of influenza-like illness in a weekly online survey distributed via email and self-collect a nasopharyngeal swab if any symptoms were recorded. Just over half (53.7%) of the staff provided data for the study. 14 In Scotland, healthcare staff uptake of rapid lateral flow self-testing has been reported at one time point to be as low as 27.7%.",

An additional difficulty, specifically relating to the paediatric dentistry department that became apparent, was the large number of patients deemed inappropriate for involvement.

Therefore, the baseline data collection was limited, and ideally a baseline of 12-14 weeks of data would be preferable. Similarly, in response to this desire to increase the numbers of swabs being carried out rapidly, there was a decision to simultaneously implement multiple interventions in some weeks, rather than adopting the conventional approach to studying each intervention individually. This made it more difficult to assess the effectiveness of individual interventions. This surveillance project concluded shortly after the time frame studied in this report and therefore it was not possible to assess the sustainability of the interventions. Due to the success of the wider surveillance project, it is possible that dental and other outpatient teams could be involved again in the surveillance of transmissible diseases. Future projects could hopefully use our findings as a baseline and measure the sustainability of these and any further interventions. Senior clinical staff were informed about the project at an early stage. However, information as of itself did not translate into engagement. The improvement team in this project could be described as a peripheral subject group consisting of clinical and academic staff in contrast to a central subject group which would include senior organisational managers. We used concepts of institutional entrepreneurship such as seeking the support of hospital management which helped to raise the awareness of the project, create a power base and allowed the team to use resources. 15 The improvement team also used their position as colleagues of senior clinicians to network and build relationships in an attempt to increase their acceptance of the surveillance project. Despite this, senior clinician engagement was found to be a significant barrier to increasing numbers of tests carried out. There were considerable competing demands on senior clinical staff, and future work should investigate how to improve senior staff engagement in the process. In terms of the external validity of this report, it is important to emphasise that this QIP was carried out within secondary care. Further studies would be required to evaluate the success and barriers of integrating this into a primary care setting.",
