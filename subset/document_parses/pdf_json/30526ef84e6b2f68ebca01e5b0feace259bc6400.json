This paper therefore undertakes a whole-system approach and explores optimal pathways towards 100% renewable energy by 2050. The analysis is carried out for Ireland, which currently has the highest share of variable renewable electricity on a synchronous power system. Large numbers of scenarios are developed using the Irish TIMES model to address uncertainties. Results show that compared to decarbonization targets, focusing on renewable penetration without considering carbon capture options is significantly less cost effective in carbon mitigation. Alternative assumptions on bioenergy imports and maximum variability in power generation lead to very different energy mixes in bioenergy and electrification levels. All pathways suggest that indigenous bioenergy needs to be fully exploited and the current annual deployment rate of renewable electricity needs a boost. Pathways relying on international bioenergy imports are slightly cheaper and faces less economic and technical challenges.

TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) [40] is an economic model generator for local, national, multi-regional, or global energy systems. The model is data-driven and includes a technology-rich database for representing energy dynamics over a multi-period time horizon. TIMES assumes that each agent has perfect foresight on the market's parameters and computes the inter-temporal dynamic equilibrium by minimising total discounted energy system cost over the entire time horizon with decisions made on equipment investment and operation, primary energy supply and energy trade for each region. The cost minimization considers investment costs of energy technologies, operation and maintenance costs, the cost of imports, profits from energy exports, and the residual value of technologies at the end of the horizon. TIMES is thus a vertically integrated model of the entire extended energy system. TIMES is now widely used by over 62 contracting parties supported by ETSAP (Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program), an Implementing Agreement of the International Energy Agency (IEA). The Irish TIMES model is an instance of the TIMES model developed for Ireland. The original Irish TIMES dataset was extracted from the Pan European TIMES (Pan European TIMES model that includes EU27, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Balkans countries) project by the Energy Policy and Modelling Group at University College Cork, and was updated with more detailed local data, calibrated to the national energy system with macroeconomic projections from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). The time horizon in the Irish TIMES model used is from 2005 to 2050 with a time resolution of four seasons, each is comprised of day, night and peak time slice.

In our model the constraints applied on renewable resource potentials are based on relatively conservative assumptions. Compared to analysis assuming wind and solar power can provide all renewable electricity [22] , the generation portfolio from our modelling results is more diversified with combinations of wind, solar, offshore wind, wave and tidal energy, which is also more energy secure compared to 100% WWS power system as ocean energy is more predictable than wind and solar.
