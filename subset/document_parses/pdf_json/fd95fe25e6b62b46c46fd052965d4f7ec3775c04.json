Manipulating and looking at the device (experimental condition), more than its mere manipulation (control condition), was critical to elicit a mimicry response in the observer. Sex, age and relationship quality between the experimenter and the observer had no effect on the smartphone mimicry response that tended to decrease during social meals. Due to the role of food as a tool in increasing social affiliation, it is possible that during communal eating, people engage in other forms of mimicry involving facial expressions and postures rather than the use of objects. Understanding the ethological mechanisms of the use of smartphones at everyday-social scale could unveil the processes at the basis of the widespread/increasing use of these devices at a large scale.",

            "text": "The use of smartphones is defined as \"any application of the cell phone as a tool, including talking, text messaging, game playing or the sheer accessibility of the instrument\" (Banjo et al. 2008, p. 127) . In 2020, the diffusion of smartphones reached the 44.81% of the population all over the world with 3.50 billion of users (Statista 2020) . Smartphones are regularly used by people, from the youngest to the oldest ones, not only to call but also for texting, surfing on internet, playing or taking pictures and videos (Banjo et al. 2008 ). Smartphones are used in a wide variety of social situations such as places of entertainment (cinemas, theatres), parks, public transportation (bus, train), waiting rooms, restaurants and job spaces (Park 2019; Manzerolle 2013 ). On the one side, smartphones have the function to socially connect people who are spatially distant (Manzerolle 2013) , thereby favour the sharing of information at a large scale (Oulasvirta et al. 2012 ). On the other side, the use of smartphones can increase social isolation through interference and disruption with real-life ongoing activities (Bugeja 2005; Gill et al. 2012 ). This may cause distress (Chesley 2005) , and in some cases, reduce the sense of volitional control (Thom\u00e9e et al. 2011) . The use of smartphones in public spaces is transforming our roles from active social participants to inactive observers, thus making us mere bystanders of our social lives (Cumiskey 2005) . While using smartphones, people are less likely to give help to others and engage in less nonverbal social behaviours, such as smiling, that are crucial to the communicative exchange during social interactions (Banjo et al. 2008) . Finally, the negative consequences generated by a compulsive use of smartphones can lead to symptoms, usually described as \"dependence\" or \"addiction\" (Chen et al. 2017) , that can have repercussions also on entire societies (Park 2019) . Young women seem more subjected to this kind of addiction. In fact, Lee and co-workers (2016) demonstrated that in South Korea young women were significantly more dependent on smartphones than young men. This dependence translates into negative feelings such as anxiety and sense of insecurity in case of smartphone deprivation (Lee et al. 2016) .",

The unintentional, unconscious imitation is one of the mechanisms at the basis of the diffusion of some behavioural traits (Chartrand and Lakin 2013; van Baren et al. 2009 ). Humans often mimic spontaneously others' behaviours, without being aware of doing it (Chartrand and Lakin 2013; Van Baaren and Fockenberg 2006) . Mimicry occurs when two or more individuals unintentionally engage in the same behaviour at (more or less) the same time (Chartrand and Lakin 2013) . To describe this phenomenon, some scholars coined the term \"chameleon effect\", which refers to the passive and unintentional behavioural matching between two or more subjects in a given social situation (Lakin and Chartrand 2003; Chartrand and Bargh 1999) .",

In the experimental condition, the experimenter took, kept in hands and manipulated his/ her smartphone (fiddling and swiping) while looking at the screen for at least 5 s. In the control condition, the experimenter took, kept in hands and manipulated his/her smartphone (fiddling and swiping) for at least 5 s without looking at the screen.

The LR test was used also to test the significance of the fixed factors using the function Anova in the R-package car 3.0-10 (Fox and Weisberg 2019). To exclude the occurrence of collinearity among predictors, we examined the variance inflation factors (VIF; Fox 2016) by means of the R-package performance 0.4.4 (L\u00fcdecke et al. 2020) . No collinearity has been found between the fixed factors (range VIF min = 1.06; VIF max = 1.57). Model fit and overdispersion were checked using the R-package DHARMa 0.3.3.0 (Hartig 2020). The marginal R 2 , which represents the variance explained by fixed factors only, and the conditional R 2 , which represents the variance explained by the entire model including both fixed and random effects (Nakagawa et al. 2017) , were calculated using the R-package MuMIn 1.43.17 (Barto\u0144, 2020) . Then, we used the \"confint(x)\" function to interpret the estimated effects as relative odds ratios. Relative odds ratio (i.e. the expected odds change for one unit increase in the explanatory variable when the remaining variables are set to their reference category) were used to evaluate the magnitude of the estimated effects. We performed all pairwise comparisons for the levels of the multilevel factor with the Tukey test (Bretz et al. 2010 ) using the R package emmeans (Length et al. 2020) .",

In fact, mimicry becomes evident only when the trigger is looking at the device (Fig. 1) . The short time latency (< 30 s) of the response indicates a certain level of automaticity and spontaneousness of the phenomenon (van Baren et al. 2009 ). In the literature, there is a debate about the degree to which mimicry phenomena are goal-or movement-based. While some scholars argue that observers extract the high-level goal of an observed behaviour and use this goal as a guide for their own course of action (e.g. Wohlschl\u00e4ger et al. 2003; Bekkering et al. 2000) , others suggest that individuals merely match specific movements to the observed ones without necessarily sharing or adopting the same goal (e.g. Genschow et al. 2013 ). Since the mimicry effect was evident only when the triggers devoted their own attention to the device, our finding seems to support the goal-directed hypothesis. The main goal (here the attention to the device and not its simple manipulation) can activate in the observer the motor programme that is mostly associated with the achievement of that goal (Wohlschl\u00e4ger et al. 2003) . However, further data on the mimicry in the use of smartphones will be necessary to fully understand the proximate factors at the basis of the behaviour.",

Obviously, mimicry can occur only when the observers own the device and have the possibility to handle it. People that do not possess a smartphone can suffer social exclusion due to the mimicry effect operating daily at a group level (Cacioppo et al. 2011) . People, who refuse to use smartphones, can experience frustration or anger when their ingroup members are infected by others' behaviour and begin to navigate from live to virtual social interactions. This can lead to two possible outcomes. From one side, people can reduce their social encounters with their ingroup members thus experiencing an objective social isolation (Hawkley et al. 2008; Ruiz 2007) . On the other side, to avoid experiencing perceived social isolation, which is highly related to the quality of social bonding shared between ingroup members (Hawkley 2008) , people can start using the device to conform to others.",

The daily time course of mimicry in the use of smartphones differs from that recorded for other forms of mimicry such as contagious yawning that shows two daily peaks, in the morning and in the evening/ night (Giganti and Zilli 2011) . Since yawning can act as a synchronizer by aligning activities of a social group (Palagi et al. 2020) , it has been argued that the evening/night peak could serve to communicate tiredness and the need for sleep. It is possible that the level of attention and alertness of people that in the morning generally peak can translate into higher level of susceptibility to undergo to smartphone mimicry. Such higher susceptibility could be also linked to a higher motivation to renovate virtual contacts after a period of short separation, that is the night. Moreover, people experiencing high levels of perceived social isolation also show peak levels of cortisol in the morning (Adam et al. 2006) . It could be possible that during this period people can be more motivated to shorten social distance by mimicking others thus dealing with their negative emotional state. Due to the lack of studies on the mimicry response in the use of objects (e.g. cigarettes, pens) as a means to enter in contact with others and manage perceived social isolation, our hypothesis needs further investigations.",

            "text": "The low mimicry response recorded in presence of food suggests that people are more focussed on live social interactions during period of conviviality linked to the feeding contexts. Since data were collected before and after meals and between the courses, when people did not have their hands engaged in food consumption, our result does not suffer the limited opportunity of people to manipulate smartphones in presence of food. Food has both biological and social functions in human societies (Dunbar 2017). Beyond the biological functions (e.g. growth, health promotion, disease prevention), food can act as a \"social cement\" (Quandt 1999) . Eating together and sharing food (e.g. happy hours, parties, working and everyday meals with colleagues, family or friends) provide both social and individual benefits across almost all human societies (Dunbar 2017). In this view, social meals are considered a \"tool\" for establishing and developing social bonds. The low mimicry response recorded in presence of food could be even more pronounced considering that our sample comes from Italy, where the culture of food is historically and intrinsically connected to social aggregation and conviviality (Helstosky 2005; Parasecoli 2004 ). It is possible that during communal eating, when people share memories and feel close to each other (Dunbar 2017), they can engage in other forms of mimicry involving facial expressions and postures (e.g. laughing together) rather that the use of objects. This hypothesis can also explain why the mimicry in the use of smartphones, contrary to other forms of facial and bodily mimicry (Palagi et al. 2020; Hess and Fischer 2013) , is not affected by the level of familiarity between subjects. Using a smartphone does not communicate any information about the internal status of the user and does not probably have any function in the synchronization of the emotional state of interacting people.",

Now that there are indications on the presence of the mimicry phenomenon involving the use of smartphones, future studies should take into account what happens in this tight time window by measuring in a more precisely way the exact timing of the mimicry response (e.g. video collection).",
