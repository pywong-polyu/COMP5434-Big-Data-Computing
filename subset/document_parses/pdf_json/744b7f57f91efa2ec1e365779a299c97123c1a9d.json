Nevertheless, techniques for quantitative assessment of the edema's severity and dynamics are absent in clinical practice, and the analysis is mainly limited to physical examination. This fact stimulates the development of novel methods for fast and reliable diagnostics of fluid retention in tissues. In this work, we focused on the possibilities of two microscopic techniques, nailfold video capillaroscopy (NVC) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), in the assessment of the short-term and long-term cutaneous edema. We showed that for the patients with HF, morphological parameters obtained by NVC-namely, the apical diameter of capillaries and the size of the perivascular zone-indicate long-term edema. On the other hand, for healthy volunteers, the application of two models of short-term edema, venous occlusion, and histamine treatment of the skin, did not reveal notable changes in the capillary parameters. However, a significant reduction of the NVC image sharpness was observed in this case, which was suggested to be due to water accumulation in the epidermis. To verify these findings, we made use of CLSM, which provides the skin structure with cellular resolution. It was observed that for the histamine-treated skin, the areas of the dermal papillae become hyporefractive, leading to the loss of contrast and the lower visibility of capillaries. Similar effect was observed for patients undergoing infusion therapy. Collectively, our results reveal the parameters can be used for pericapillary edema assessment using the NVC and CLSM, and paves the way for their application in a clinical set-up.",

Other examples of pathophysiological processes leading to edema are lymphatic dysfunction (lymphedema) [3] and inflammation [4] .",

For instance, physical examination (e.g., using the \"pitting scale\") and serial weighing remain the most used approaches for assessing edematous syndrome in HF. The review of eight clinical methods for edema quantification can be found in [5] . At the same time, numerous approaches based on different physical principles are suggested in the literature, including MRI, X-Ray computed tomography, ultrasonography, etc., which are deep tissue imaging techniques. On the other hand, a large body of work in the assessment of cutaneous edema employs optical methods, which can provide for molecular contrast, high sensitivity of detection, and are, in general, simpler. These methods include optical coherence tomography [6] , multispectral imaging [6] , optoacoustic spectroscopy [7] , diffuse reflectance spectroscopy [8] , Raman spectroscopy [9] , terahertz imaging [10] , and multiphoton imaging [11] .",

            "text": "The principles of edema assessment using optical techniques can be divided into two groups: (i) direct detection of water content using its specific spectral fingerprints-absorption (diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and multispectral imaging), or vibrational (Raman and terahertz spectroscopy) bands, and (ii) detection of edema-related morphological features (optical coherence and multiphoton tomography). Recently, we suggested using the optical microscopy-based technique, nailfold video capillaroscopy (NVC), to assess HF severity. In most studies, NVC is used to diagnose connective tissue diseases based on the parameters of the nailfold capillaries, namely, capillary density, capillary dimensions, capillary shape, and presence or absence of hemorrhages are characterized [12] . The terminology and the protocols for the description of the NVC findings are standardized in the consensus paper written by experts of the EULAR Study Group on Microcirculation in Rheumatic Diseases and the Scleroderma Clinical Trial Consortium Working Group on Capillaroscopy [12] . In [13] , one more parameter, which can be extracted from the NVC images, namely, the perivascular zone (PZ) size, has been suggested as the marker of edema, and the morphological origin of the PZ was determined using two-photon tomography. It occurred that the PZ in the NVC images, which looks like a light area surrounding the capillaries, corresponds to the viable epidermis. Next, a strong correlation was observed between the PZ size and HF severity as described by the NYHA (New York Heart Association) classification [13] . This fact was supposed to be due to the increased fluid accumulation in the viable epidermis of patients with more severe HF, experiencing the edematous syndrome. However, this hypothesis still has to be confirmed, and one of the ways to do it is to perform NVC while directly changing the amount of interstitial fluid.",

In the first case, we were inspired by the works of Kaznacheev and coauthors [14] , who suggested using a venous occlusion-based test to assess capillary permeability by analyzing hematocrit before and after the occlusion. In the case of histamine, cutaneous edema caused by capillary vasodilation occurs, and this test is often used to calibrate the methods for water content assessment (see e.g., [6] ). In addition, we made use of the confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which allows for the investigation of the skin structure with subcellular resolution. The experiment design thus included two parts: (i) induction of short-term edema under the NVC control and (ii) assessment of the morphological changes in the skin during these tests by CLSM to reveal the NVC and CLSM parameters, which can be used to quantify edema severity in a clinical set-up.",

In the CLSM images, the capillaries look like dark spots inside the grey areas, which correspond to the dermal papillae, which, in turn, are normally surrounded by the bright circular region corresponding to the melanocytes near the basal membrane [19] . Schematic representation of the dermal papilla cross-section as obtained with CLSM is presented in Figure 2c . To assess the changes in the parameters of the capillaries, we performed the following procedure. The areas of the CLSM images containing dark spots, which correspond to the capillaries, were marked with rectangles ( Figure 4a )-a representative example of the capillary image is shown in Figure 4b . Thus, the area of capillaries can be obtained and quantified from the CLSM images [20] , and in this work, we performed such quantification using the custom-made software (see Materials and Methods for details). We observed an increase in the median capillary size 1 min after venous occlusion by 10% (Figure 4c ). This increase is in agreement with the literature data, for instance, using NVC, Mathura et al. [21] observed an increase in the mean capillary diameter from 11.2 (in rest) to 12.1 mkm (during venous occlusion). However, we did not observe a significant increase in the mean capillary diameter during venous occlusion using NVC, as well as of any other parameters such as the number of perfused capillaries, capillaries shape, or the size of the PZ. The latter fact, from the point of view of the considered hypothesis, suggests that there is no fluid accumulation in the papillary layer of the dermis in the viable epidermis large enough to be revealed by NVC.

In the CLSM images, the capillaries look like dark spots inside the grey areas, which correspond to the dermal papillae, which, in turn, are normally surrounded by the bright circular region corresponding to the melanocytes near the basal membrane [19] . Schematic representation of the dermal papilla cross-section as obtained with CLSM is presented in Figure 2c . To assess the changes in the parameters of the capillaries, we performed the following procedure. The areas of the CLSM images containing dark spots, which correspond to the capillaries, were marked with rectangles ( Figure  4a )-a representative example of the capillary image is shown in Figure 4b . Thus, the area of capillaries can be obtained and quantified from the CLSM images [20] , and in this work, we performed such quantification using the custom-made software (see Materials and Methods for details). We observed an increase in the median capillary size 1 min after venous occlusion by 10% (Figure 4c ). This increase is in agreement with the literature data, for instance, using NVC, Mathura et al. [21] observed an increase in the mean capillary diameter from 11.2 (in rest) to 12.1 mkm (during venous occlusion). However, we did not observe a significant increase in the mean capillary diameter during venous occlusion using NVC, as well as of any other parameters such as the number of perfused capillaries, capillaries shape, or the size of the PZ.

Figure 6a demonstrates typical capillary images acquired at 100\u00d7 magnification before and after histamine application to the nailfold region. The kinetics of decrease and increase of image sharpness is shown in Figure 6b . After the histamine application (vertical dashed line in Figure 6b ), image sharpness rapidly decreased twofold, and then gradually reached the initial level. From the results, we came to the following conclusions: (1) long-term edema, e.g., in patients with HF, results in the increase of the PZ size, without visible alteration of the sharpness of the NVC images (Figure 3a) , and, contrary to that, (2) short-term edema, e.g., caused by histamine-induced vasodilatation, does not increase the PZ size but rather decreases the sharpness of the NVC images ( Figures 5 and 6 ). While the later conclusion is important for quantitative interpretation of the NVC data when assessing edema, the diagnostic value of the image sharpness has to be further verified. To do this, we performed a preliminary study of patients undergoing infusion therapy. The idea of this experiment was to observe the short-term pericapillary edema, which could be caused by large infusion volumes (3L). The results of the experiment are shown in Figure 7 : indeed, we observed a significant decrease in the NVC image sharpness after infusion, thus indicating the emergence of pronounced short-term edema. Hence, the image sharpness can be used as a diagnostic parameter to quantify the dynamics of pericapillary edema, e.g., in patients undergoing infusion therapy.

It was observed that along with the edema emergence, the sharpness of the image decreased significantly, and this change was reversible. Hence, the sharpness of the NVC images is directly related to the water content in the epidermis-this fact is logical considering the fact that the light propagation, light penetration depth, and imaging contrast in tissues is mainly determined by light scattering, which, in turn, depends on the difference of the refractive index between the structures in the skin [22] . That is, the process of optical clearing, which allows improving the image contrast, is based on the idea to decrease the difference in the refractive index between the cells and extracellular space, e.g., by replacing water molecules with the clearing agent [23] . Notably, in a number of papers dealing with NVC, the \"cloudy\" appearance of the images is referred to as an indicator of edema [15] [16] [17] [18] ; for instance, in the recent paper on the COVID-19 microvascular involvement, pericapillary edema signs are described as a \"foggy appearance around capillaries due to fluids build-up\" [15] .

At the same time, here we suggest another parameter, NVC image sharpness, which occurred to correlate with the edema emergence both in model experiments ( Figures 5 and 6 ), as well as in a clinical set-up (Figure 7 , patients undergoing infusion therapy). Although the image sharpness seems to be of no diagnostic value in the case of HF (Figure 3a) , it proved to be a promising tool for quantification of the short-term edema in dynamics. ",
