In this study, we investigated the protective effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on intimal hyperplasia and VSMC proliferation and migration, and the underlying mechanisms by which these events occur. A rat unilateral carotid artery was ligated to induce vascular injury and the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles were determined using miRNA microarray analysis. We observed that UDCA significantly reduced the degree of intimal hyperplasia and induced miR-21 dysregulation. Restoration of miR-21 by agomir-miR-21 reversed the protective effects of UDCA on intimal hyperplasia and proliferation in vivo. In vitro, UDCA suppressed PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation, invasion and migration in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the suppressive effect of UDCA was abrogated by overexpression of miR-21 in PDGF-BB-incubated VSMCs. Furthermore, we identified that miR-21 in VSMCs targeted the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a tumor suppressor gene, negatively modulated the AKT/mTOR pathway. More importantly, we observed that that UDCA suppressed AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the carotid artery injury model, whereas this pathway was reactivated by overexpression of miR-21. Taken together, our findings indicated that UDCA inhibited intimal hyperplasia and VSMCs excessive migration and proliferation via blocking miR-21/PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which suggests that UDCA may be a promising candidate for the therapy of atherosclerosis.",

In normal blood vessel, VSMCs reside within the media and remain quiescent. After stimulation with atherogenic factors, VSMCs proliferate and migrate from the media to the intima, which ultimately results in intimal hyperplasia and vascular stenosis [3] . Thus, therapeutic strategies against VSMC proliferation and migration may be beneficial for treating VSMC-related pathological conditions. In response to vascular injury, activated VSMCs, platelets and inflammatory cells release the growth factors, especially platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), thereby cause a change of VSMCs from a contractile phenotype to a synthetic phenotype [4, 5] . PDGF-BB is considered to be the most potent stimulants for VSMC proliferation and migration [6] ; therefore, PDGF-BB was used in this study to induce these VSMC reactions.",

UDCA has cytoprotective activity, such as anti-apoptotic and antiinflammatory effects, but these effects have previously been described only in hepatocytes. Recently, Taurin-conjugated ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a taurine-conjugate derivative of UDCA, has been reported to attenuate neointimal hyperplasia by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in the VSMCs of rats subjected to carotid artery balloon injury [9] . Although both UDCA and TUDCA, two naturally occurring bile acids, have been already approved for clinical use for treatment of several cholestatic diseases, there are still some distinct effects of them since the difference in their hydrophility and affinity to cell receptors [10, 11] . As compared to TUDCA, UDCA exerts antiatherogenic effect on disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis by repressing inflammatory response and endoplasmic reticulum stress [12] ; however, whether UDCA might act similarly of TUDCA on intimal hyperplasia and the underlying mechanisms by which these events occur remains unclear.",

It has been widely reported that miRNAs are involved in a variety of biological and pathological processes, including cellular apoptosis, proliferation, migration and carcinogenesis [13, 15, 16] . One recent study has demonstrated that the expression of at least 20-30% of human proteincoding genes is regulated by miRNAs [17] . Another study has revealed that miRNAs are highly expressed in the cardiovascular system and some miRNAs are dysregulated in diseased vessels [18] . miRNAs have been documented to function as essential regulators of atherosclerosis by regulating crucial factors or key pathways [19] . A recent study reported that UDCA improves rat liver regeneration by modulating miR-21 levels after partial hepatectomy [20] . Castro et al. have also confirmed that UDCA modulated the disease severity in human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease via inhibiting miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway [21] . Inspired by these studies, we speculated that UDCA might exert anti-intimal hyperplasia effect on atherosclerosis through regulating miRNA expression.",

At the end of experiments, the rats were sacrificed by overdose of pentobarbital sodium (150 mg/kg, iv), and carotid arteries were collected for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or immunohistochemical staining and molecular biological analyse [25, 26] . Experiment 2: miR-21 agomir (agomir-miR-21) experiments. The rats were randomly divided into two groups: Injury + UDCA + agomir-miR-21/ agomir-NC group (n = 10 each group), the vascular injury rats were injected intraperitoneally with UDCA (100 mg/kg/d body weight), and then injected with agomir-miR-21/agomir-NC (8 mg/ kg) via tail vein in 0.2 ml saline. Agomir-miR-21/ agomir-NC were designed and synthesized by RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). The carotid arteries were snap-frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.",

Previous studies revealed that various types of drugs, such as Tongxinluo [31] and Emodin [32] , inhibited neointimal hyperplasia in animal model of vascular injury by regulating miRNAs expression. Inspired by these studies, we hypothesized whether UDCA improved neointimal hyperplasia by regulating microRNA. First, we conducted a microarray analysis to measure the miRNA expression profiles in rat carotid arteries tissues. As shown in Figure 2 (a), compared with sham group, a large set of miRNAs were ectopic expressions in injured carotid arteries. Interestingly, miR-21, miR-221, miR-let-7a, and miR-495 screened from our microarray analyses have been previously reported to modulate VSMC proliferation and migration and increase neointima hyperplasia in an animal model of vascular injury [30, [33] [34] [35] [36] . To further explore whether UDCA inhibited neointimal hyperplasia via modulating these miRNAs expression, we used qRT-PCR to determine the miR-495, miR-221, miR-21 and miR-495 level in the rat carotid arterial injury model after UDCA treatment. We observed that UDCA markedly inhibited miR-21 expression in injury + UDCA group compared with that in injury group (Figure 2(b) ; P < 0.01); whereas, the levels of miR-495, miR-221, and miR-495 level did not change. These data suggested that UDCA might attenuate intimal hyperplasia in the carotid artery injury model through modulating miR-21 expression.",

To verify this bioinformatic predication, we constructed luciferase reporter plasmids containing the wt or mut 3\u02b9-UTR segments of PTEN (Figure 6(a) ). The reporters were co-transfected with either miR-21 mimics/inhibitor or corresponding NC to VSMCs, and the luciferase activity was measured. These experiments showed that miR-21 mimics significantly decreased the relative luciferase activity compared with mimic NC, while miR-21 inhibitor resulted in an opposite effect in the presence of the wildtype 3\u02b9-UTR (P < 0.01; Figure 6 (b)). Expectedly, miR-21 mimics/inhibitor failed to modulate the relative luciferase activity of vector containing mut PTEN-3\u02b9-UTR in the miR-21-binding site ( Figure 6(b) ). Western blot analysis further confirmed that overexpression or inhibition of miR-21 obviously ether downregulated or upregulated, respectively, the PTEN protein level in VSMCs transfected with either miR-21 mimics/inhibitor or corresponding NC (Figure 6(c) ). To further determine whether the PTEN level is modulated by UDCA in PDGF-BB-incubated VSMCs, the VSMCs were pretreated with 10 \u03bcM, 50 \u03bcM, 200 \u03bcM UDCA for 6 h followed by stimulation with PDGF-BB for 24 h, and the PTEN level was measured using Western blot analysis. We observed that treatment of VSMCs with PDGF-BB dramatically reduced the PTEN, whereas UDCA treatment increased PDGF-BB-induced PTEN downregulation in VSMCs in a dosedependent manner (P < 0.01; Figure 6(d) ). These results demonstrated that miR-21 inhibited PTEN expression by directly targeting its 3\u02b9-UTR in PDGF-BB-incubated VSMCs.",

In this study, our results demonstrated that UDCA ameliorated intimal hyperplasia and the excessive proliferation and invasion of VSMCs in the rat carotid artery injury model. In addition, our results identified that UDCA suppressed the formation of hyperplastic neointima in injured carotid arteries via inhibiting miR-21 expression. More importantly, our findings indicated that UDCA exerted the inhibitory effects on intimal hyperplasia both in vitro and in vivo via blocking miR-21/PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. UDCA, a tertiary bile acid, is the most widely used therapeutic agent for the treatment of hepatopathies, including primary biliary cirrhosis [45] . It has also been reported that UDCA might be beneficial in atherosclerotic vascular disease. For example, Von Haehling et al. have demonstrated that UDCA improves endothelial function, as evaluated by flow mediated vasodilation in patients with chronic heart failure [46] . UDCA was also identified to inhibit inflammatory response and endoplasmic reticulum stress in disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis [12] . In this study, we established a rat model of vascular injury used by unilateral carotid artery ligation and investigated the effects of UDCA on the formation of hyperplastic neointima. Our results showed that UDCA dramatically decreased neointimal area and the ratio of neointimal area to media area in injured carotid arteries. In addition, injection of UDCA resulted in the downregulation of PCNA, a cellular proliferation marker, downregulation. These results indicated that UDCA attenuate intimal hyperplasia and cell proliferation in injured carotid arteries. miRNAs act as critical regulators of gene expression that exert their activity by regulating target mRNA stability or translation efficiency [47] . A recent study has demonstrated that UDCA improves rat liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy by regulating miRNAs expression [20] . Moreover, UDCA has been reported to regulate the severity of human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by inhibiting miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway [21] ; therefore, we hypothesized that UDCA exerts the suppressive effect on intimal hyperplasia by modulating miRNAs expression. In this study, miRNA microarray analysis showed that a large set of miRNAs was differently expressed in injured carotid arteries using microarray assay. Among these aberrant miRNAs, miR-495, miR-221 and miR-21 were upregulated, and let-7a was downregulated in rat carotid arteries tissues, indicating the reliability of our microarray. A previous study reported that inhibition of miR-495 has beneficial effects on lesion formation, intimal hyperplasia and plasma cholesterol levels in experimental restenosis model [36] . Liu et al. found that knockdown of miR-221 in rat carotid arteries suppressed VSMC proliferation in vivo and neointimal lesion formation after angioplasty [30] . Cao et al. proved that upregulation of let-7a inhibits VSMCs proliferation in vitro and in vein graft intimal hyperplasia in rats model [48] . To validate whether UDCA inhibits intimal hyperplasia by modulating these miRNAs, miR-21, miR-221, miR-let-7a and miR-495 were assessed in rat carotid arteries tissues. We observed that UDCA significantly inhibited the upregulation of injuryinduced miR-21; whereas miR-495, miR-221 and miR-495 levels did not change in rat carotid arteries tissues. Moreover, our results revealed that restoration of miR-21 by agomir-miR-21 reversed the protective effects of UDCA in vivo on hyperplastic neointima. These data indicated that UDCA repressed intimal hyperplasia in the carotid artery injury model via inhibiting miR-21 expression.",

This phenotypic change increased VSMC proliferation and migration, which is one of the critical cellular events in the development of atherosclerosis [45, 49] . To investigate the UDCA effect in VSMCs, we established the VSMC model and induced proliferation and invasion using PDGF-BB. We observed that UDCA treatment ameliorated PDGF-BB-induced proliferation, invasion and migration of VSMCs in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, miR-21 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of UDCA on PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation and metastasis. These results of our investigation of the effects of PDGF-BB on VSMCs suggested that UDCA exerts the suppressive effects on PDGF-BBinduced VSMC proliferation and metastasis by blocking miR-21 level; however, the molecular mechanism by which UDCA inhibits proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo are not completely understood.",

Another recent study has demonstrated that miR-21 is upregulated in the vascular wall after balloon injury and mediates cell proliferation and apoptosis by downregulating PTEN and Bcl-2 [59] . The results of our current study further confirmed that miR-21 suppresses the PTEN by directly targeting its 3\u02b9-UTR in VSMCs. More importantly, our data validated that UDCA suppressed PTEN/AKT/ mTOR signaling pathway in vivo by repressing miR-21 level. Taken together, our findings indicated that UDCA suppressed intimal hyperplasia in vivo by blocking miR-21/PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",
