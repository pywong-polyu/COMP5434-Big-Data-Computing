Around 90% of non-inflammatory PCLs are intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), mucinous cystic neoplasms and serous cystadenomas [3] . In surgical studies, IPMNs represent the most frequent premalignant PCLs and about 50% of all resected pancreatic cysts [6, 7] . They are topographically classified according to their relation with the main pancreatic duct (MPD), with progression to invasive cancer in 42-48% of the main duct-IPMNs and mixed type-IPMNs, and 11-26% of the BD-IPMNs [5, 6, 8, 9] . Apart from the malignant degeneration of an IPMN into an invasive carcinoma, the rate of concomitant carcinoma in the presence of an IPMN can be as high as 4.4% to 11.2% of patients [10] [11] [12] .",

Thin section, high-resolution, contrast-enhanced CT was found to provide enough details regarding the structure of PCLs to make a diagnosis [40] and Lee, J. et al. recently declared MRI and CT to be interchangeable for assessment and follow-up of patients with PCLs [41] . For patients refusing an MRI, pancreatic CT is the recommended alternative modality according to the societies ICG, ACG and ESG [32] , and offers a comparable accuracy to MRCP in terms of PCL characterization [42] . However, we recognize the high diagnostic value of other modalities such as multi-parametric MRI, MRCP, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) [4, 32, 43, 44] . Consequently, even though our model provides help for the detection of PCLs on CT, models for other modalities would be useful for their accurate characterization.",

Second, due to the lack of external validation, we cannot make a clear statement on the performance of our algorithm on external data. However, given the high degree of standardization of CT protocols, we do not expect a major drop in performance. Third, main duct-IPMN were not included in the training as the sample size was too small and their morphologic presentation is too different from other PCLs. Fourth, the first step (segmentation of the pancreas) failed in 44 cases, which has a negative impact on direct clinical implementability. Possible remedies are to improve the organ segmentation algorithm using more training data or adding a verification step of the first algorithm's output (\"whole pancreas included in the scan or not?\"), e.g., by a third algorithm. Having exclusively confronted our model with a pre-screened set of examinations containing PCLs and excluding pancreatitis and tumorous pancreas, the amount of FPs might increase when used in a clinical setting, which constitutes the fifth limitation of this study.",
