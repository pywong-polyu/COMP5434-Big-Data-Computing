At present, the supply mode of public rental housing in China is mainly government construction and operation, which has the problems of low supply efficiency and low service level. It is critical to explore an efficient supply model in the construction of the GSRH system. erefore, this study, starting from the three supply subjects of government, market, and society, constructs an evolutionary game model and uses agent-based modelling simulation to explore how multisubjects achieve optimal collaboration in the supply process of GSRH. e results are as follows: First, the development of a collaborative supply system includes four stages: noncooperative behaviour, collaborative exploration, collaborative game, and three-subject collaborative supply. Second, the government is the core of realising multisubject coordination. Increasing government supervision will boost market participation, while increasing government subsidies can fully mobilise the enthusiasm of social subjects but cannot continuously improve the market's enthusiasm. ird, increasing the participation ratio of social subjects will help mobilise the enthusiasm of other subjects to participate, while the excessive participation ratio of market subjects may cause an imbalance in the collaborative supply system.",

Owing to the lack of housing affordability, the housing needs of this group are mainly concentrated in rental housing. However, for a long time, China's real estate market and housing security system have emphasised sales over rent, the housing rental market has not been fully developed, the structure of supply and demand is unbalanced, and the large-scale rental market has not been supported by special policies. erefore, the new citizen group has become a \"sandwich layer\" group that neither is within the coverage of public rental housing (PRH) nor can afford commercial housing, bearing the housing pressure and crowding-out effect caused by high housing prices [3] ; thus, it is a prominent problem that they cannot afford to buy a house or rent a good house at the present stage [4, 5] . To compensate for the obvious shortcomings of the housing security system and break the housing dilemma of the new citizens, in July 2021, the General Office of the State Council issued the \"Opinions on Accelerating the Development of Government-subsidized Rental Housing (GSRH),\" which clearly proposed the concept of GSRH in the top-level design of the housing security system [6] . However, the current policy only proposes the basic concept of GSRH, and scholars and policymakers still need in-depth discussions on supply subjects and supply models.",

GSRH is mainly used to solve the housing difficulties of the new citizen group to make up for the institutional innovation of China's previous imperfect housing security system for the same group. In terms of supply mode, GSRH reconstructs a market-oriented and policy-supported security system and guides multisubject investment and multichannel financing of \"small-sized, lowrent\" rental housing. GSRH is an important measure with Chinese characteristics that promotes the steady development of the real estate market and stabilises the position of \"housing not for speculation.\" e single supply of the government subject has problems such as the obvious funding gap, the prominent contradiction between supply and demand, and weak construction enthusiasm caused by a one-sided view of political achievements. At present, the group of new citizens is large, and the shortage of rental housing is obvious. It is necessary for the housing security subject to change from government-based participation to the joint participation of the government, enterprises, and social forces to improve the efficiency and quality of supply. According to the policy background of GSRH, the supply subjects can be divided into government and nongovernmental institutions, in which the former refers to the public sector of local housing management institutions, while the latter are further divided into profit-oriented market subjects (including housing rental franchise enterprises, real estate development enterprises, and property service companies) and nonprofit social subjects (including large private enterprises, state-owned enterprises and institutions, industrial parks, research institutes, and rural collectives). e supply subject can be further abstracted as government, market, and society. erefore, this study focuses on how to cooperate with the government, market, and social subjects to participate in the rapid and effective supply of GSRH in large cities.

Using nongovernmental resources can create a more flexible structure to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments [23] . Public-private partnerships (PPP) are widely seen as a way to involve the private sector with rich capital and management experience in sharing the financial burden of governments and improving the efficiency and sustainability of the public housing supply [24, 25] . In Austria, the UK, and Italy, innovative mixed arrangements for the development, financing, and management of indemnificatory housing jointly developed by the state, the third sector, market, and community participants show that they can benefit from the participation of market participants and communities [26] . Around 2011, the central government launched an initiative to encourage local governments to cooperate with nongovernmental organisations in providing public housing [27] . Reference [28] evaluated the feasibility of PPP in social housing. Reference [23] studied the structure and mechanism of the role played by nongovernmental actors in public housing governance.",

However, a research gap exists with regard to how a collaborative government, market, and society can supply PRH. In the complex, self-adaptive system of multisubject supply of GSRH, the plan chosen by any subject of the government, market, and society affects the interests of other subjects, and the relationship between different subjects may lead to different supply results. Behaviour is also influenced, to some extent, by the surrounding environment [29, 30] ; therefore, it is not enough to only observe the participants in the research on the multisubject supply of GSRH and, more importantly, the research on the relationship between the participants and the interaction with the system environment [31] . e supply of GSRH by the government, market, and society is a science about collaboration. German scholar Haken proposed the synergy concept in system theory, which meant a subsystem's collaboration, cooperation, synchronous combined effect, and collective behaviour in the system, that the whole realised the effect via nonlinearity complex interaction among the subsystem which the individual cannot realise to produce the 1 + 1 > 2 collaborative effect [32] . In the supply process, this synergy system is dynamic; that is, various factors influence each other through a relationship that is not only collaborative but also evolutionary [33] . erefore, the supply of GSRH by government, market, and society is based on the coevolution theory. e coevolution theory follows the general analytical framework of Darwinism, which specifies the replicators and interactors in detail, and uses the \"variation,\" \"replication,\" and \"selection\" to describe the process of coevolution [34] . Evolutionary game theory (EGT) provides a useful method for Darwin's competition by defining a framework of competition, strategy, and analysis model [35] .",

As quasipublic good, the supply of GSRH cannot and does not need to be fully borne by the government; however, as the executive department of state power, the government is fully responsible for guiding the supply of GSRH and has always been one of the main suppliers. Government participants rely on hierarchical guidance, mainly acting as nonprofit entities [23] . For the supply of GSRH, the state is at the top of the hierarchy, with the central government setting national supply policies and tasks and local governments acting as intermediaries responsible for establishing specific methods for local policy, project development and implementation, and negotiating with other actors to achieve housing construction and distribution [17, 50] . e authority and systematic organisation of government subjects can successfully promote the construction of GSRH, strengthen public services, ensure fair supply, and stabilise economic development. Moreover, the government subject is a key intermediary connecting other subjects [51] . e market subject refers to profit-making organisations that raise funds by themselves, including housing rental franchise enterprises, real estate development enterprises, property service companies, and others capable of directly or indirectly participating in the supply of GSRH. Market players use commercial principles to achieve efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation in providing public goods and social services [52] . e participation of market players reduces government costs and improves supply efficiency and supply effect. Moreover, it can avoid the psychological label effect of the centralised construction of GSRH on the security objects and achieve the goal of coordinating the layout of GSRH and ordinary commodity housing. e market subject is a key participant in effective supply; however, it is usually subject to the profit trend [19] . Compared with commercial projects, participation in GSRH projects has fewer returns and is not attractive to the market, and market subjects thus need certain incentives from the government. e incentive policies and measures are many, including reducing loan interest rates and providing tax relief and cheap or free land [2] . e social subject refers to nonprofit organisations that participate in supply on the principle of voluntary and mutual assistance. In China, these are large private enterprises, state-owned enterprises and institutions, industrial parks and rural collectives, and others. ey build or reconstruct GSRH through self-construction, joint ventures, and shares or in other ways, using collectively operated construction land, idle land owned by enterprises and institutions, supporting land for industrial parks, and stock of idle houses. e social subject connects governments, collectives, and individuals and plays a complementary and balanced role in the multiagent collaborative supply system. Compared with government departments, social organisations are independent of the government system, which can get rid of the fixed pattern of the bureaucratic structure of government organisations and form their own unique diversity and flexibility, thus bringing low cost and high efficiency of supply. At the same time, it can effectively compensate for the lack of efficiency caused by the government's single supply or privatisation production mode. Compared with the private sector, the nonprofit goal of social organisations to participate in GSRH supply determines its more public welfare, the pursuit of high quality, and the efficiency of affordable rental housing supply.",

In addition, they generally maintain idle houses or land, and the construction costs are also small. erefore, it is believed that C M > C S . e supervision cost generated in the process of government intervention is S M as the market subject and S S as the social subject. Considering that the supply object of the social subject is unit workers, the supply quality directly affects the unit's operation efficiency through residential satisfaction, the self-discipline level of high-quality supply is high, and the difficulty and cost of government regulation are low; thus, it is assumed that S M > S S .

With the help of this platform, this study establishes the attributes of each subject, the number of agents in each subject, the selection mechanism of game objects, and the strategy update mechanism, and it compiles the government-market-society, three-agent game simulation programme. rough NetLogo, large-scale numerical experiments are conducted to show the dynamic game process of different subjects under different parameter conditions, verify the evolutionary game model of multiagent synergistic supply of GSRH, realise the simulation and effect evaluation of relevant parameter and subject strategy selection changes, and provide verification for the effectiveness of policy recommendations.",

Strategy learning mechanisms: since the agent is and asymmetrical information, it is not strictly based on the principle of maximum utility to make decisions in the game. According to the view of biological evolution and replication dynamics, the subject with lower returns continues to learn, imitate, and compare different strategies, then chooses a strategy higher than the expected return of this strategy, always replaces the unsatisfied strategy with a satisfied one, and finally tends to a stable state [38, 57] . e agent takes the result of each game as the actual benefit of its strategic interaction and then compares it with the expected benefit of the two strategies at the same time to judge whether the strategy of the t-period is optimal and whether to update it.",

Among them, Scenario 1 corresponds to the stage of noncooperative behaviour, in which the central government has a low level of control over the supply of GSRH, and local governments are more inclined to transfer investment to other projects that can generate considerable fiscal revenue. In Scenarios 2-4, the central government's control is still insufficient, local governments still choose a nonintervention strategy, and the benefits of participation by the market or social subject are greater than nonparticipation. Based on the quasipublic goods properties of GSRH, the government subject is the core of the GSRH supply, and the market and social subject cannot actively participate in it without the government's guidance; therefore, Scenarios 2-4 represent an invalid exploration stage. As the central government further intensifies its control over the GSRH supply, the government subject begins to choose the intervention strategy; thus, the supply system enters the collaborative exploration stage, corresponding to Scenario 5. In the process of exploring the intervention strategy of the government subject, intervention strategies are constantly adjusted to attract social or market subject to participate in supply, and the collaborative system enters the collaborative game stage, corresponding to Scenarios 6-7. In the collaborative game among government, market, and society, the three subjects constantly adjust their strategy choices and finally reach the collaborative supply stage of government intervention, market, and social participation, corresponding to Scenario 8. Given that GSRH is a kind of social welfare housing without government policy support and guidance, other subjects do not take the initiative to participate in the driving force. erefore, the invalid exploration stage without the participation of the government subject is only a theoretical derivation result, which is not in line with the realistic logic of affordable rental housing supply and will not be discussed in subsequent research.",

According to the statistical yearbook, in 2019, there were 2,792 county-level administrative regions, 94,790 real estate enterprises (except state-owned and collective investment enterprises), and 20,486 state-owned enterprises and institutions (in all industries) [60] .

With the decrease in the proportion of government agents taking intervention strategies, the probability of market and social agents taking that strategy tends to 0 at an approximate rate, as shown in Figure 3(a) . When the central government pays more attention to the supply of GSRH and takes it as an important indicator for the performance evaluation or urban development of the government subject, the government subject tends to adopt the intervention strategy at a high rate, and the supply system of the city enters the stage of collaborative exploration. As the government subject has bounded rationality and obtains incomplete information in this phase, the enthusiasm of the market and social subjects to participate in the supply is not aroused; therefore, they will tend to adopt the nonparticipation strategy with a probability of 1 at a similar rate, as shown in Figure 3(b) .

In the collaborative supply stage (Stage 4), as the participation rate of social agents increases, the market participation rate fluctuates, but the change is not significant, while the government intervention rate clearly increases, as shown in Figure 7 (e). e impact on the strategy choice of each agent in other stages is not significant. e simulation results show that the increase of the proportion of social participation helps to mobilise the enthusiasm of market participants in the collaborative game stage and the government agents to intervene in the collaborative supply stage. erefore, in the process of collaborative supply system development, mobilising the participation enthusiasm of social agents is conducive to the positive development of the collaborative supply system.",

First, the collaborative supply of GSRH can be divided into four stages: (i) noncooperative behaviour, (ii) collaborative exploration, (iii) collaborative game, and (iv) three-subject collaborative supply. Our division of the development stages of the multisubject collaborative supply system fills the gap of systematic research on the multisubject collaborative supply of public housing. e policy simulation of the four stages shows that the government is at the core of realising a multisubject collaborative supply, and the solution to housing affordability cannot rely solely on market forces.",

            "text": "is result confirms the previous research conclusion on the important role of government subjects in the supply of affordable housing [26] . In the context of neoliberalism, Australia's study of the housing crises in Sydney and Melbourne also suggests that local governments must play a bigger role [61] . e policy's experimental findings further confirm the important role of specific political and economic incentives for local governments in achieving programmes [17] . e government should provide appropriate guidance for the market and social subjects, and it should be cautious in the intervention process. Improper intervention may create an uncontrollable and uncertain environment that affects market efficiency and fairness [62, 63] . And the government should determine the corresponding intervention measures according to the matching of supply and demand of GSRH in each city and the development stage of collaborative supply system so as to maximise the social benefits of these incentive mechanisms and ensure the financial feasibility of the market and social subjects [64] . Second, as the link for realising market and social synergy, how the government can efficiently realise the supply of GSRH is critical to the sustainable development of public housing at the stage of collaborative supply. e government's supervision and guidance strategy on the market and social subjects is equivalent to the \"carrot\" and \"stick\" initiative. A previous study discussed the feasibility of introducing housing affordability contributions and incentives when developers entered the planning process and pointed out that optimum scenarios identified a balance of carrots and sticks [64] . Based on the previous related research, combined with the development stage of the collaborative GSRH supply system, this study determines the government's supervision and guidance of market and social subjects in different development stages of the supply system and obtains more detailed results. e incentive measures applicable to the supply of GSRH in all cities do not exist. erefore, in the process of realising the multisubject collaborative supply of public housing, the development stage of the collaborative supply system should be determined according to the basic situation of the city, such as the specific population, economic situation, and policy background, combined with the exploration of the multisubject collaborative model of the city, such as public-private partnerships and inclusionary housing. And then, the specific supply policy applicable to the city should be determined according to the development stage of the collaborative supply system and the national support policy. Finally, affordable housing is increasingly developed, financed, and managed by a mix of state, third sector, market, and community actors. Previous studies on publicprivate cooperation have focused more on the significance of cooperation among government and private and nonprofit organisations in increasing the supply of indemnificatory housing [26, 65] , and private real estate developers have entered into partnerships with the Housing Authority to finance, design, build, and manage the new developments [66, 67] . Based on previous studies, through large-scale policy simulation experiments, this study draws microscopic and more instructive conclusions and discusses the positive and negative effects of different participation ratios of the market and social subjects in the multisubject, collaborative supply. For the different development stages of the collaborative GSRH supply system, the different initial strategy choices of the market and social agents have different degrees of influence on the development of each stage. In different stages, reasonable control of the proportion of the market and social subjects choosing participation strategies is conducive to the balance of the collaborative supply system and to avoid an imbalance caused by the insufficient or excessive participation enthusiasm of market and social subjects.",

(a) Market agents are sensitive to the government's choice of supervision strategy. e government should adopt different levels of supervision strategies at different stages of the development of the collaborative supply system (Stages I-II: supervision; Stage III: increased supervision; Stage IV: supervision), but government supervision is not a key factor affecting the participation of social subjects in supply. erefore, the government can appropriately increase the supervision of the market and relax the supervision of social subjects in the process of coordination. (b) For the choice of subsidy strategy, the reaction of market agents to the intensity of the government's subsidy strategy has certain limits, beyond which the increase of government subsidies cannot mobilise the market's enthusiasm, while increasing subsidies to social agents can fully mobilise their participation enthusiasm. erefore, the government should appropriately increase subsidies to market subject and give full subsidies to social subject. Finally, the results of the policy simulation experiment indicate that increasing the participation ratio of social agents helps mobilise the enthusiasm of the government and of market agents to participate in Stage III. However, the excessive participation ratio of market agents leads to the imbalance of the collaborative supply system in Stage IV; thus, the government subject needs to limit the market participation ratio within a reasonable range.",
