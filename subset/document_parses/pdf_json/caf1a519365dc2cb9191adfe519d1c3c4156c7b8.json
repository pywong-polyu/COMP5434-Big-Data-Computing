This condition results in \"Panic Buying\", because everyone tries to avoid the spread and transmission of the COVID-19 disease by doing various ways, one of which is by taking additional supplements such as vitamin C and probiotic supplements. Materials and Methods: The materials used were mice Mus musculus male DDY strain aged 1-2 months. Probiotic supplement Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14 with a viability of 1 \u00d7 10 8 CFU/ml. with a weight of 0.16 grams dissolved in 0.25 ml 0.9% NaCl. Vitamin C used is a commercial vitamin C tablet, weighing 0.06 grams in 0.25 ml 0.9% NaCl. Meanwhile, the feed for mice (Mus musculus) is a complete feed from Pokphand with the code BR1 CP511B. Lung histology preparations data were analysed descriptively and statistically through the test Chi square while the data on the number of lymphocytes were analysed descriptively. Results: The histological observations of lungs of Mus musculus showed that in the treatment of ML, MV, and MKA test was carried out chi square ratio between the groups that did not have lymphocyte infiltration and those that had lymphocyte infiltration showed a significant difference (p <0.05). Meanwhile, the results of the lymphocyte count showed that ML and MV treatment was higher than that of MK treatment. Conclusion: It is suggested that the administration of probiotics can stimulate and modulate the respiratory immune system. immune system, namely by the presence of lymphocyte infiltration and a higher number of lymphocytes than without consumption of probiotic supplements. This meant that the consumption of probiotic supplements can also improve the respiratory immune system in humans.",

This condition results in \"Panic Buying\", because everyone tries to avoid the spread and transmission of the COVID-19 disease by doing various ways, one of which is by taking additional supplements such as vitamin C and probiotic supplements (1) . Probiotic supplements are supplements that can be used to protect and maintain the health of the digestive system, especially the stomach and intestines (2) . Microorganisms have actually been widely used for a long time, both in the food and health industries. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), probiotic strains, which are a group of lactic acid bacteria, if consumed in sufficient quantities can provide health benefits for the body (3) . The bacterial species that were first used as probiotics were Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum (4) . Several studies state that L. acidophilus besides having anti-diarrhoea ability, also has a function as an immunomodulator or enhances the body's immune system so that it can prevent disease infections in both animals and humans (5, 6) .",

Therefore, various types of drugs have been developed which selectively inhibit or intensify immune cell populations and subpopulations. Immunomodulators cause measurable changes in immune function. Immunomodulators affect cells that produce dissolved mediators such as cytokines (10) . Immunosuppressants can inhibit the immune response in organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases such as pemphigus, lupus and / or allergies (11, 12) . Meanwhile, immunostimulants increase the immune response in infectious diseases, tumors, primary or secondary immunodeficiency, and changes in antibody transfer (13) . Immunomodulators can work specifically and not specifically. The specific action of immunomodulators affects the immune system due to the presence of certain antigens or immunogens, with selective specificity for the immune response (10) . Immunomodulation is selective when stimulation is interpreted as an immune reaction to one or several antigens, for example the response to vaccine administration (14) . The non-specific action of immunomodulators is used to stimulate or suppress immune responses, without directing stimulated cell activity to specific antigens. They are divided into three types: type I, acting on the normal immune system; type II, works on a suppressed immune system; and type III, acting on a normal functioning immune system and immunosuppression.",

In addition, probiotics can also normalize the body barrier in respiration, regulate inflammatory mediators that also increase the development of the immune system, and stimulate an immune response (16) . Apart from acting as immunosuppressants, probiotic bacteria can also strengthen the immune system because of the help of mucus (17) . The adherence of probiotics to the mucus was caused by a protein substance that was owned by the probiotic. This substance was called \"mucus-binding protein\" (mucus binding protein), which was found in higher numbers in lactic acid-producing bacteria, with the presence of this protein probiotic bacteria can attach to the mucus and interact with the host (18) .",

Therefore, the organic vitamin C from natural ingredients or pure vitamin C supplements as ascorbic acid can be more effective when consumed with a nutritionally balanced diet compared to only taking vitamin C supplements without considering the intake of other nutrients to increase and maintain the body's immunity. Vitamin C supplements alone can only be effective when there were free radicals. Therefore, they can immediately react with free radicals. This results in the treatment of lymphocyte infiltration still occurring even though it was still at levels 1 and 2. In the same control treatment with vitamin C treatment, there was lymphocyte infiltration in lung tissue at levels 1 and 2. These results indicated that in normal conditions without additional supplement treatment, the body responds to the disturbance by the occurrence of an inflammatory process characterized by lymphocyte infiltration.",
