All three patients were imaged 1-5 days post-vaccination for unrelated MSK shoulder symptoms, and none reported any symptoms besides mild shoulder discomfort for a day or two following vaccine administration. All three patients demonstrated characteristic deltoid edema, quadrilateral space region edema and axillary nodal prominence. Vessel prominence with T2 and T1 increased signal draining to the approximate location of the 2 quadrilateral space and axilla was an associated feature. The normal appearance of the COVID-19 vaccine on shoulder MRI has not been previously described, and recognition by the radiologist will prevent erroneous differential diagnosis, unnecessary medical workups, and detract from the clinically relevant pathological imaging findings in patients with shoulder pain.",

Serious side effects are very unusual. Unliteral axillary adenopathy (and less commonly cervical adenopathy) has been reported following COVID vaccination, causing a particular diagnostic dilemma for breast radiologists and oncologists [6] . This axillary adenopathy has been estimated to generally resolved in 5 weeks [7] .

There is a paucity of literature on lymphatic drainage of the right upper extremity and particularly of the deltoid [14] . The adjacent triangular intramuscular space has been described as a lymphatic station for upper back melanoma metastasis [15] . It is possible the inflammation we have described as centered in the quadrilateral space involves some of the adjacent spaces as definitive boundaries may be challenging by imaging. In our reported cases, patient 1 was [16, 17] . All three patients demonstrated vessel prominence with increased T2 and unusual ill-defined increased T1 signal in some of the larger vessels extending from the deltoid region to the approximate region of the quadrilateral space. (Figures 1-3) All three patients demonstrated diffuse increased T2 signal in the deltoid muscle consistent with edema/inflammation and the direct injection of the COVID vaccine (Figures 1-3 ). Imaging features of this vaccine inflammatory reaction in the deltoid could be erroneously interpreted as strain, tear, myositis, or denervation injury, depending on the imaging pattern. This edema tracked to the approximate location of the quadrilateral space, where all three demonstrated considerable edema/inflammation (Figures 1-3) . Imaging features of the inflammatory vaccine reaction in the approximate location of the quadrilateral space and axilla and associated lymphatics/vessels could be misinterpreted as regional muscle strain, DVT, brachial plexus injury, neoplasm, or nonspecific infectious/inflammatory conditions depending on imaging features [18, 19] .",
