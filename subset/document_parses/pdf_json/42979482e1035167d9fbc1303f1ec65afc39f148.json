However, most of these apps target the first stages of learning a new language and are limited in the type of feedback that can be provided to users' spontaneous spoken responses. The English Language Artificial Intelligence (ELAi) app was developed to address this gap by providing users with a variety of prompts for spontaneous speech and adaptive, targeted feedback based on the automatic evaluation of spoken responses. Feedback in the ELAi app was presented across multiple pages such that users could choose the amount and depth of feedback that they wanted to receive. The present work evaluates how 94 English language learners interacted with the app. We focused on participants' use of the feedback pages and whether or not performance on spontaneous speech improved over the course of using the app. The findings revealed that users were most likely to access the most shallow feedback page, but use of the feedback pages differed based on the total number of sessions that users completed with the app. Users showed improvement in their response performance over the course of using the app, which suggests that the design of repeated practice and adaptive, targeted feedback in the ELAi app is promising.

MALL apps are typically able to provide targeted feedback on the quality of selectedresponse items, grammar and spelling for written responses, and word pronunciation for constrained speaking tasks. However, many MALL apps are limited in the level of detail that can be provided for feedback on speaking tasks [14, 15] . Duolingo, for example, identifies whether or not a user has correctly pronounced a word, but it does not provide feedback about how the user could more accurately pronounce the target word.

Spontaneous speaking tasks involve learners responding to an open-ended prompt (e.g., Tell me about your favorite vacation.). This type of task is utilized on many standardized assessments of language skills (e.g., TOEFL \u00ae , IELTS\u2122) as it shows an advanced level of speaking proficiency and spontaneous speaking skills are viewed as an important aspect of effective communication [19, 20] .

It is then important that we understand how users interact with the feedback provided.

Why?), and the feedback overview. After completing a new response, users were notified when feedback was available (latency was equivalent to the response length). User responses were evaluated with an automated speech analysis tool that used acoustic and language models to allow for the extraction of acoustic characteristics and creation of a response transcript. The models were based on nonnative English speakers to account for pronunciation differences due to accents. The automated speech analysis tool then evaluated the response on over 100 raw speech features from the acoustic characteristics and transcript. A subset of these features was selected based on their potential for learning feedback and were then combined to provide feedback on six key speech features (filler words, pauses, repeated words, speaking rate, stressed words, vocabulary diversity) to help users improve speaking skills. Users could access feedback on four pages within the app, which allowed for self-selection of the type and amount of feedback provided.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 77, "end": 85, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "ELAi App"}, {"text": "The first feedback page was My History (Fig. 1 , rightmost panel), which provided a Feedback Overview for each response at a relatively shallow level in that it only identified two speech features that needed improvement (weightlifter icon) and one feature that was done well (thumbs up icon). This was the first instance of feedback that was adaptive to the individual user. For example, in Fig. 1 the user needed to improve on Repeated Words and Vocabulary Diversity, whereas Filler Words was done well in the technology response (top card). Needs work was defined separately for each speech feature with some defined as overuse (filler words, pauses, repeated words, vocabulary diversity), whereas other features had an inverted U-shaped relationship in which too much or too little was problematic (speaking rate, stressed words). However, users were not provided with any explanations or resources to improve future responses on Overview. Thus, Overview provided minimal feedback on the quality of a response and minimal support for improving future responses but did serve as an organized resource for users to access all of the feedback they had received. Figure 2 shows the next feedback page that users could access by selecting a specific response card on Overview or directly through the feedback ready notification. This next page was Feedback Summary Report and was designed to be the main source of feedback for users. On Summary Report users could listen to their own response, review explanations for those three speech features that were shown on Overview, access additional ideas for how to develop a response to that prompt, and listen to sample responses from both native and nonnative English speakers (from left to right in Fig. 2 ). The design of Summary Report allowed the user to quickly develop an understanding of the quality of their response by focusing on two features that needed improvement and ensured that this feedback was actionable by providing users with additional information and resources to improve their future responses. Users could view more detailed feedback on Feedback Full Report and Feedback Details (see Fig. 3 ). The Full Report provided explanations for all six speech features. For example, in Fig. 3 the two leftmost panels show that the user did well on Filler Words but needed to improve on Repeated Words and Speaking Rate. Details provided even more detailed information about four of the six speech features (pauses, repeated words, filler words, vocabulary diversity). Details provided a transcript of the response (see second from the right panel in Fig. 3) , which highlighted the problematic aspects of the speech feature (e.g., repeated words). Details for vocabulary diversity provided suggestions of additional words that could be used to respond to the prompt (see rightmost panel in Fig. 3) . Full Report and Details provided users with a greater amount of and more indepth feedback, which can be beneficial if users dedicate the time and effort needed to process and apply the information provided [26] . Users were also able to view information about their app use metrics through the Me Screen. Users could see the total amount of time they had recorded responses, total number of responses, the amount of time for recorded responses in the current week, and how many days in a row they had recorded responses. The Me Screen also allowed users to View Badges that they earned. Users could earn a variety of badges that targeted engagement and performance. Engagement-based badges were designed to encourage persistence and regular practice (e.g., multi-day streaks of recording), whereas performancebased badges allowed users to track their progress over time on a single speech feature (e.g., received \"good job\" on filler words three times in a row).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3068, "end": 3072, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 39, "end": 46, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 392, "end": 398, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1163, "end": 1171, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1752, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2155, "end": 2161, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2248, "end": 2254, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2612, "end": 2619, "text": "Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2852, "end": 2859, "text": "Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "ELAi App"}, {"text": "Participants were 94 students from an English language learning program in China that primarily focused on preparation for standardized English language learning assessments.

The proportion of participants that accessed each feature at least once revealed a generally high rate of feature access, with the exception that 60% or less of users accessed the more in depth feedback pages (Full Report, Details) and listened to their own or samples responses, which were features that users specifically requested. This contradiction between what users say they want and how they interact with a MALL app has been found in other apps as well [28] . Overall the feature use analyses revealed that users spent the majority of their time interacting with the ELAi app browsing for a prompt, responding to prompts, viewing the shallowest level of feedback, and viewing their overall app usage data. This pattern is both consistent and inconsistent with user requests. Users were frequently practicing their spontaneous speech, but they were not typically utilizing the more detailed feedback and learning resources that they requested. It is important to note, however, that the more detailed feedback and learning resources were embedded in the app, meaning that users could only access them via another feedback page. Feedback Overview and Summary Report, on the other hand, could be accessed directly. Thus, the lack of access to the more detailed feedback (Full Report, Details) could represent a lack of user interest or lack of feature awareness. In an effort to consider this dependence between actions, we repeated the proportion of actions analysis with instances in which less detailed feedback page views were removed if they immediately preceded a more detailed feedback page view. This was an overly conservative analysis as it assumed that all of these less detailed feedback page views were only in service of accessing more detailed feedback.

This investigation reduced the number of users to 27 as users were required to have at least three sessions and to have at least one speech in both the first and last third of sessions. All 27 users included in this analysis were in the high engagement group, which means that they made greater use of the app features, in particular the more detailed feedback and resources for response improvement.

These findings are very promising as they show large improvements in a variety of speech features over a relatively short period of time. However, the findings should be interpreted with a modicum of caution as a small number of participants were included in these analyses (29% of sample), time on task varied across participants, and we were not able to consider additional resources that users may have accessed during this same time period (e.g., language courses, other MALL apps).
