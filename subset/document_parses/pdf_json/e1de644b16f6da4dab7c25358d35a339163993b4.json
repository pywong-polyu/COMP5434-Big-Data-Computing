This began as an outbreak in December 2019, and till February 28, 2020, there have been 83,704 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally, with 2,859 deaths, resulting in an overall case fatality rate of 3.41 per cent (95% confidence interval 3.29-3.54%). By this time (February 28, 2020) 58 countries or territories and one international conveyance (Diamond Princess Cruise Ship) were affected. As a part of the global response to manage and contain the pandemic, major emphasis was placed on generating research intelligence to guide evidence-based responses to contain the virus, which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), owing to its genetic similarities with the SARS virus. This review summarizes the emerging evidence which can help guide the public health response, particularly in India. Key areas have been identified in which research needs to be conducted to generate critical intelligence for advising prevention and control efforts. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has once again exposed the weaknesses of global health systems preparedness, ability to respond to an infectious threat, the rapidity of transmission of infections across international borders and the ineffectiveness of kneejerk policy responses to emerging/re-emerging infectious disease threats. The review concludes with the key learning points from the ongoing efforts to prevent and contain COVID-19 and identifies the need to invest in health systems, community-led response mechanisms and the need for preparedness and global health security.",

In the past two decades, this is the third instance of the emergence of a novel coronavirus, after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 1, 2 . The repeated emergence and global scale of transmission, significant number of deaths, infection and mortality of care providers and healthcare workers (HCWs), and higher risk of death in vulnerable or susceptible groups, have been the major causes of concern. Integrated early warning and response systems are an effective way to raise a timely alarm about these emerging and re-emerging pathogens, but few tools are available to enable pre-emptive prediction of such diseases. The Global Virome Project has been initiated with the objective of creating a global atlas of pathogenic viruses, with the specific objective of identifying spillover events 3, 4 . The project has not been without its critics, and is not yet close to providing evidence which can be translated into preparedness action 5 . This underscores the importance of preparedness of the health system to deal with dangerous pathogens and better control of endemic infections.",

Two recent estimates place it in the range of 2.0-3.1 and at 3.11 (95% CI 2.39-4.13) 33, 34 .

Mortality in Wuhan was even higher at 4.9% while it was 3.1 per cent in the Hubei province. A significant proportion of deaths in China (26%) occurred in elderly people, aged over 60 yr. However, at this juncture, when the epidemic is still evolving, temptations to make policy decisions based on mortality data should be reined in 36 .",

However, given the paucity of the evidence around this group of zoonotic viruses, it remains difficult to predict if the disease will eventually have a seasonal pattern. The four cases needed to set off the epidemic in China may not be representative, especially if the initial cases have been missed. The critical force of infection needed to establish a propagated epidemic is also unknown at this point, although it may be possible to model the effects based on assumptions. This also has direct bearing on the transmissibility of the disease, the specific estimate of which is yet to converge. In addition to the uncertainties around the agent and host factors associated with SARS-CoV-2, there are significant unknown factors about the environmental stability of the virus, and how effective fomites are in its transmission, especially in tropical countries. Bats have been implicated as reservoirs 45 , and given their wide flight range in Asia, specific host control is difficult and unrealistic.",

Particulate respirators (NIOSH-certified N95, EU standard FFP2 or equivalent) should be used by HCWs involved in aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). Face shields/goggles are to be used by all HCWs while performing AGPs. Long-sleeved, sterile, waterproof gowns, made of non-absorbable materials are to be worn. When gowns are not available, waterproof aprons should be used. Powder-free, latex gloves should be worn while handling infected patient's material. This should not be considered as a replacement of hand hygiene. Shoe covers should also be used in healthcare settings to prevent contamination of clothes. Respiratory and cough etiquettes should be adhered to: covering the nose and mouth while sneezing and coughing, using disposable tissue paper instead of cotton cloth, and if nothing else is available, using the flexed elbow, followed by appropriate hand hygiene.",
