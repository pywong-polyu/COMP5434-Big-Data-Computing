            "text": "Driven by the theory-building around the role of the non-verbal components to communication, we aimed to understand how therapists experience the therapeutic process using a facial mask. The empirical evidence of the power of non-verbal communication to engage therapists and clients in therapeutic work, develop a positive and collaborative relationship between them, and display empathy is quite large. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, drawing from the therapists' participation in an online survey. A sample of 137 psychotherapists with different therapy orientations and years of clinical practice participated in the study. Therapists conducted faceto-face therapy wearing face masks with existing and/or new clients. We performed an exploratory analysis, using descriptive statistics, to explore the psychotherapists' evaluations regarding perceived impact of face masks on different therapy quality dimensions. In a complementary rationale, we analyzed the therapists' perspectives on their experience wearing face masks using the thematic analysis methodology. Results show that among 137 psychotherapists, 114 were attending both existing and new clients, whereas only 13 were seeing exclusively existing clients and 10 were working exclusively with new clients. Despite no major differences were found between conditions regarding the perceived impact of face masks on different therapy quality dimensions and strategies adopted, the qualitative analysis allowed us to expand the quantitative results and deepen understanding of psychotherapists' experience. Based on general and typical patterns, we propose two distinct models to describe the therapist's experiences narrative when working with existing or new clients wearing face masks. Based on the results, we propose some recommendations to clinical practice in similar conditions.",

The mandatory use of face masks in public settings in many countries has brought sudden changes to daily life. Healthcare settings, including face-to-face mental health care, have been challenged. It seems that wearing face masks has a significant impact on verbal and non-verbal communication, affecting in turn the quality of the therapeutic relationship, in general, and their specific elements such as therapeutic alliance and therapeutic collaboration.",

Despite the main focus on the verbal content of the therapists and clients' interactions as an indicator of the therapeutic alliance quality, the non-verbal aspects of the psychotherapy process have gotten attention in the research field some time ago. In a research overview about the non-verbal behavior in therapist and client interactions, Hall et al. (1995) highlighted the role of the therapist's moderate head nodding and smiling, frequent eye contact, active facial responsiveness, and a warm and relaxed tone of voice to engage clients on the therapeutic work.",

            "text": "Regarding the clients' non-verbal behavior, the earliest studies were mainly focused on non-verbal cues to assess psychopathology and help therapists to define the therapeutic goals. More recent studies about the impact of non-verbal behaviors in psychotherapy state the influence of these behaviors on client's satisfaction with therapy, treatment adherence, and therapeutic outcomes. These studies (Roter et al., 2006; Foley and Gentile, 2010; Del Giacco et al., 2020) have shown that the quality of the therapeutic alliance is influenced by the therapist's and client's non-verbal modes and behaviors, which carry important information about the emotional experience of both elements of the dyad and the client's engagement and confidence. Thus, the information provided by non-verbal behaviors can be used to establish rapport between client and therapist and guide psychotherapy in a tolerable and therapeutic way toward mutual goals (Foley and Gentile, 2010) . In a recent study with depressed patients, Del Giacco et al. (2020) confirmed that the collaborative behaviors that lead to the construction of the therapeutic alliance are determined not only by the therapist's and client's verbal modes but also non-verbal modes, like an elaborative vocal mode employed by therapists and an emotional vocal mode by clients.",

            "text": "According to the Basic Emotion Theory (BET) core assumptions, emotions are the \"grammar of social living\" (Keltner et al., 2019, p.133) ; that is, the emotional expressions coordinate the interactions within meaningful relationships, as is the case of therapeutic relationships. Consistently with the BET assumptions, the last decades of research on the area indicate that emotional expression is a multimodal and dynamic pattern of behavior. These patterns involve different modalities such as facial action, vocalization, bodily movements, gaze, gestures, head movements, touch (e.g., De Gelder et al., 2006; App et al., 2011; Krumhuber et al., 2013; Keltner et al., 2019; Papapicco et al., 2021) . In reviewing the empirical literature on emotional expression and perception, Keltner et al. (2019) affirmed that some studies have contributed to differentiate expression of a broader range of emotions beyond the basic six emotions early studied, and upward of 20 emotions were found to have distinct multimodal expression. Relevant to our study is to note that almost all the 24 emotional states studied (e.g., sadness, anger, boredom, fear, and pain) were reliably communicated by multimodal patterns involving facial and vocal modalities. In addition, studies have shown that emotional expression provides valuable information to perceivers to guide their consequent behavior, evoke specific responses in social perceivers, signal the sender's trustworthiness, and influence the dynamic and structure of the interaction. For example, in a review of the effects of dynamic aspects of facial expressions, Krumhuber et al. (2013) found that people trust interlocutors and provide more information if they observe authentic smiles (which have more prolonged onset and offset times). The same author concluded that in addition to the multimodal nature, the dynamic information of emotional expression (direction, quality, and speed of motion) significantly impacts the emotion perception quality and accuracy.",

Carbon (2020) found that many emotional states such as happy, sad, and angry were misinterpreted as neutral, and emotions such as disgusted were confused with angry. According to Marler and Ditton (2020) , people infer emotions based on expression cues displayed by the mouth and, thus, covering the mouth may have a significant impact on non-verbal communication. The participants from a study carried out by Saunders et al. (2020) described that, besides making communication fatiguing, frustrating, and embarrassing, face masks wearing affect the communication content, interpersonal connection, and the disposition to engage in conversation. Since it compromises peoples' connectivity through facial expression, it may have negative psychological effects, leading to the dehumanization of social relationships (Vainshelboim, 2020) .",

First, we aimed to investigate the perceived impact of the face mask on the quality of the session, therapeutic alliance, communication, emotional and safety experiences, as evaluated by therapists in a questionnaire developed and based on the empirical literature. In accordance with literature findings, we expected that therapists evaluated negatively the impact of wearing face masks on the therapeutic relationship and communication. Furthermore, we expected that this negative evaluation was worse with reference to the therapy with new clients when compared with therapy with existing clients.

Namely, with respect to (a) the quality of the session, for both conditions (i.e., existing clients vs. new clients), the vast majority of therapists agree or strongly agree with the following statements: \"Item 1.

The client can express his/her emotional experience clearly\" (73 and 70%, respectively).

This possibility seems coherent with the identification of strategies related to the normalization of mask use. Moreover, we hypothesize that a more unfavorable assessment could create cognitive dissonance in therapists who must use the face-to-face intervention modality in the context of the pandemic.

            "text": "Despite the apparent absence of differences in evaluating the perceived impact of masks, therapists seem to have differentiated the preferred strategies used in each condition. The results show that therapists seem to value more strategies for normalizing or accommodating the mask when working with existing clients while seeming to value strategies focused on communication and therapeutic skills more when working with new clients. Interestingly, these results suggest different therapists' experiences in both conditions, although we did not observe them as reflected in the perceived impact assessment. In our opinion, it is understandable and even expected that therapists did more attention to communication skills when working with new clients, whose knowledge of facial and emotional expression is more limited. On the other hand, normalization of masks in therapy with existing clients seems to function to accommodate the new circumstance of therapy and respond to other types of needs, such as ensuring confidence in the therapeutic process and its continuity in another format. Indeed, the importance of therapeutic communication quality to achieve and maintain a good quality of therapeutic alliance and the confident dyad engagement is welldocumented in previous studies (e.g., Foley and Gentile, 2010; Del Giacco et al., 2020) . Second, the qualitative analysis expands the quantitative results describing the therapists' experience based on their voices, offering a more detailed and deeper understanding of it. Almost all therapists, whether they refer to their work with existing clients or with new clients, expressed a demanding experience and reported valuable resources to manage the difficulties identified. We would emphasize the typical reference to therapist communication difficulties in both conditions and the discomfort reported typically by therapists working with new clients as contributing to the demanding experience. These results are in line with findings in the literature (e.g., Saunders et al., 2020; Vainshelboim, 2020) and appear to be consistent with the resources reported by the therapists. Note that the therapists reported different strategies in both conditions. However, despite other strategies, those focused on communication and normalization were similarly reported as helpful in both conditions. In addition, it seems that wearing a face mask when working with new clients allows therapists to pay attention to the therapeutic relationship (e.g., difficulties in therapeutic relationship; taking care of the therapeutic relationship). Thus, the therapists' perspectives add further evidence to the relevance of non-verbal behaviors and facial and emotional expression to the development of therapeutic bond or the empathic negotiation of goals and tasks and expand the previous findings of communication clarity and therapeutic relationship quality (e.g., Foley and Gentile, 2010; Del Giacco et al., 2020) .",

Second, while working with new clients, therapists expressed the physical presence as a condition to enable therapy. In our view, the distinction between models regarding the therapists' experience suggests that the previous familiarity and knowledge about the clients favor progressive adaptation and the perception of harmlessness experience.
