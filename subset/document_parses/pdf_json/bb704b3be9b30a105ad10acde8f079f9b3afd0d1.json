Automatic therapeutic substitution (ATS) protocols are formulary tools that allow for provider-selected interchange from a nonformulary preadmission medication to a formulary equivalent. Previous studies have demonstrated that the application of clinical decision support (CDS) tools to ATS can decrease ATS errors at admission, but there are limited data describing the impact of CDS on discharge errors.

These studies have demonstrated that implementation of CDS technology can result in an absolute decrease in ATS-related admission errors of 12.6% to 14.4%. 4, 10 While there are data to support the utility of CDS in guiding TI at patient admission, the impact of CDS on discharge errors following application of an ATS protocol has not been fully addressed. Further, there is concern that discharge errors pursuant to a TI may lead to consequences in the outpatient setting where monitoring and provider follow-up are less frequent. Lending credence to these concerns, a 2020 study evaluating the relationship between TI protocols and discharge medication changes found that TI increased the incidence of discharge medication errors by 70% when compared to medications that were not converted during admission. 6 A study by Kang et al 10 is one of the only published studies evaluating CDS impact on discharge medication reconciliation. Before CDS implementation, the authors reported that 65% of all TI-eligible discharge medications were associated with at least 1 discrepancy, with the most common error being continuation of an interchange medication (60% of errors) upon discharge. Following CDS implementation, however, the frequency of inappropriate discharge orders decreased to 16%; again, continuation of formulary interchange medication upon discharge was the most common error. This study was the first to support CDS use in discharge prescribing after TI, but the results lacked generalizability owing to the study design. Additionally, discharge medication accuracy was a secondary endpoint, and A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 6 the study was not powered to detect a significant difference in pre-and postimplementation outcomes. Further, the investigators looked at only 3 medication classes, which is not representative of the multitude of potential therapeutic conversions that are allowable in most ATS protocols.",

Results from this study showed that CDS implementation decreased the absolute incidence of discharge medication errors from 64.5% to 16.3% of all TI encounters (P < 0.05). In contrast to these data, we were unable to realize a significant difference between the groups before and after CDS implementation at our hospital site. In comparing results from the previous publication with our own findings, it is important to note that, in the reference study by Kang et al, 10 ATS protocols were a new initiative at the study site. The increased awareness around ATS protocols during the study period likely contributed to the significant decrease in errors.

Furthermore, the observed 1.4% decrease in discharge medication discrepancies in our study was much smaller than the expected delta we used to calculate sample size.

            "text": "Discharge errors in our study were driven largely by inappropriate reconciliation (ie, continuation of a formulary medication at discharge); these errors accounted for more than 50% of errors in both the pre-and postimplementation periods. Findings from this study were similar to those of previous publications, which also report inappropriate discharge reconciliation as a top reason for discharge medication errors. One study by Glaholt et al 7 found that, of 47 patients discharged on inappropriate therapy, 32% were inappropriately discharged on a formulary agent rather than their home medication. A similar study found that 8% of patients discharged from an academic medical center were inappropriately prescribed a formulary agent at discharge following ATS interchange and that this was the most common discrepancy type only behind omissions (10% of patients). 6 There is no clear explanation for why this type of error is so common, but it may be a function of familiarity; inpatient providers, anecdotally, are more comfortable dosing and prescribing medications that they see on a daily basis and may gravitate A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 13 toward formulary agents when planning discharge. In contrast to inappropriate reconciliation, therapeutic duplication was the least common type of error in our study (3.8% vs 3.0% in the pre-and postimplementation periods). This is likely because, at our institution, medications within the same AHFS class are \"grouped\" together during discharge reconciliation. This function of the EHR allows providers to quickly identify duplications. Further, pharmacists at our institution are intimately involved in the discharge reconciliation process and are often able to identify errors before the provider can sign discharge orders. These potential explanations are specific to our institution; other entities may experience alternative reasons for discharge prescribing changes",

National accreditation bodies such as the Joint Commission consistently identify accurate medication reconciliation as a performance measure for patient safety. 13 With this in mind, it is worrisome that TI-related discharge error rates at our institution are as high as 10% to 13% even with CDS guidance. This knowledge is one of the reasons critics of ATS protocols argue that TI is not only an irresponsible practice but also may actually contribute to patient harm. 12, 14, 15 Despite such concerns, available data suggest that TI-related discharge errors, while undesirable, are not significantly associated with detrimental outcomes. In one study, Popp et al 6 evaluated the relationship between TI, discharge medication changes, and the impact of these changes on hospital readmissions. The authors evaluated 16 therapeutic classes and tracked associated readmissions, including visits to the emergency department (ED), for 497 patient encounters. Through their analysis, the researchers concluded that neither TI nor the number of discharge medication changes was a predictor of readmission or ED visits at 30, 60, or 90 days, indicating that discrepancies following TI are not correlated with A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 14 rehospitalization. Ultimately, the evidence suggests that this practice is not only safe but beneficial in terms of hospital administration and patient care. 2, 12 Risks from ATS-related interchanges must be appropriately weighed against benefits. In this study, CDS implementation significantly improved admission formulary adherence to ATS protocols, a finding consistent with previous publications demonstrating increased formulary and ATS protocol compliance following the implementation of CDS technology. 3, 4, 10 This discovery further supports the use of CDS technology as a valuable tool in patient care delivery. EHR changes such as ATS alerts are relatively simple for informatics personnel to implement, and these efforts can translate into significant patient benefit. In fact, research shows that implementation of, and adherence to, CDS tools can significantly improve clinical outcomes and decrease costs associated with hospitalization. 16 As this relates to our study, implementation of CDSguided TI may allow practitioners to spend less time reviewing medication lists and more time on essential clinical services. This study did not evaluate either inpatient or outpatient clinical outcomes, but it is reasonable to presume that implementation had a positive impact on patient care and clinical workflow based on data from similar studies touting the impact of CDS technology. 3, 4, 6, 16 This study had a number of limitations beyond the inherent confines of a retrospective study. First, owing to a large number of patients and the variability in documentation between providers, we did not review progress notes or documentation other than pharmacist interventions to identify whether discharge errors, as defined by our protocol, were intentional changes rather than discrepancies. Inpatient providers frequently change or discontinue a home medication during the course of an inpatient stay based on patient presentation and hospital course. Because of inconsistent A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 15 documentation, our data were unable to identify such instances and our results may therefore overestimate the discharge error rate. The way in which we documented inappropriate reconciliation vs duplication may also have inflated the error rate.",

However, this limitation was systematic and applied to interchanges in the preand post-CDS periods; while numbers may be exaggerated, trends in error and error types are expected to be consistent with the presented data. Another limitation was that we assessed errors associated with specific ATS interchange; we did not assess errors at the encounter level. In other words, if a patient encounter was selected based on an ACE inhibitor interchange, the encounter was assessed only for errors related to the ACE inhibitor class and not for errors on the discharge medication list as a whole. Using this approach, we are unable to estimate the number of inpatient encounters that may include 1 or more ATS-related errors; further, we are unable to report, on average, how many errors were associated with an individual patient encounter. Only 9 medication classes were included in this study, some of which corresponded to very few encounters over the studied time period. The small sample size limited our ability to determine whether CDS support is more important for certain classes of medications. Additionally, because of the way data were collected, we were unable to quantify how many interchanges were accompanied by a provider-facing alert. For example, if a provider manually ordered an interchange medication after CDS implementation, that manual change would still count as a post-CDS encounter. Finally, we did not collect data on patient-specific characteristics such as age, sex, or medication list complexity; as such, we cannot draw any conclusions regarding whether a specific population is more or less A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 16 vulnerable to discharge medication errors.",
