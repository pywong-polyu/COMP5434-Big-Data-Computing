Another hypothesis is related to the mechanisms of disease of HCoV. Both SARS coronavirus and HCoV-NL63 use the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the main pathway for attachment and entry. Following infection, a substantial reduction of the ACE2 expression in the cell surfaces occurs [14] , but the rate and the intensity of this downregulation seems to be much lower in HCoV-NL63 infections as compared to SARS coronavirus infections. ACE2 downregulation was previously shown to be associated with an increase of the inflammatory process in the respiratory tract and may be one of the determinants of severity in acute respiratory distress syndrome [14] .
