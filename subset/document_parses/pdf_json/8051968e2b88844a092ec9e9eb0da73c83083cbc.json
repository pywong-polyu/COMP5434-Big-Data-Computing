The COVID-19 rapidly spread all over the world and has become a public health concern due to its high level of contagion and mortality (Guan et al., 2020) . Previously identified vulnerability factors for psychological problems in breakouts include negative affect, anxiety, intolerance to uncertainty, and perceived vulnerability to diseases (Taylor, 2019) . Specific fears peculiar to COVID-19 stemming from the uncertainty and novelty of the situation appears to be central in the excessive psychological reactions. . Negative experiences were also reported to be associated with various factors such as shattered safety assumptions about the world, cyberchondria and health anxiety (Scalabrini et al., 2020) .",

Addressing different aspects of risk perception in COVID-19, Ding et al. (2020) found that cognitive and affective risk perception in public health crisis were significantly associated with depression, whereas distance perception and positive perception about prevention and control policies were inversely tied to depressive symptoms. In a related investigation, risk perception was found to be varying as a function of gender, age, marital status as well as self-efficacy and imagination .",

Despite several advantages of online health-related searches, because of excessive and unreliable information, those individuals screening on Internet are at risk for eliciting more intense and uncontrollable patterns of maladaptive health-related behaviors called as cyberchondria (Doherty-Torstrick et al., 2016) . Cyberchondria serves as a psychological coping mechanism to reduce health-related anxious arousal and assure a sense of safety in the face of health issue; however, Internet searches result in greater anxiety and more intense safety-seeking behaviors in the long term (Fergus, 2014; Norr et al., 2015) . Anxiety sensitivity and intolerance of uncertainty are regarded as risk factors for cyberchondria. In an experimental study, it was identified that anxiety sensitivity was the hallmark of individuals with cyberchondriac characteristics (Norr et al., 2014) . Fergus (2013) identified in a community sample that intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety sensitivity, and health anxiety were tied to cyberchondria, in which these predictors accounted for approximately half of the unique variance of maladaptive health-related online searches.",

The coronavirus outbreak was also related to negative affect and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. In keeping with the previous findings, Tzur Bitan et al.

In China, prevalence rates of probable obsessive-compulsive disorders in the early stage of the coronavirus pandemic was found to be higher than either middle stage or late stage (Ji et al., 2020) .

However, most of the previous studies addressed relationships in part between these potential predictors of pandemic-induced fears. Nevertheless, the associations between an entire set of these variables of interest has still elusive. To this end, the present study was set out to investigate the complex associations between those variables of interest using a mixture structural equation modeling approach. It was speculated that perceived vulnerability to diseases and negative affect would serve as predictor variables in the structural model, in which these variables were associated with sleep quality, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and health anxiety. Those relationships between variables of interest were hypothesized to be mediated by cyberchondria and COVID-19 fears. We also hypothesized that, given the complex relationships between these variables of interest, participants would reveal various patterns of psychological characteristics that would be critical in understanding individual differences in their psychological responses in the face of COVID-19 pandemic. Put succinctly, our main objective in general is to identify the heterogeneity of psychological response patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic that would promote the effectiveness of preventive and curative interventions, particularly related to health anxiety.",

Mixture structural equation modeling is a two-step approach (Collins & Lanza, 2010) . Firstly, the specified multivariate relationships between variables of interest would be tested using structural equation modelling approach. To avoid from biased estimation, corrected maximum likelihood estimates with standard errors and a chi-square test statistic that are robust to non-normality and non-independence of observations were computed in the structural equation modeling (Satorra & Bentler, 1994 ). Normality corrected model fit indices were utilized to test the Pandemic Health Anxiety Model (Bentler, 1990; Bentler & Bonett, 1980; Hooper et al., 2008; Hu & Bentler, 1999; Steiger, 1990) . According to the guidelines, acceptable range for the model fit indices are as follows (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Kline, 2015) : The direct and indirect associations between variables of interest, including cyberchondria, fear of COVID-19 infection, health anxiety, perceived vulnerability to diseases, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, negative affect, and sleep quality in the PHAM were specified based on the theoretical explanations and findings of the existing literature. Then, direct and indirect associations among the variables of interest in the specified PHAM were assessed. In the second step of the mixture structural equation modeling, robust maximum likelihood estimates for the associations between variables of interest in the specified PHAM were subjected to mixture modeling latent profile analysis (Collins & Lanza, 2010) . In the mixture modeling approach Yuan-Bentler sandwich estimator was utilized (Yuan & Bentler, 2000) . To identify the homogeneous subgroups in the sample, optimal number of latent classes were identified based on the maximum likelihood estimates in the PHAM of national survey data. Three information criteria is critical in model comparison of latent class analysis: Akaike Information Criterion [AIC] (Akaike, 1987) , Bayesian Information Criterion [BIC] (Schwarz, 1978) and Adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion [ABIC] (Burnham & Anderson, 2004) . The lower the information criterion value for the respective latent class model, the better the mixture model fit data (Burnham & Anderson, 2004; Nylund et al., 2007; Preacher & Hayes, 2008) . In addition to the information criteria, we used Vuong-Lo-Mendel-Rubin likelihood test and Lo-Mendel-Rubin likelihood test to compare k-class model to k-1-class nested model. Drawn from the parsimonious principle, unsubstantial statistical significance between baseline and nested models (p > 0.05) shows that k-1-class model fit the data compared to k-latent-class model (Lo et al., 2001) .",

The entropy index is an indicator of quality of class membership classification (Celeux & Soromenho, 1996) . The entropy index is the summary of posterior probabilities of participants allocated in class k, ranging from 0 to 1. Mplus uses the relative entropy criterion (Dias & Vermunt, 2006; Wedel & Kamakura, 2000) for the k-class mixture model that rescales the entropy index according to the sample size, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998 -2017 ). An entropy index value greater than 0.80 is suggested to be highly acceptable for homogeneity of latent classes (Clark, 2010) , and a value of 0.60 or less is considered as low (Asparouhov & Muthen, 2014; .",

Cyberchondria severity also mediated the relationships of negative affectivity with obsessive-compulsive symptoms (indirect \u03b2 = 0.015, 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals = 0.012-0.019, t = 8.065, p < 0.001) and poor sleep quality (indirect \u03b2 = 0.075, 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals = 0.068-0.083, t = 19.582, p < 0.001). Negative affectivity statistically significantly contributed to the health anxiety (indirect \u03b2 = 0.164, 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals = 0.154-0.173, t = 34.540, p < 0.001) through COVID-19 fears as well. Results of mediation analyses are presented in Table 3 .",

Beginning from 1-latent-class to 7-latent-class, parameters of the previously converged structural equation model were subjected to mixture analysis to obtain optimal number of latent classes. We computed the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), Adjusted Bayesian Information Criteria (ABIC), Vuong-Lo-Mendell-Rubin Likelihood Ratio Test (VLMR), and Lo-Mendell-Rubin Adjusted Likelihood Ratio Test (LMRT) to determine optimal number of latent classes. The VLML (689.828, p = 0.0831) and LMRT (677.315, p = 0.0863) showed that 6-latentclass was the optimal model compared to the 7-latentclass model. 6-latent-class model had lower values for information criteria than other models with latent classes less than six (AIC = 247,164.096, BIC = 247,522.172, and ABIC = 247,360.104). The entropy index for the model was 0.901 which showed a high consistency within latent class (> 0.80). In addition, average classification membership probability for each of the latent class was greater than 0.70. The average classification membership probabilities for the latent homogenous subgroups were 0.913, 0.908, 0.928, 0.849, 0.933, and 0.986, respectively. Given the mixture analysis results, we concluded that 6-latent-class model was the optimal model revealing best fit to the current data. Results are presented in Table 4 .",

The associations between fear of COVID-19, cyberchondria, health anxiety, affective symptoms, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and sleep quality were examined using mixture structural equation modeling approach. The structural analysis of the PHAM showed that perceived vulnerability to diseases and negative affect including depression and anxiety significantly contributed to health anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and poor sleep quality. These relationships were mediated by cyberchondria and fear of COVID-19 in the structural model. As mentioned above, in keeping with the literature, we supported and expanded the previous findings with respect to the scientific research on psychological functioning during COVID-19 pandemic. However, in the literature, relationships between the variables of interest addressed in the current data have not been investigated in such an extensive way. This study would be a preliminary one addressing the relationships between all these seven psychological variables using an advanced statistical approach of mixture structural equation modeling. Finally, the mixture model indicated the heterogeneity of associations between variables of interest. Six latent classes were extracted in the mixture analysis: 1) Risk-Aversive Healthy Group (n = 1212, 14.64%); 2) Incautious Healthy Group (n = 2869, 34.67%); 3) Infection Obsessions Group (n = 2939, 35.51%); 4) Health Anxiety Group (n = 151, 1.82%); 5) Negative Affect Group (n = 166, 2.01%); and 6) General Psychopathology Group (n = 939, 11.35%). In addition to the findings regarding PHAM and latent classes, we identified that 46.38% of the Turkish sample reported poor sleep quality, 43.92% of the participants reported clinical levels of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, 10.8% had severe depressive symptoms and 13.34% had pathological levels of anxiety symptomatology in the national survey data. A series of studies examined the prevalence of psychiatric disorders occurred in different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the awake of the breakout, in a community sample of 1210 individuals from 194 different cities in China, 53.8% of the participants were reported to be psychologically influenced by the pandemic, ranging from moderate to severe. Additionally, 28.8% of the participants revealed moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Most serious fears were concerned with their family members that might be infected with the COVID-19 (75.2%) . Another research conducted immediately after the onset of the pandemic in a community population of 1060 individuals found that more than 70% of the participants showed serious psychological symptoms. The most common mental health problems were identified as obsessive-compulsive symptoms, phobic anxiety and psychotic symptoms, and high educated divorced or widowed elder people who were over the age of 50 were at greater risk for developing mental health problems (Tian et al., 2020) . In another national survey in China among 55,657 participants reported that 53.8% of the sample experienced clinical depression, 46.7% experienced clinical anxiety, and 29.7% experienced clinical insomnia (Wang et al., 2021) . Similarly, the prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and comorbid anxietydepression comorbidity were reported as much as 51.6%, 47.5%, and 24.5%, respectively . In consistent with the previous findings, our findings indicated that obsessive-compulsive symptoms, sleep disturbances and mood-realted probelems were prominent among community samples.",

            "text": "The structural model of the current data showed that perceived vulnerability to diseases was directly associated with health anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and sleep problems. Moreover, perceived vulnerability to diseases was indirectly linked to obsessive-compulsive symptoms and sleep problems through cyberchondria. Perceived vulnerability to diseases, which refers to one's attributions about the risk of contracting a disease, is considered to be as an integral part of the behavioral immune system. The concept of behavioral immune system includes recognizing the factors that might cause infection in the environment, activating cognitive and emotional processes in case of possible risk, and behaviors to avoid possible risk situations (Schaller & Park, 2011) . The ability of the individual to properly evaluate the probability of exposure to potential infectious pathogens by optimal use of internal and external stimuli and to stay away from risky situations is an issue closely related to the optimal or sufficiently flexible use of the behavioral immune system. If this system is on fully alert, in other words, if it perceives the possibilities that will not cause trouble as risky, this situation may overshadow the benefits gained by the person (Schaller, 2015) . On the other hand, individuals' negative evaluations related to their health status increase their fear of COVID-19 and lead individuals to be more careful about taking the necessary precautions against the risk of infection (Ahorsu et al., 2020) . The results of a survey with a normal population sample of 7554 individuals in Brazil showed that individuals high in self-confidence and able to evaluate their vulnerability levels against diseases in a realistic way easily adapt to measures of outbreak; however, individuals who trusted the health system were more likely to reveal risky behaviors (Storopoli et al., 2020) . In a similar vein, the literature consistently showed that perceived vulnerability to diseases and evaluations regarding the reliability of outbreak precautions significantly predicted compliance with outbreak rules and regulations (Clark et al., 2020; Makhanova & Shepherd, 2020; Prasetyo et al., 2020) . In a study conducted with a group of participants with psychiatric disorders in Taiwan, it was found that information related to infection, especially from the media, caused an increase in fear of COVID-19, which, in turn, increased depression, anxiety, and stress levels, then it reduced the personal sensitivity to measures to prevent infection (Chang et al., 2020) . Especially during the outbreak, individuals who exposed to intensive information about infections and health issues were more likely to engage unduly search for the ways of staying healthy on the Internet (Zheng et al., 2020) . In a study conducted in a general population sample of 1000 people over 50-year-olds in Iran, it was found that the negative cognitive evaluations of participants with respect to their physical health conditions increased their fear of COVID-19 that led to sleep problems which was significantly associated with other types of psychological problems (Ahorsu et al., 2020) . Similarly, perceived vulnerability to diseases was significantly associated with COVID-19-related worries, social isolation, and traumatic stress (Boyraz et al., 2020) .",

The present data supported these premises that perceived vulnerability to diseases significantly contributed to cyberchondria severity with a large effect size that indirectly led to increase in obsessive compulsive symptoms and poor sleep quality. Perceived vulnerability to diseases also was directly associated with health anxiety as well as obsessive-compulsive symptoms and poor sleep quality. More importantly, in the PHAM, cyberchondria revealed a robust association with poor sleep quality and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.",

Indirect relationships of negative affect with obsessive compulsive symptoms and poor sleep quality were also mediated by cyberchondria. Negative affect seemed to be the strongest predictor of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in the PHAM. Besides, negative emotions directly predicted the deterioration in sleep quality. Fear of COVID-19 was the strong predictor of health anxiety. Moreover, indirect relationship between negative affect and health anxiety was mediated by fear of COVID-19. Our results were consistent with the preceding research studies addressing the pivotal role of affective problems in mental functioning. The results of a survey that was conducted in Bangladesh with 10.067 people showed that 33% of the participants experienced depression associated with COVID-19 and 5% developed suicidal thoughts due to outbreak (Mamun et al., 2021) . In a study conducted with a large sample of American adults, it was found that after controlling for age, gender, educational level and ethnic group variables, and being caught with coronavirus, common anxiety symptoms, depression, loss of function, lack of social support and suicidal thoughts significantly increased COVID-19 anxiety (Lee et al., 2020) . Another study, which was conducted in Turkey with individuals who were diagnosed with bipolar disorder and were in remission at the time of the study, revealed that the individuals' sleep quality substantially suffered during COVID-19 outbreak (Ayd\u0131no\u011flu & Yazla, 2021) . In accordance with these findings, reported that individuals with anxiety-related disorders had higher levels of stress and fear associated with COVID-19 than individuals without any mental health problems.",

The six-latent-class was extracted as the optimal model in the analysis as follows: 1) Risk-Aversive Healthy Latent Class (n = 1212, 14.64%), 2) Incautious Healthy Latent Class (n = 2869, 34.67%), 3) Infection Obsessions Latent Class (n = 2939, 35.51%), 4) Health Anxiety Latent Class (n = 151, 1.82%), 5) Negative Affect Latent Class (n = 166, 2.01%), and 6) General Psychopathology Latent Class (n = 939, 11.35%). Both Risk-Aversive Healthy Latent Class and Incautious Healthy Latent Class was characterized by low levels of psychopathology. In sharp contrast to Incautious Healthy Latent Class, participants classified into Risk-Aversive Healthy Latent Class reported relatively greater scores on perceived vulnerability to diseases. Individuals allocated in the Infection Obsessions Latent Class were more likely to report severe levels of cyberchondria, fear of COVID-19, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, negative-affect, poor sleep quality. On the other hand, fear of COVID-19, health anxiety and perceived vulnerability to diseases were the hallmark of Health Anxiety Latent Class. Latent class membership probabilities of both Negative Affect Latent Class and General Psychopathology Latent Class were significantly connected to all psychological variables addressed in the study, whereas only obsessionality was not associated with Negative Affect Latent Class. More importantly, individuals in the Negative Affect Latent Class reported less severe levels of psychological problems than the General Psychopathology Latent Class. Most remarkably, participants in Negative Affect Latent Class differentiated from all other subgroups with greater chronic illnesses among their first-degree relatives, being younger and being more educated. It seems that individual differences of participants in the Negative Affect Latent Class from other latent classes represent a cohort effect which should be warranted in further studies. In line with our findings, identified that female adolescents who were living in red flagged zones in Italy were susceptible to experience severe psychological distress. Drastic changes in lifestyle due to lockdowns in terms of decreased levels of physical activity and reduced life-quality habits affected adults (Bivia-Roig et al., 2020) , however, school closure probability multiplied the negative effects of COVID-19 among youngsters (Esposito et al., 2021) .",

Taylor et al. (2020a) argued that studies on COVID-19 generally reflect the fear of infection on a one-dimensional basis, whereas the stress caused by the pandemic should be addressed in five dimensions in the context of a syndrome approach: 1) Danger and contamination fears, 2) fears about economic consequences, 3) xenophobia, 4) compulsive checking and reassurance seeking, and 5) traumatic stress symptoms about COVID-19. The COVID-19 Stress Scales (Taylor et al., 2020b) , which measure these five dimensions, were used to collect data from 6854 participants aged 18-94. The data subjected to latent profile analysis which classified the community sample in five latent profiles from the perspective of COVID-19 stress syndrome. It was observed that individuals grouped in the 1st and 2nd latent classes experienced a very low level of stress related to the pandemic process, and that 16% of the participants grouped into the 5th latent class experienced COVID-19 stress syndrome at the highest level. When the network analysis was performed among the five sub-dimensions measured, the danger of infection and the fear of getting sick were found to be at the center of all dimensions (Taylor et al., 2020a) .",

Moreover, interventions focusing more on emotion regulation skills, anxiety management skills and increasing sleep hygiene may be more appropriate for the Infection Obsessions Group and Health Anxiety Group. On the other hand, individuals in General Psychopathology and Negative Affect groups scored extremely high in terms of the variables considered in both groups.
