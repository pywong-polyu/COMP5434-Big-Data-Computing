We developed a strategy for overcoming this bias to obtain more plausible estimates of the true values of key epidemiological variables. We fit mechanistic Bayesian latent-variable SIR models to confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries, for all regions (countries and US states) independently. Bayesian averaging over models, we find that the raw infection incidence rate underestimates the true rate by a factor, the case ascertainment ratio CAR t that depends upon region and time. At the regional onset of COVID-19, the predicted global median was 13 infections unreported for each case confirmed (CAR t = 0.07 C.I. (0.02, 0.4)). As the infection spread, the median CAR t rose to 9 unreported cases for every one diagnosed as of April 15, 2020 (CAR t = 0.1 C.I. (0.02, 0.5)). We also estimate that the median global initial reproduction number R 0 is 3.3 (C.I (1.5, 8.3)) and the total infection fatality rate near the onset is 0.17% (C.I. (0.05%, 0.9%)). However the time-dependent reproduction number R t and infection fatality rate as of April 15 were 1.2 (C.I. (0.6, 2.5)) and 0.8% (C.I. (0.2%,4%)), respectively.

A similar model assumed complete quarantine on the basis of debilitating effects of illness or strict adherence to policy (Pedersen and Meneghini) , which we relax to quantify the effectiveness of such actions.

Confirmed cases C can then either recover ( R C ) or die ( D C ) and also infect more S at a rate that can differ from I . Mitigation efforts (including any social or policy changes aimed at reducing transmission rates) are modeled by a time dependence on the rate of infectious transmission. This rate changes from an initial value to a final value on a specified day with a 5 day transition period. We also include a similar time dependence in the rate of transition from I to C to account for changes in testing regimens, clinical classification, and awareness of infected individuals to seek medical attention. We consider six variations of the latent-variable SIR model of varying complexity.

We modeled prior probabilities for recovery and death rates using inverse gamma distributions derived from ref. (Verity et al.) .
