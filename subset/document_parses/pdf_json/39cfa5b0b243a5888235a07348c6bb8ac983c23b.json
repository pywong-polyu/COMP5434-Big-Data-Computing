[10] [11] [12] Even when diagnosed, most rare diseases lack effective treatments, leaving many RUD patients reliant on clinical research as their primary source of therapy or for achieving a long-sought diagnosis. 13 However, many clinical research studies were halted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 14-17 RUD patients, and particularly pediatric patients, also often rely on diverse educational and therapeutic services, including those delivered through schools, which are essential but not easily translated to remote platforms. Prolonged stay-at-home orders therefore have the potential to dramatically impact the health of this population. At the same time, these patients are, by definition, grappling with complex health conditions that may create additional vulnerabilities to COVID-19 infection. This tension between increased needs and increased risks raises complex ethical and policy questions regarding how best to ensure that essential services are accessible and sufficient to meet the needs of this vulnerable population.",

Targeted keywords (e.g., \"Aarskog syndrome\") were drawn from the National Organization of Rare Diseases (NORD) rare diseases database. 18 We confirmed that groups were focused on RUDs by cross-checking the group description with rare disease databases published by professional organizations, including NORD, 19 Global Genes, 20 Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center, 21 and Orphanet. 22 Any disease identified as rare on any of these lists was considered a rare disease for the purpose of this study. We excluded any groups explicitly oriented to participants in countries other than the United States based on the group description. Once identified, a member of the study team contacted the group administrators through private Facebook message. Of 290 group administrators contacted, 76 responded and posted the Qualtrics survey link together with the study description. A full list of participating groups is provided in Appendix A.",

Our results suggest that the pandemic is exacerbating longstanding challenges already faced by RUD patients (e.g., further extending an already long diagnostic odyssey) and also introducing new elements to these existing challenges (e.g., new limits on caregiver support impacting advocacy needs). While some aspects of these challenges may be shared by other patient populations grappling with complex health conditions, others may be specific to RUD patients. For example, while there is understandable enthusiasm for expansion of telehealth as a way of increasing health-care access for patients during the pandemic, 30 our results suggest that telehealth may have significant limitations for very complex patients requiring coordination across multiple specialties, such as those with RUDs. In addition, while the impacts of COVID-19 visitation policies and their consequences have been examined in the context of intensive care unit (ICU) care of COVID-19 patients, 31,32 RUD patients' complex health challenges require increased advocacy even when accessing routine care. On the other hand, the limited literature in other patient groups indicates that those grappling with complex health conditions, such as cancer, 33 during the pandemic also are at risk for serious mental health challenges, such as those described by our respondents. Our qualitative data further suggest that the anxiety caused by the pandemic may be leading some RUD patients to forgo treatment altogether, with potentially catastrophic implications for their already complex health. Similarly, while closure of schools has impacted countless families in myriad ways, 34 for children with special needsincluding many RUD patients-these closures have resulted in the reduction of critical therapeutic services, many of which do not easily translate to remote platforms.

For example, clinical settings could develop methods for identifying RUD patients within health-care systems and creating policy exceptions for those with increased advocacy needs. They could support coordinated telehealth planning across specialties to ensure that RUD patients can reap the benefits of expanded telehealth while ensuring that their complex health conditions are sufficiently monitored, and that they know when they need in-person care. This includes a need to explicitly reassure RUD patients that in-person care can be delivered safely and, in the case of COVID-19 treatment, with careful consideration of a patient's RUD. Further, any efforts toward a multidisciplinary \"one stop\" model of highly coordinated care that can individually tailor care and integrate medical and social support needs is likely to improve outcomes for RUD patients both during and well beyond the pandemic. 7,36, 37 Research institutions should consider research focused on diagnosis of undiagnosed patients when crafting their research guidelines in the midst of the ongoing pandemic. For example, the current Stanford School of Medicine guidelines explicitly identify, \"research that obtains critical, in-person observations or laboratory measures on vulnerable patients or populations where not obtaining these observations could negatively impact patient outcomes, safety or care,\" as the highest priority for restarting, together with treatment studies. 38 Johns Hopkins University's research reopening plan similarly emphasizes that studies with the potential for direct clinical benefit to patients should be prioritized. 39 While the language in these policies suggests that studies focused on RUD diagnoses would likely be included, further research is needed to understand how various institutions are approaching this issue.",

In addition, as nearly half of all patients in our sample identified as having a disability, the RUD community may benefit from COVID-19 resources designed for the disability community, such as those provided by the American Association on Health and Disability. 41 Our study has a number of limitations. As is common in online survey research using similar methods, 24 our response rate cannot be empirically determined but is likely low given our broad dissemination strategy. However, our approach did allow us to include patients from a large number of RUD groups, at least partially addressing a longstanding challenge in understanding the shared experiences of the RUD community. 35 It is possible that certain segments of the RUD community are overrepresented in our sample due to a variety of factors, including receptiveness of individual Facebook group administrators to participation. Further research in a representative sample of RUD patients would be needed to confirm generalizability and to examine the frequency and variability of these themes within the RUD community. In addition, women are overrepresented in our study, race/ethnic minority patients are underrepresented, and non-English-speaking patients are not included. Given the known disparities in COVID-19 impacts particularly for racial/ethnic minority groups, 42 their perspectives are key and require attention.

In addition, although we focused on groups oriented to patients in the United States, we cannot be certain that all respondents were US residents.

As the pandemic continues, creativity and flexibility will be critical to ensuring that RUD patients receive the care they need to manage their complex conditions. Healthcare providers and institutions can work with advocacy organizations, patients, and families to assess emerging needs, improve access-including through the thoughtful use of telehealth-and consider unique advocacy needs when crafting new visitation policies. Research institutions should also ensure that ongoing research for RUD diagnosis and treatment is safely restarted and continued, as for other health conditions, such as cancer. Though the RUD community is medically heterogeneous, identifying their shared needs and proactively addressing them is essential, perhaps now more than ever, to ensure that these patients' already challenging relationship with the medical community is not further compromised.",
