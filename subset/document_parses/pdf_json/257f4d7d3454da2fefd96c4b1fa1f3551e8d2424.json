            "text": "Background: At the end of January 2021, Portugal had over 700,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The burden of COVID-19 varies between and within countries due to differences in contextual and individual factors, transmission rates, and clinical and public health interventions. Objectives: To identify high-risk areas, between April and October, on a weekly basis and at the municipality level, and to assess the temporal evolution of COVID-19, considering municipalities classified by incidence levels. Methods: This is an ecological study following a 3-step approach, i.e., (1) calculation of the relative risk (RR) of the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases, weekly, per municipality, using a spatial scan analysis; (2) classification of the municipalities according to the European Centre for Disease Control incidence categorization on November 19; and (3) characterization of RR temporal evolution by incidence groups. Results: Between April and October, the mean RR was 0.53, with a SD of 1.44, varying between 0 and 46.4. Globally, the north and Lisbon and Tagus Valley (LVT) area were the regions with the highest number of municipalities with a RR above 3.2. In April and beginning of May, most of the municipalities with an RR above 3.2 were from the north, while between May and August most mu-nicipalities with an RR above 3.2 were from LVT area. Comparing the incidence in November and retrospectively analyzing the RR showed the huge variation, with municipalities with an RR of 0 at a certain time classified as extremely high in November. Conclusions: Our results showed considerable variation in RR over time and space, with no consistent \"better\" or \"worst\" municipality. In addition to the several factors that influence COVID-19 transmission dynamics, there were some outbreaks over time and throughout the country and this may contribute to explaining the observed variation. Over time, on a weekly basis, it is important to identify critical areas allowing tailored and timely interventions in order to control outbreaks in early stages.",

M\u00e9todos: Estudo ecol\u00f3gico com uma abordagem em 3 fases: (1) C\u00e1lculo do risco relativo (RR) do n\u00famero de novos casos de COVID-19 notificados semanalmente, por munic\u00edpio, utilizando metodologia de an\u00e1lise espacial; (2) Classifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos munic\u00edpios de acordo com a categoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de incid\u00eancia do Centro Europeu para o Controlo de Doen\u00e7as (ECDC) a 19 de Novembro; (3) Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal do RR por grupos de incid\u00eancia. Resultados: Entre Abril e Outubro, a m\u00e9dia dos RR foi 0.53 com um desvio padr\u00e3o de 1.44, variando entre 0 e 46.4. Globalmente, o Norte e a \u00e1rea de Lisboa e Vale do Tejo (LVT) foram as regi\u00f5es com um maior n\u00famero de munic\u00edpios com RR acima de 3.2. Em Abril e no in\u00edcio de Maio, a maioria dos munic\u00edpios com RR acima de 3.2 eram do Norte, enquanto entre Maio e Agosto, a maioria dos munic\u00edpios com RR acima de 3.2 eram da \u00e1rea de LVT. Comparando a incid\u00eancia em Novembro e, analisando retrospetivamente, os RR apresentaram uma grande varia\u00e7\u00e3o, existindo munic\u00edpios, num determinado momento, com RR de 0, classificados como extremamente elevados, em Novembro. Conclus\u00f5es: Os riscos relativos apresentaram uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o consider\u00e1vel ao longo do per\u00edodo de tempo e espa\u00e7o analisados. Nenhum munic\u00edpio apresentou valores consistentemente \"melhores\" ou \"piores.\" Adicionalmente aos v\u00e1rios fatores que influenciam a din\u00e2mica de transmiss\u00e3o da COVID-19, a exist\u00eancia de v\u00e1rios surtos que foram ocorrendo ao longo de todo o territ\u00f3rio nacional, pode tamb\u00e9m ajudar a explicar a varia\u00e7\u00e3o observada.

The dependent variable corresponded to the weekly number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases divided by the population in each municipality. This methodology was proposed by Kulldorff and Nagarwalla [13] and tests the existence of significant spatial disease clusters. Each analysis results in an RR for each municipality, which can be higher than 1, 1, or lower than 1. For example, an RR equal to 1.2 for a given area translates into a 20% increased risk of a higher incidence of cases in that specific area compared with the rest of the country. To map RR the following rationale were used: (1) an initial class centered around 1 (RR reference value), adding 0.2 to the inferior and superior limit, creating a class 0.81-1.2, and (2) the 0.4 interval was applied to define 8 other intervals, with the first interval being between 0.0 and 0.4 and the last interval above 3.2. The geographical units were Portuguese municipalities (n = 308). SaTScan TM software was used, and circular window shapes and isotonic spatial scan statistics were applied [14] .",

The global mean RR was 0.53, with an SD of 1.44, varying between 0 (minimum) and 46.4 (maximum). The highest class created included RR above 3.2, corresponding to areas where the risk of having more cases was at least 3.2 higher than the rest of the country. These high critical areas were analyzed over time, and several municipalities were identified between April and October. The north and the Lisbon and Tagus Valley (LVT) area were the regions with a higher number of these high RR. In April and the beginning of May, most of the high critical municipalities were in the north region, while between May and August most of them were in the LVT area. In fact, Amadora, Sintra, Loures, and Odivelas, municipalities from the LVT area, were consistently identified with an RR above 3.2 between May 15 and July 31. In the middle of August, the highest RR was once again spotted in the north region. Over time, several municipalities with extremely high RR were associated with outbreaks, such as Reguengos de Monsaraz in June (RR = 43.9), Azambuja in May (RR = 5.8), Bombarral in June (RR = 4.6), Lagos in June (RR = 6.4), and Vimioso in September (RR = 22.9); most of them were in relatively small municipalities (in terms of population).",

As some authors explain, the dynamics of infectious diseases are influenced by person-to-person interactions, geographical distributions, contextual factors, lengths of latency, and humans' heterogeneous nature [16, 17] . CO-VID-19 emerged as a new disease in 2020, making case identification more complicated either because of the unknown duration of the infectious period or the unknown period to develop more severe symptoms. Due to unknown COVID-19 infectious mechanisms, and to a decrease in the reproduction ratio, massive public health interventions, such as lockdowns, hygiene measures, closing schools, and extensive travel restrictions were put in place internationally [18] . In some diseases, the geographical variation can be explained by common contextual factors, such as socioeconomic differences and individual factors. However, for COVID-19, the differences cannot be explained solely by those factors. Throughout the pandemic, several outbreaks were identified in specific settings, such as nursing homes [19, 20] , factories [21, 22] , or even after illegal parties [23] , which may explain why some areas peaked in a given period. However, when an outbreak spreads beyond its initial setting or its origin is unclear, control might be more difficult and take longer to achieve. If not controlled in due time, the outbreak can spread to other locations. Therefore, detailed identification of critical areas, in time and space, allows the implementation of timely interventions to control the spread of the pandemic.",

Public health interventions aim to reduce transmission rates, influencing several factors involved in transmission dynamics, such as population mobility. Overall, the mean monthly RR during June, July, and August were below 1 for most municipalities, which might be explained by behavioral changes during the holidays. In summer, there was a loosening of the measures implemented in previous months. This decrease might be due to the impact of previous lockdowns, which were still noticeable and might have been perceived as positive progress, leading to a false sense of security. On the other hand, individuals were more often outside, in open spaces, schools were closed, and individuals may have chosen to travel to isolated locations for holidays. The first lockdown, in Portugal, had a substantial impact on reduction of the number of cases, hospital admissions, and deaths during the first wave [9] . However, lockdowns should be the last resort, as these have a strong economic and social impact, and thus they should not be used constantly and/or for a long period of time. Gradually, these measures were loosened over time and adapted according to the municipality incidence. One should be aware that for every public health intervention implemented the natural transmission pattern is altered, which is often the aim. However, governments and populations should understand that returning to a normal life will take some time and be prepared for the implementation of future lockdowns if needed. This is an ecological study and has some limitations associated. The data used depend directly on notification rates, considering only already diagnosed cases. In the present study, it is also assumed that, despite the identified biases, the risk variation phenomenon is consistent across the country, varying in space and time.",
