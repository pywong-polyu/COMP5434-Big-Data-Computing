BMC Medicine (2022) 20:146 need intensive care and mechanical ventilation and have a higher fatality [2] , they were excluded from most COVID-19 vaccine trials [3] . There is considerable interest in establishing the safety and efficacy/effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in this population [4] . Several observational studies of vaccine effectiveness (VE) were recently conducted [5] [6] [7] [8] , but those studying pregnant women were restricted to mRNA vaccines [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . More doses of CoronaVac, an inactivated virus vaccine, have been administered than any other COVID-19 vaccine, mainly in low-and middle-income countries due to logistic constraints of cold chain and lower cost compared to mRNA vaccines. Many low-and middle-income countries are conducting vaccination campaigns using CoronaVac [5] , and some countries, like Brazil, offer CoronaVac to pregnant women. On January 17, 2021, the Brazilian Ministry of Health initiated COVID-19 vaccination with two CoronaVac doses and 2 to 4 weeks between doses (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). The policy followed internationally agreed priorities [14] . On March 15, 2021 , pregnant women with co-morbidities and in occupations considered, on balance, to be at high risk became eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccine [15] . On April 26, this recommendation was expanded to include all pregnant women [16] . Although the exact figures for pregnant women are unclear, we anticipated that enough pregnant women would have been vaccinated to make it possible to evaluate vaccine effectiveness in pregnant women: Brazil combines a sufficient vaccine coverage (more than 50% of the population with two doses) [17] , more than 21 million cases and 600,000 deaths (October 2021) [18] , and a considerable number of maternal deaths [19, 20] .",

This estimate is much lower than the effectiveness of 78 to 96% reported for pregnant women who received the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in Israel [9, 10] . CoronaVac VE has varied in different settings. The VE observed in this study is also lower than efficacy estimated in the general population in Chile [5] and Turkey studies [28] but comparable with effectiveness of 53% [29] reported for the general population, 47% [8] from elderly people and 38% among health care workers in Brazil [30] . However, this last group is highly exposed to COVID-19; therefore, vaccine effectiveness may be lower. The difference between our findings and those in the literature might be a result of several factors, including the interval between doses, risk of infection in the community, the predominant variant circulating during the study periods or pregnancy status. Pregnancy promotes resistance to generating proinflammatory antibodies compared to non-pregnant women, suggesting that pregnant women may not respond to some vaccines as effectively [31, 32] . We did not investigate biological mechanisms; further investigation is required to establish whether the lower effectiveness found is due to immunological changes during pregnancy. In contrast with other COVID-19 vaccines, such as the BNT162b2, which confers protection after the first dose [33] , CoronaVac was effective against symptomatic COVID-19 only after a complete regimen. This was also found in the older population in Brazil [8] . Since case fatality in pregnancy is higher than in the general population, the same level of protection would prevent more deaths in pregnant women.",

By using the TND, we have minimised bias related to access to health care, the occurrence of symptoms and health-seeking behaviour. In most populations, strong pressures have influenced who got tested for COVID-19. These biases can mean that those who get tested and test positive for SARS-CoV-2 may not be a random sample of all cases in the population. The assumption that underlies the TND is that people who seek testing and manage to get tested would be influenced by similar pressures regardless of vaccine status and the test outcome [26] ; thus, biases will 'cancel out' , and relatively unbiased estimates of effect can be obtained [26, 27] .",

The fact that the risk of COVID-19 increased in vaccinated women in the 2 weeks after the first dose is not biologically plausible and may indicate residual bias/confounding, which could lead to an underestimation of VE. A potential explanation for this would be if vaccinated subjects feel safer than unvaccinated subjects, such that unvaccinated subjects are more likely to seek testing for a symptom (not caused by COVID-19) that would not lead a vaccinated subject to test. This would result in a higher proportion of negative tests among the unvaccinated, leading to an apparent estimated increase in risk in the vaccinated, underestimating VE. Other potential explanations are that the process of accessing vaccination itself, e.g. use public transport, increased the risk of infection, or that recently vaccinated women, believing themselves to be reduced protective measures, leading to a peak of infection shortly after vaccination. A limitation intrinsic to the use and availability of secondary data is the limited choice of covariates and the potential for misclassifying vaccine status due to linkage failure.",

This has important repercussions for public health authorities, highlighting the importance of actively searching those delaying the second doses and promoting opportunities to vaccinate these women during regular prenatal care appointments. It is also important to explore the VE for the BNT162b2 vaccine among pregnant women in Brazil. If the results were similar to those observed in Israel, it seems reasonable to offer pregnant women vaccination using mRNA vaccines, followed by inactivated vaccines as the second option. Efficacy must continue to be monitored, in pregnant women as well as other groups, as new variants occur.",
