A novel pilot programme to assess the feasibility of weekly community RT-LAMP (Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification) testing [6, 7] for the SARS-CoV-2 virus using saliva samples collected at home was developed and piloted in a unique partnership (the Southampton COVID-19 Saliva Testing Programme) between Southampton City Council and the University of Southampton. Immediately on waking in the morning, the saliva samples were self-collected at home into specimen pots, which participants then dropped off at collection points for transfer to the testing laboratory. Direct RT-LAMP testing was undertaken using the OptiGene SARS-CoV-2 assay [8] ; an evaluation of the assay found an overall sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%, with a sensitivity of 94% in samples with a higher viral load(RT-qPCR ORF1ab CT values of < 25) [6] . Between June and October 2020, participants from two general practices in Southampton, staff and students at the University of Southampton and staff and pupils from one infant, one junior, one primary and one secondary school in the city were invited to participate in two phases of a pilot of the Southampton COVID-19 Saliva Testing Programme. The four schools had catchment areas in more deprived parts of the city, and the pupils were from diverse ethnic backgrounds. More than a quarter of students at the University of Southampton come from outside the UK. Interactive engagement activities took place alongside the testing programme to maximise uptake of saliva testing, with extensive development and deployment of educational materials targeting different age groups of students and pupils in the schools, alongside work to engage university students.",

Theory on promotion-and -prevention-focused motivation was used to explain why people did and did not take part. Promotionand -prevention theory suggests that people balance the motivation to fulfil basic needs with the desire to maintain safety and security [27] . Promotion activities generate gains for people in terms of social connectedness and reductions in anxiety, for example, where prevention activities are those that minimise risk and loss of those gains. Bandura's concept of collective efficacy was applied to descriptions of differences in engagement between the organisations and communities involved [28] .

Automatic registration of all school students may also have normalised participation in the testing programme, where university students had to make the decision to register as individuals. University students suggested that taking part in the testing programme could be normalised by employing testing champions in their halls and courses to promote the programme and by using an 'opt-out' process for participation. School pupils and university students were offered interactive educational activities being run to increase engagement with the testing programme. Those who took part in these activities reported understanding more about the science involved in managing the pandemic, which they felt increased their motivation to protect their communities.

The local NHS Foundation Trust and its partnership with the University and Southampton City Council, however, was trusted; it was seen to have scientific integrity, and as a local organisation, was felt to be answerable to the Southampton community in a way NHS Test and Trace was not. Some suggested that they would have been more likely to take part if the programme was run solely by local organisations. Participants and decliners were clear that building trust was necessary to improve engagement in the programme. They suggested that this would be helped by receiving more directed information from credible sources such as the University and Southampton City Council about the rationale for and design of the programme, about data protection and the accuracy of the tests, and about the progress of the programme.

            "text": "Individual participants and organisational representatives provided valuable insights into the experience of engaging with the Southampton COVID-19 Saliva Testing Programme, leading to changes in programme processes and communications, which undoubtedly increased engagement and adherence to programme requirements. They also made important observations about the benefits they experienced from engaging with the testing programme. This is known as promotion-focused motivation which describes a focus on what can be gained from a health behaviour or intervention [27] . Participants suggested that promotion-focused motivation for engaging in testing should be emphasised to potential participants by those running the programme. One of the benefits that participants in the programme emphasised was increased knowledge of the science behind management of the pandemic that school and university students gained from the educational engagement activities. As well as providing insights, it was clear from the focus groups and interviews that the process of seeking feedback from participants also increased the engagement of local people with the testing programme. Prevention-focused motivation theory would suggest that programme promotors should understand and address the value to potential participants of preventing the loss of what they already have [27] . In the case of the saliva testing programme, this would refer to their ability to go to work or school or to socialise if they tested positive. It was felt by decliners and by those who knew people who had declined to take part, that it might be best to remain ignorant of their viral status if it meant that they could continue earning money, for example. Programme implementors need to work on schemes that provide support such as financial aid to those who cannot work if they test positive and to increase emphasis of the benefits such as being able to socialise on receipt of a negative test and continuing to follow national guidance. Involving local people and organisations in the development and piloting of programmes in this way may well have been important in ensuring community buy-in [30] . They appreciated the chance to contribute to this programme, which they saw to be of national importance. The process of holding the conversations reported in this paper may also have helped to address two key underlying issues affecting engagement with the testing programme: the need for trust between participants and testing programmes, and the role of 'collective efficacy' within organisations. Local organisations, such as schools and the University were seen to be answerable to local people and hence more trustworthy than more national 'faceless' and private organisations such as NHS Test and Trace. Collective efficacy is a group's shared belief in its capability to organise and execute actions required to achieve goals [28] , and a sense of collective efficacy appeared to be stronger in the smaller, more cohesive organisations such as the schools and GP practices than in the University, for example. Schools and GP practices had staff and student communities within which members through daily conversation and mutual encouragement made regular testing the 'social norm' . The educational engagement activities appeared to play an important role in this too. Students' increased knowledge appeared to make them more engaged with the programme and motivated by the need to protect their communities, as well as making them feel like they had more agency in controlling the spread of the virus and its damaging consequences. Schools and the University were thus building collective efficacy for regular testing.",

            "text": "A rapid qualitative evaluation enabled real-time feedback of insights into perceptions and functioning of the testing programme, improving the participants' experience and was therefore likely to increase uptake of testing. Whilst some of these insights confirm what has been learnt during previous epidemics, our study was necessary to understand more precisely how to improve specific features of the programme which would facilitate participation. Table 3 details how insights gathered through the interviews and focus group discussions led to modifications to the programme in order to increase engagement. Insights gained were also used to inform university, schools, and city-wide strategies for managing the pandemic and to feed-back to national and local government [31] . This included evaluation reports to the UK Department of Health and Social Care [31] and presentations to the UK Department for Education based on the findings in this rapid qualitative evaluation. Figure 1 illustrates the way in which the rapid qualitative evaluation influenced Saliva Testing Programme development and wider testing strategy. This study has also produced actionable recommendations for improving engagement with COVID-19 testing programmes across the UK (Table 3) . See Table 4 for details of these recommendations. Table 3 Modifications to the Saliva Testing Programme 1. Resolved initial technical hurdles in the registration process and moved towards a more robust yet simple registration process in Phase II to reduce the barriers of registering; 2. Created clear and simple instructions, which were translated into seven languages, to reduce the number of inconclusive saliva test results; 3. Designed smaller labels to stick to the test pots to reduce the number of people placing them incorrectly and increasing the risk of receiving an inconclusive result; 4. Testing team communicated the test's accuracy and the progress of the programme in a weekly newsletter to schools and through emails to university staff and students; 5. Educational engagement activities were offered to university students to increase their involvement in the programme; 6. Commitment has been made to reduce the amount of plastic and to recycle containers in the next phase of the programme; 7. Post-boxes rather than team members placed at sample drop-off points to reduce possibility of transmission; 8. Increased number of drop-off points in Southampton to reduce the travel time for participants submitting their tests; 9. 'Toolkit' created for programme implementers to support preparation and roll-out for the next phase of the programme. Table 4 Recommendations from the Southampton Saliva Testing Programme to ensure mass engagement in testing for COVID-19 1 . Testing should be delivered through local organisations (e.g. local authorities, universities, schools, hospitals) to both increase trust in the testing programme but also to promote collective efficacy; 2. Communications about testing should be clear, consistent and appeal to individual's sense of community and altruism to motivate people to take part in the programme; 3. Creative and fun educational activities should be used to improve knowledge and understanding of the virus, so increasing motivation to protect each other and sense of agency in managing consequences of the pandemic; 4. Participants and local organisers should be involved in designing their programme and should be engaged in providing continuous feedback on the testing experience to enable real-time programme modifications. Involvement might be in advisory meetings, or through contributions to focus groups and interviews, or engagement in education activities; 5. Local organisations involved in delivering testing should be enabled to connect with one another to share best practice and create a local testing culture. Meetings between local organisations should be a routine part of the of the programme and continue throughout; 6. Those testing positive should be supported financially, psychologically, with food and medication and provided with reassurance and advice about how to minimise the possibility of transmission of infection to others; 7. Testing should be made as convenient for participants as possible, many of the types of modifications described in Table 3 achieved this aim, and all communications need to be in multiple languages as well as appropriate for children and young people; 8. Thought needs to be given to making testing kits and processes environmentally sustainable by reducing the number of plastic bags and tubes and recycling materials wherever possible.",

These steps are part of an established process for conducting rapid qualitative evaluation [16] . Accessing those who declined to take part in the programme was challenging, and we may not have identified all the reasons people have for not taking part in this type of testing programme. Those who were consulted, however, offered important insights that informed significant programme development. In common with other qualitative data, ours may not represent the views of all participants and decliners of the saliva testing programme. It is the intention of qualitative research to represent instead the range and diversity of participant views, that we believe is what this study has achieved. Future evaluations of testing programmes should seek to engage more people who decline to be tested and explore participants' experiences of indirect NHS Test and Trace contact tracing and household isolation as these are key components of the effectiveness of population testing.",
