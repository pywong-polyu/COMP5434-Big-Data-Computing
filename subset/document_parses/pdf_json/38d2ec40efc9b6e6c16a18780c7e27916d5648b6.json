Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, closed online survey among 2053 factory workers in Shenzhen, China, implemented from September 1 to 7, 2020. Participants of the online survey were full-time employees aged 18 years or over who had resumed work in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive physical examinations once a year. Eligible workers attending six designated physical examination sites were invited to complete an online survey. This study was based on a subsample of those who had at least one child under the age of 18 years (N=1052). After being briefed that COVID-19 vaccines developed by China are likely to be available by the end of 2020, participants were asked about their likelihood of having their children under the age of 18 years take up free COVID-19 vaccination provided by the government, if it existed. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations of perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and exposure to information related to COVID-19 through social media with parental acceptability, after controlling for significant background characteristics.",

Regarding social media influence, higher exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17-1.56). Higher exposure to negative information related to COVID-19 vaccination was negatively associated with the dependent variable (AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99).

Moreover, it is difficult to recover the economy completely before all children can safely return to schools and parents can resume full-time work [10] .

            "text": "Mathematic modeling suggested that if the COVID-19 vaccine efficacy was 80%, the coverage would have to achieve at least 75% to extinguish the ongoing pandemic [11] . Therefore, a timely understanding of community responses to the forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines are important for policy making and service planning. For children under the age of 18 years, parents are usually the decision makers regarding their children's vaccination. Hence, it is important to understand parents' acceptability of their children's COVID-19 vaccination and related barriers and facilitators. To our knowledge, at least one study investigated parents' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children [12] . This was an online survey conducted in the United Kingdom, which showed that 48.2% of parents or guardians would definitely accept COVID-19 vaccination for their children aged 18 months or under [12] . Belief that COVID-19 vaccination could protect their children and other family members and belief that it would facilitate their return to normal life were major reasons for parents' acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination for their children [12] . Their concerns were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness [12] . These factors were considered by this study. We applied the theory of planned behavior (TPB) as the theoretical framework in this study [13] . The TPB postulates that behavioral intention to adopt a health-related behavior (eg, having children take up COVID-19 vaccination) is a strong predictor of actual behavior. In order to form such an intention, one would evaluate the pros and cons of the behavior (ie, positive and negative attitudes), consider whether their significant others would support such behavior (ie, perceived subjective norm), and appraise how much control one has over the behavior (ie, perceived behavioral control) [13] . In recent studies, the TPB has been used successfully to explain vaccination behaviors [14] [15] [16] .",

Verbal consent was obtained instead of written consent to allow participants to maintain anonymity. We developed an online questionnaire using Questionnaire Star (Changsha Ranxing Information Technology Co), a commonly used online survey platform in China. Quick response (QR) codes were generated to access the online questionnaire. Prospective participants were asked to scan the QR code on-site to complete the survey. Each mobile device was allowed to access the online questionnaire once to avoid duplicate responses. The participants were asked not to disseminate the QR codes that were used to access the survey to other people. The survey had 66 items, approximately 15 items per page for four pages, which took about 15 minutes to complete. The online survey platform performed completeness checks before each questionnaire was submitted. Participants were able to review and change their responses through a back button. In case there was more than one child under the age of 18 years within their household, participants referred to the one whose birthday was closest to the survey date when answering questions [20] . Upon completion of the survey, an electronic coupon of \u00a510 (US $1.30) was sent to participants. All data were stored in the server of the online survey platform and were protected by a password.

It is useful to increase positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination, as this was a facilitator. In addition to the beneficial effect for their children (eg, prevent COVID-19 effectively), health communication messages should also emphasize to parents that having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination would result in herd immunization, which could contribute to COVID-19 control. Building up confidence related to vaccine supply may also be a useful strategy. Over half of participants perceived that their family members would support them in having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination. Such perception was also a facilitator. Future health promotion should enhance parents' knowledge of COVID-19 vaccination and encourage them to discuss their children's vaccination with other family members in order to obtain support from these significant others. It is also useful to enhance perceived behavioral control, as this was another facilitator. There is much room for improvement. Multiple strategies may be applied in future COVID-19 vaccination programs, which may include simplification of the procedures to obtain vaccination and school-based vaccination programs. Relatively few participants had concerns related to side effects, duration of vaccine protection, children's apprehension, or other logistical issues.

            "text": "Our findings suggested that COVID-19 vaccination triggered intensive responses on social media among Chinese parents, as about 70% of the participants were sometimes or always exposed to information specific to COVID-19 vaccination on different social media platforms. Exposure to content about positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination, such as promising vaccine efficacy, was associated with higher parental acceptability. This is understandable, as this type of information can increase parents' confidence in COVID-19 vaccines and reduce their concerns. Higher exposure to negative information about COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower parental acceptability. Previous studies showed that people were more likely to absorb negative rather than positive information during a disease outbreak [23] . Although social media is a powerful tool for disseminating information, there are concerns related to inaccurate data, unverified rumors, and even malicious misinformation on these platforms [24] . A global epidemic of misinformation has been spreading through social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, which might pose challenges for future COVID-19 vaccination programs [25, 26] . The findings highlighted the importance of transparency in communicating about the vaccine development process and vaccine safety testing. Public health authorities should also identify and verify misinformation in a timely manner. Studies showed that a major vaccine incident (ie, the Changchun Changsheng vaccine incident) had significantly impaired confidence in vaccines among Chinese people [27] . However, in our study, negative information about these vaccine incidents did not influence parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. This is one of the first studies investigating parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination in China. It used the TPB as a theoretical framework and the sample size was relatively large. However, it has a number of limitations. First, we only included parents who were factory workers, as this was a secondary analysis. In 2018, 34.3% of Shenzhen's population were factory workers [28] . However, failure to include parents with other occupations or those without full-time work was one major limitation of this study and limited the representativeness of our sample. In addition, participants were recruited in one Chinese city. Generalization should be made cautiously. Second, since the study was anonymous and did not collect participants' identification, we were not able to collect information about those who refused to join the study. Parents who refused to join the study might have different characteristics as compared to study participants. Selection bias might exist. Our response rate was relatively high as compared to other online surveys of similar topics [12] . Third, there was a lack of methodological innovation in this study. The aim of this study was to provide timely information to facilitate the promotion and service planning related to COVID-19 vaccination in China. Fourth, we did not ask about parental acceptability that was conditional on different cost scenarios. It is common for the Chinese government to provide free vaccination to priority groups in order to increase coverage. Since children were considered as one of the priority groups to receive COVID-19 vaccination, it is possible for the government to offer free vaccines to this group. Fifth, data were self-reported and verification was not feasible. Recall bias might exist. Participants might also overreport their acceptability due to social desirability. Moreover, most items and scales used in this study were self-constructed based on those from previous studies on parental acceptability of human papillomavirus vaccination in China [20] . The internal reliabilities of these scales were acceptable, but these scales may require external validation. Furthermore, this was a cross-sectional study and could not establish a causal relationship.",

The TPB is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination targeting parents. Enhancing positive attitudes, creating a supportive subjective norm, and increasing parents' perceived behavioral control related to their children's COVID-19 vaccination are potentially useful health promotion strategies. Transparency in communicating about the vaccine development process and vaccine safety testing is important. Public health authorities should also address misinformation in a timely manner.",
