This study aimed to determine the limitations in activity and the influences of remote exercise training on communitydwelling older adults during a state of emergency in Japan. [Participants and Methods] In May 2020, during the COVID-19 state of emergency, we carried out a mail survey of community-dwelling older adults who had previously participated in a disability prevention program in Ami town, Ibaraki, Japan. The mail included a brochure on exercises and a DVD. The attached exercise program was comprised of 10 different exercises, which could be conducted in approximately 30 minutes.",

There were significant reductions (19.2-22.5%) in the perceived exercise load for each posture after two weeks of remote exercise training with DVD (n=26). [Conclusion] Our results suggested that the remote exercise training with the brochure and DVD may be effective. Since this study involved a small number of participants, future studies should involve larger populations.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced physical activity among both adults and older adults in locked down countries 8, 9) . In Japan, people requested a stayat-home order rather than a lockdown, and it was reported that physical activity declined compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic 10, 11) . These results suggest that the physical activity of the older adults (including those with diseases) similarly decreased in different regions of Japan. In healthy or frail older adults, muscular weakness is decreased by physical activity ranging from low-intensity walking to more vigorous sports and resistance exercises 12) . However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to increase one's physical activity using conventional approaches (i.e., hobbies, exercises, salons) while maintaining social distancing. New interventions, such as mobile technology and web-based services [13] [14] [15] [16] , are being attempted to maintain physical activity levels. We should increase the physical activity levels of community-dwelling older adults using a method that also considers infection control, and here we encouraged remote exercising using a simple method (brochure and DVD).",

Few respondents answered, but all continued to exercise daily. There are several types of remote exercises, and a review reported that using mobile health technology is effective for older adults 17) . However, previous studies targeted individuals over 50 years of age, a different generation from the present study's target population, and their adaptation to mobile technology tends to occur slowly. Therefore, considering the feasibility and acceptance of older adults, we used a brochure and DVD for the remote exercise. These results suggest that this approach is effective and feasible for encouraging remote exercising in situations in which social distancing is necessary.",

First, the sample in this study were not randomly selected. The participants might have been highly motivated to improve their health and exercise because they had previously participated in a disability prevention program. For this reason, the generalization of the results requires caution. Second, the response rate was relatively low (38.2%). In particular, a bias may exist in the survey as only 26 participants continued to exercise regularly, and only those who had positive effects responded to it. Third, we had to use an easy questionnaire and could not quantitatively measure physical activity and muscle strength. Finally, this was a cross-sectional survey of specific areas during a state of emergency that identified no changes over time. The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented worldwide and changing daily. In these socially chaotic situations, self-reported responses may vary depending on when and where data are collected.",

Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the older adults who exercised while watching DVDs had reduced perceived load of exercise. Even in circumstances where it is difficult to gather and conduct activities while maintaining social distancing, it is suggested that instructing people to exercise at home using the brochure and DVD in the form of remote engagement may be beneficial.",
