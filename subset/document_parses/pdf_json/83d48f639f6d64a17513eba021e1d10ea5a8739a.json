            "text": "Telemedicine is an integration of technology and medicine. 1 Telemedicine is the way to provide better health care to people in isolated, difficult access areas or zones suffering from a shortage of health services. 2 One of the objectives of telemedicine is to provide equal access to medical expertise irrespective of the geographical location of the person in need. It is more efficacious and extremely useful especially where experts are rare, distances are large, and/or infrastructure is limited. 3 The first experiences of telemedicine date at the beginning of the previous century, when in 1903, Einthoven transmitted the first electrocardiogram. Radiotelegraphy was also used from 1920 for assisting patients onboard ships, which represent the prototype of remote and isolated places. 4 Modern telemedicine techniques have been underdevelopment for nearly 50 years by Wittson and colleagues, which were the first to employ IATV for medical purposes. 5 In 1959, they used a microwave link for telepsychiatry consultations between the Nebraska Psychiatric Institute in Omaha and the state mental hospital 112 miles away. In the 1970 and 1980s, limited telemedicine projects were instituted at several sites in North America and Australia, including the Space Technology Applied to Rural Papa go Advanced Health Care (STARPAHC) project of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in southern Arizona, a project at Logan Airport in Boston, Mass, and programs in northern Canada. 6 Except for the assistance to ships with no medical facilities onboard, which are now assisted by specialized institutions called Telemedical Maritime Assistance Services (TMAS), a 20-year-old telemedicine program at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, St-John's, none of the programs born before 1986 has survived. Although data are limited, the early reviews and evaluations of those programs suggest that the equipment was reasonably effective at transmitting the information needed for most clinical uses and that users were, for the most part, satisfied. 7 Telemedicine has a strong impingement in developing countries since it allows remote areas of a country to get access to medical care and to create local knowledge. 8 It is a flourishing industry, valued at billions of dollars globally. 9 It has been of particular interest for the past few years due to its ability to transcend the common barriers, which prevent people from accessing health care. 10 These include long distances to a functional health facility, lack of doctors in rural areas, and the high cumulative costs associated with a doctor's visit (cost of transportation, income lost due to time off work, and the doctor's fee).",

By using information technologies (IT) and mobile health (mHealth) services like SMS and call remainders, patients can reach adequate selfmanagement of hypertension and diabetes from home. 14,18 This will significantly enhance their self-management and help to reduce disease complications in the future. Mobile services can also effectively help public health authorities and managers during vaccine campaigns 15 and immunization uptake among infants.16 Moreover, they could promote patient data collection, analysis, and overall health management. Another video-based education study on post-stroke patients from the neurology ward at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) in Karachi has shown the effectiveness of these programs on boosting stroke-related mortalities and change in functional status among stroke survivors.20",

Like in other emerging markets, there is neglect for healthcare in general, with Pakistan having spent only 0.9% of its GDP on healthcare in 2014, which was the lowest in all of Asia. 9 Approximately 61% of the Pakistani population lives in rural areas. Realizing all the promise that telemedicine holds in revolutionizing health care in emerging markets, the governments of India, Bangladesh, Kenya, and Uganda, among others have implemented telemedicine programs that are providing health care through either audio, video, text messages, and different applications (apps). These programs have revolved around maternal and child health, pregnancy, prevention, and diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), etc. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, implemented 487 unique telemedicine programs from 2006 to 2016.11 In more advanced markets, like India, companies are now beginning to develop chatbots, using artificial intelligence (AI) to solve common healthcare problems. With solutions of this type, patients do not need to visit the doctor for minor ailments at all.12 With so much exciting news coming from emerging markets, one must ask the question, where does Pakistan stand in all this? According to the World Health Organization (WHO) telemedicine survey of 2016, Pakistan has no telemedicine laws or regulations in place.9",

There is little funding for residents in rural areas to satisfy emergency care needs, such as stroke and serious injury.2,29 The widespread reception and eventual progress of any new technology depend primarily on factors such as familiarity and appreciation of the innovation by consumers. The same is true for the skills needed for the successful application of these technologies and the working atmosphere that is conducive to their introduction. We, therefore, need studies to evaluate mHealth interventions such as SMS, automated calls, applications, and telemedicine technologies, which should be successfully incorporated into Pakistan's healthcare system.21 4.3 | Possible implicationsTelehealth and mHealth innovations have been complemented with the introduction and use of portable sensors and self-care gadgets such as glucometers, mobile blood pressure controls, pulse oximeters, and optical stethoscopes in concomitance with the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of such technologies, as required by the pandemic, has expanded telehealth applications. A new boom in breakthrough innovations has occurred in Pakistan due to concerns of COVID-19 contracting and social distance stress. In the last few months, social distancing has led to this technology becoming much more important as a support mechanism and to improve the use of other technologies.30,31 The COVID-19 pandemic presented Pakistan with an unexpected chance to solve many of the health issues by telehealth. It is time for Pakistan to discuss the use of this kind of technology in health care and to engage doctors, public health, and information technology experts to consider a variety of obstacles ahead. The implementation of policies and the establishment of adherence and monitoring mechanisms will be a major challenge.Besides the information technology network infrastructure, qualified personnel would be needed to ensure long-term progress in telehealth and mHealth. In general, Pakistan needs a priority on health policy at all levels. With the use of information technologies, the emerging technologies could represent an enhancer necessary for a healthcare review at the government and hospital levels.32 4.4 | LimitationsA main limitation of the study is in the small number of studies reviewed, which, on the other hand, have diverse and often restrictive inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most of the inclusive studies adopted similar methods such as cross-sectional or random trials that restrict the research variety. Another limitation is the absence of quantitative studies, and this can generate knowledge gaps. The choice to exclude from this work studies published more than 15 years ago may have also missed some papers from our analysis. Digital health-based interventions such as mHealth, eHealth, telehealth, and telemedicine are increasingly becoming part of Pakistan's current health infrastructure. The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has created considerable potential and impetus to create innovative telehealth technologies that can improve health care and people's lives both in urban and rural regions of the country. There are already major challenges and barriers. However, amid all the obstacles, digital health continues to grow through the efforts of various stakeholders in both the public and private sectors. It is impossible to determine how successful these approaches have been, as not all interventions have been evaluated or reported. A well-informed policy and business environment affecting both related public and private health and IT stakeholders are required to drive scale and viability for the services to be effective. A constructive cycle of policy, execution, and assessment to educate state, provincial, district, and communitylevel policies would generate the platform needed to introduce more and better eHealth programs to benefit people and health workers in Pakistan.",
