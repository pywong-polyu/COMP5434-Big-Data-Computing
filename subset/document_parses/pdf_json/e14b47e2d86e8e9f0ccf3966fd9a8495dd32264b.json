It does so by deploying a multi-step investigation of the issues from four perspectives: transportation corridors, spheres of influence, centrality, and observed spatial patternseach leading us to connections between retail spaces and planning of African cities. Our analyses of 22 traditional satellite markets in Kumasi are distilled into four key findings. First, these markets emerge along, and at the intersection of, intra-and inter-urban road networks as a means of granting local access to indigenous goods and services. Second, the spatial distribution and spheres of influence of the markets partly support Christaller's hypothesis regarding the willingness of people to travel far distances to access higher-order goods and services. The hypothesis fails, however, to recognize that some traditional markets can still have high spheres of influence without providing higher-order goods and services because they constitute vital nodes in the rural-urban food networks. Third, we find a spatial clustering of these markets, suggesting agglomerative tendencies among the markets. Finally, we argue that the observed spatio-social patterns of Kumasi's retailscape only make sense if they are situated within the city's modernist urban planning imaginaries. Specifically, the city's retailscape embodies ongoing placemaking strategies, which involve the expropriation of urban spaces from traders to modernize the cityscape.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Retail spaces and marketplaces support and sustain urban life and vitality.

This in-depth analysis is especially necessary because, since the recession in the 1980s, studies have called attention to the importance of spatializing the politics of retail spaces to reveal, for instance, the inequities embedded within retailing and urban development processes.

The fluidity of retailscapes constitutes perspectival constructs or \"imagined worlds [communities]\" (Appadurai, 1996, 33) , where multiple landscapes (e.g., space, politics, culture, economics) simultaneously converge and disperse through global and local forces. Such a broad view of retailscapes, allows us to unpack, for example, the linked spatiality and politics of retail development, which manifests prominently through municipal governments' use of retail development as a tool for local economic regeneration. For instance, Sager (2011) discusses the emergence of retail parks and up-market residential blocks as the physical embodiment of the changing spatiality of urban entrepreneurship in many cities within the UK (see also Lovering, 2007) . Some also argue that the spatiality of neoliberal urban governance is manifesting in African cities through urban tourism and local economic development planning in Johannesburg (Rogerson, 2011) and Cape Town (Peyton et al., 2015) , and urban fantasy plans in Kigali, Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Kinshasa, and Lagos (Watson, 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 135, "text": "Appadurai (1996, 33)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 485, "end": 506, "text": "(Appadurai, 1996, 33)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 918, "end": 930, "text": "Sager (2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1138, "text": "Lovering, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1335, "text": "(Rogerson, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1371, "text": "(Peyton et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1467, "text": "(Watson, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "This article spatializes the politics of retailscapes in ways that reveal the ongoing moments of dispossessions and accumulation in Africa. It pursues this by addressing two critical limitations in the literature. First, Rogerson and Rogerson (2010) noted that existing studies on how retailing, urban development, and local economic development planning is unfolding in African cities focuses more on South Africa and less on other African cities. This article takes up a piece of this challenge by focusing on the retailscape of a rapidly developing city in Ghana: Kumasi. By focusing on the retailscape of Kumasi, this article seeks to advance the conversation on retailing and local economic development by focusing on a specific retailscape: traditional marketplaces. In doing so, we are particularly interested in shining light on how these traditional marketplaces co-exist with emerging transnational shopping malls and remain resilient and relevant in the face of a hostile urban planning environment (see Abrahams, 2009; Humphrey, 2007) . Discussions on resilient marketplaces remain increasingly relevant, especially in global South cities, as the SARS-COV-2 pandemic urges us to re-think how multi-scalar planning policies reinforce, or otherwise, the resilience of (informal) marketplaces amid political-economic and public health risks. 1 Second, and finally, apart from the disproportionate focus on South African cities, the literature is also inadvertently skewed towards \"supermarketization\" (Peyton et al., 2015, 39) and its role in the socio-spatial transformation of African cities (e.g. Tschirley et al., 2015; Weatherspoon & Reardon, 2003; D'Haese & Van Huylenbroeck, 2005) . Even though Peyton et al. (2015) focus on the expansion of supermarkets in Cape Town, they insightfully note that focusing on supermarketization and retail modernization at the expense of traditional markets limits broader understanding of, and nuanced conversations about, retailscapes and ongoing urban development processes in African cities. This lopsided conversation in the literature, which this article attempts to remediate, largely ignores the historical and politico-cultural factors that contribute to the resiliency of traditional marketplaces in Africa (Humphrey, 2007; Peyton et al., 2015) . More broadly, how political-economic landscapes (manifesting through urban planning and local economic development strategies) support or constrain the resiliency of these traditional marketplaces in the face of rising supermarketization is an overarching research question, to which this article makes a modest and foundational contribution in answering.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 221, "end": 249, "text": "Rogerson and Rogerson (2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1030, "text": "Abrahams, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1046, "text": "Humphrey, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1352, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1510, "end": 1535, "text": "(Peyton et al., 2015, 39)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1609, "end": 1632, "text": "Tschirley et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1662, "text": "Weatherspoon & Reardon, 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1696, "text": "D'Haese & Van Huylenbroeck, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1731, "text": "Peyton et al.

The economics of retail geography, which was traditionally rooted in Christaller's (1933) central place theory and the Chicago School's ecological approach (Park et al., 1925) , looked at the location and functional hierarchies of retail centers (Saraiva & Pinho, 2017). Christaller's central place theorem looked at city structure as being shaped by the relationship between urban centers, transportation routes, and market centers (Dale & Sj\u00f8holt, 2007; Christaller, 1933) . Urban morphology, according to the Chicago School, is shaped by trading relations between the city center and its hinterlands (e.g., suburban or peri-urban areas), but activities in the city center shape what happens in the hinterlands (Dear and Flusty 2002; Park et al., 1925) . In applying ideas by Christaller and the Chicago School to traditional retail geography, Berry (1963) , for instance, found that Chicago's retail landscape in the 1960s involved (1) an intermix of service, household supplies, and street corner retail outlets, (2) different types of specialized functional areas, and (3) distinct hierarchy of planned and unplanned retail centers located differently within higher and lower-income neighborhoods (see also Berry & Parr, 1988) . Morrill (1987) built on Berry's work by also showing the intra-urban hierarchy, functional specializations, and adaptability of planned and unplanned retail centers in Seattle. By examining the impact of consumer behavior on retail location, Dawson (1980) noted that traditional economic geography highlighted the need for policies to influence retail location decisions. Crewe (2000, 275) averred that the traditional or orthodox economics view of retail geography paid attention to \"store location, location, location,\" which limited systematic theoretical advancements 1 While this article is limited in scope, future works should engage in in-depth theorizing of resilient marketplaces (see for example, Tucker and Nelson, 2017) , especially in global South cities.

In reviewing the landscape of the new retail geography, Lowe and Wrigley (2000) discussed the ongoing socio-spatial changes in urban areas through economic and cultural lenses. From an economic standpoint, Lowe and Wrigley (2000) presented seven themes embodying the new retail geography: reconfiguring corporate retail structures, power relations between retailers and suppliers, technological and organizational transformations in retail distribution, retail employment relations, regulation and governance, spatial switching of retail capital, and configured, manipulated and contested nature of retail spaces (see also Doel, 1996 Doel, , 1999 . From a cultural standpoint, the new retail geography probed consumption and retailing spaces as co-constitutive sites that reproduce meanings and consumption identities and subjectivities (Cook et al., 2000; Crewe, 2000) . Thus, the cultural logic of the new retail geography, according to Lowe and Wrigley (2000) , looks at four main sites, which are restructuring consumption and retail experiences and identities in urban areas: street, mall, store, and home. In addition to these four sites, Crewe (2000, 278) also noted that there are \"inconspicuous retailing and consumption spaces,\" which include car-boot sales, retro-vintage shops, charity shops, cyber and virtual shops (i.e. internet and television), and market catalogues (see also Graham, 1998; Kitchen, 1998) .

Some blamed these limitations on the weakness of the central place theory to adequately account for the behavior of retailers and consumers (Scott, 1970) .

For example, some studies have looked at the interactions of retailers, consumers, and other actors in different environments (Dawson et al., 2008; Hamilton, Senauer, and Petrovic 2011) .

The majority of these studies, however, developed a quantitative and locational analysis of traditional marketplaces and their relationship to people and other land uses. Guyer et al.

These traditional retail areas comprise a natural clustering of individuals selling goods that are arranged in baskets, under umbrellas, within market stalls, along the streets, and sometimes even in commuter vehicles (e.g., buses and minivans). Hence, although it is relatively easy to locate a traditional marketplace, it is very problematic to disaggregate individual retail shops within specific markets by showing their locations using parcel-level data as pursued in some studies (e.g., Araldi & Fusco, 2019; Jensen, 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1048, "end": 1069, "text": "Araldi & Fusco, 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1083, "text": "Jensen, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Traditional marketplaces: promises and challenges for retail geography and planning"}, {"text": "Second, a unique feature of Africa's retail geography is the periodic nature of traditional markets.

Discussed later, we analyze traditional marketplaces by documenting and incorporating into our analysis the different goods and services provided by the clustering of individuals within a given marketplace. We also pay attention to the specific local built environment factors that influence the form and function of these traditional marketplaces. Thus, even though there is the absence of parcel-level data to conduct advanced network and geoprocessing analyses on these marketplaces, we learn and draw from multiple methods in our initial attempt to analyze the emerging retailscapes of African cities. Finally, the underlying cultural logics of marketplaces in Africa supports the need to complement economic-cultural and quantitative-qualitative analyses of retailscapes in African countries. We conduct qualitative analyses involving interviews with market women and other stakeholders to understand the socio-cultural and political dynamics embedded within our quantitative analysis.

The city is Ghana's central economic hub and performs a wide range of economic, social, and traditional functions. Historically, Kumasi developed around its strength in trade and exchange (Amoako & Adom-Asamoah, 2018) . Then located strategically at the crossroads of the trans-Saharan trade routes, which contributed significantly to its wealth (Korboe, 2001, 41) , the emerging Kumasi township acted as a trading hub for gold, weapons, slaves as well as farm implements (Amoako & Korboe, 2011) . The city has since become an important trade center, connecting Ghana to its sub-regional counterparts. Specifically, the marketplaces in Kumasi, such as the Kumasi Central Market (also known as the Kejetia Market), have long served as critical economic hubs in Ghana and for other African countries such as Cote D'Ivoire, Togo, and Niger (Adarkwa, 2011; Clark, 1994) .

As a result, one of the traders in the Bantama market noted how insecure she feels about her tenure in the market: \"The KMA can decide to move us out of this market [Bantama Market] if they decide one day to construct another beautiful market like the one in Kejetia.\" 6 As the KMA engages in what Watson (2014) sees as urban fantasy planning, we observe instances of neoliberal placemaking strategies in African cities, and also in the UK and other developed countries (Lowe, 2005) , which speak to how marketplaces have become the epicenter of neoliberal placemaking strategies for local economic development planning.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 125, "text": "Gillespie (2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 213, "end": 226, "text": "Bansah, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 987, "end": 1000, "text": "Watson (2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1171, "text": "(Lowe, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and findings"}, {"text": "While some traders were worried about not having secured tenure in the satellite markets, others were more optimistic about their relocation to these satellite markets.

Traders in the Abinkyi market were more optimistic about relocating to this satellite market: \"I think everything is working out well for us when we moved to this [Abinkyi] market.

Konongo, one of the communities within Abinkyi market's sphere of influence, connects this market to the food-producing communities within Konongo and surrounding agrarian rural communities.

We were thus interested in understanding whether this is an instance of 'the chicken or the egg causality dilemma': are traders happy before or after moving to specific satellite markets? In other words, what factors motivate traders to site their businesses at specific satellite markets? For evicted traders, the decision of where to move next is about finding available spaces in another marketplace or along a street. In our interview with evicted traders, none of them considered any of the following factors in choosing where next to relocate: proximity to customers and farmers (our source of goods), built environment factors (proximity to and conditions of road networks), and facilities in the marketplace. An evicted trader is, first, concerned about finding the next available space, every other concern is secondary at best and inconsequential at worst. For traders who have never been evicted, some of these location factors (e.g., proximity to customers and built environment factors) were considered before choosing where to (re)locate their businesses.

Some of these markets are also well-known for specific consumables. The Abinkyi satellite market, for instance, is known for its vegetables such as cabbages and lettuce. The dominance of consumables within these marketplaces could speak to the urban corner store phenomenon-the establishment of convenient retail stores in neighborhoods to provide quality and affordable food environment to low-income households (cf.

From an economic standpoint, the first three analyses prioritized location-based analysis to identify certain patterns in the emerging retailscape of Kumasi, a rapidly urbanizing metropolis in sub-Saharan Africa. The first analysis revealed how marketplaces are located near major transportation corridors, which confirms, unsurprisingly, long-held transportation-economic logic of how retail places emerge along major transportation corridors (Beauregard, 2007; Hoyt, 1960) .

This illustrates the limitation of transferring Western-centric concepts, policies, or methods to non-Western contexts (see broad discussions on this issue in McCann, 2011; McCann & Ward, 2012; Lewis, 2002) . The Christaller hypothesis, when used to explain the location of traditional satellite markets in Africa, fails to account for the fact these markets (e.g., Abinkyi) can still have high spheres of influence because they constitute vital nodes in the rural-urban food network. 7 As a result, some traders who were formally evicted to certain satellite markets have now considered such relocation as a blessing because they are now able to gain access to a broader market, and are also able to transport their produce to the markets easily. The centrality analysis, in the third step, examined the most accessible satellite market that provided higher-order goods and services within the most hygienic environment. The spatial patterns revealed by the hierarchy of these satellite markets showed that there is a concentration of satellite markets in sprawling areas. Previous studies on sprawl in Kumasi and other cities in Ghana or sub-Sahara Africa do not explicitly account for the role of traditional markets in shaping the spatial structure of cities in these African cities (see Acheampong et al., 2017; Agyemang et al., 2019; Cobbinah & Amoako, 2012; Mundia & Fig. 4 .

Murayama, 2010) . There is the need to disaggregate the \"commercial land use\" category often used in spatial models to specifically account for distinct commercial activities that drive the emerging spatial structure of cities in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries. Recent studies even reveal that the \"retail\" category can further be disaggregated into traditional marketplaces and transnational supermarket chain stores, each with distinct commercial character and impact on the morphology of cities in developing countries (see Humphrey, 2007; Reardon et al., 2003; Weatherspoon & Reardon, 2003) .

Among their conclusions, they point out that the spatial characteristics and expansion of modern shopping centers in Shanghai are influenced externally by the government's land use and commercial planning policies. In the context of this study, we also draw attention to the need to consider the landscape of spatial politics (i.e., urban planning and policies) and how it intersects with the retailscape of cities in Africa. In this article, we highlight that Kumasi's retailscape embodies an ongoing expropriation of land from traders (i.e., decongestion exercise), as the city modernizes its retailscape through the construction of a 'high modernist' market structure in the CBD and other city beautification projects. Several studies have discussed land politics and decongestion and slum clearance exercises in Ghana and its impacts on vulnerable groups (Bob--Milliar & Obeng-Odoom, 2011; Frimpong Boamah & Walker, 2017; Gillespie, 2016; Obeng-Odoom, 2014; Oteng-Ababio, 2013) . Many of these studies disproportionately focus on Accra, Ghana's capital, with less attention paid to similar urban decongestion and slum clearance practices in rapidly urbanizing cities such as Kumasi and Sekondi/Takoradi. Further, some of the earlier studies inadvertently homogenize the experiences of urban residents affected by such decongestion and slum clearance practices. This article remedies some of these gaps by using retail geography as the lens to discuss how ongoing urban planning policies (e.g., urban decongestion exercises) impact traders, which in turn shapes the retail landscape of cities. Evicted traders are forced to look for other traditional marketplaces to trade. The existence of these satellite markets provides a convenient excuse for city officials (including planning authorities) to engage in the politics of urban displacement (see also Amoako, 2016; Bob-Milliar & Obeng-Odoom, 2011; Frimpong Boamah & Amoako, 2020) . That is, when city officials argue that evicted traders are welcome to move into satellite markets, they conveniently explain away the need to properly account for these traders in their current agenda of modernizing the cityscape. As one trader earlier noted, traders do not feel secure when they move into these satellite markets because, in the end, no one knows when the next marketplace would be appropriated in service of the city's modernist urban planning agenda.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 211, "text": "Shi et al.

Thus, the article draws on the case of Kumasi to present the various understandings and connections between the spatial distribution of retail markets and the city's physical growth patterns. Despite the rapid emergence of shopping malls and supermarkets in most African cities, traditional marketplaces still present essential conceptual lenses for understanding the spatial patterns and functioning of African cities. More broadly, future studies could include additional layers to the arguments presented. For instance, social network analysis could be conducted to determine how the non-spatial networks of supply and demand are influenced by the spatial ones, especially in the production and enactment of social capital in these less-formalized market arrangements of developing economies.
