Aim We sought to estimate the mortality risk according to HTRP severity in older adults of Amerindian ancestry living in rural Ecuador. Methods This prospective study enrolled individuals aged \u2265 60 years with baseline blood pressure \u2265 120/\u2265 80 mmHg from the ongoing Atahualpa Project cohort who received retinal photographs (for HTRP grading) and a brain MRI. We ascertained all-cause mortality after a mean of 5.2 \u00b1 1.2 years of follow-up. Cox-proportional hazards models adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, neuroimaging signatures of cerebral small vessel disease, blood pressure determinations during follow-up and incident strokes, were obtained to estimate mortality risk according to HTRP severity. Results Analysis included 236 participants (mean age 69.3 \u00b1 7.3 years). HTRP Grade 2 or higher was determined in 42 (18%) individuals. Fifty participants (21%) died during the follow-up, resulting in an overall unadjusted crude mortality rate of 4.1 per 100 person-years. Mortality rate in subjects with HTRP Grade 2 or higher was 7.2 and in those with no HTRP or Grade 1 only was 3.4 per 100 person-years. An adjusted Cox-proportional hazard model showed that individuals with HTRP Grade 2 or higher maintained a greater than two-fold mortality risk (HR 2.08; 95% C.I. 1.04-4.15; p = 0.038) when compared to those with no HTRP or Grade 1 only. Conclusion Study results show that HTRP severity predicts mortality in this population of older adults.",

Asymptomatic microvascular end-organ damage often precedes the development of more severe complications of hypertension such as cerebrovascular disease, acute myocardial infarction and death [2] [3] [4] . The retina is an early end-organ damage of arterial hypertension and, as such, the presence of hypertensive retinopathy (HTRP) may predict subsequent significant morbidity and increased mortality risk among affected individuals [5] [6] [7] . The goal would be early detection and implementation of intervention strategies aimed to reduce catastrophic consequences of arterial hypertension in subjects at risk.

In brief, Atahualpa is an isolated community, and residents are homogeneous regarding race/ethnicity (Amerindian ancestry), socioeconomic status and dietary habits.

In addition, field personnel continuously visited households were participants live and reminded them and their proxies to notify us in case of a new major health problem or in the event of death. Positive non-fatal outcomes were evaluated by participants' or proxy-delivered medical history and medical records review (in case of admission to neighboring hospitals); then, a certified neurologist confirmed the diagnosis of incident stroke as previously described. Death certificates were reviewed and verbal autopsies were obtained to ascertain the date and probable cause of death. For the current study, the last censoring date was set as the 1st of June 2021. Participants who declined consent and those who emigrated were censored at the last annual survey when the individuals were interviewed, and those who died were censored at the time of death.",
