            "text": "2019-nCoV is a virulent virus belonging to the coronavirus family that caused the new pneumonia which has spread internationally very rapidly and has become pandemic. In this research paper, we set forward a statistical model called SIR-Poisson that predicts the evolution and the global spread of infectious diseases. The proposed SIR-Poisson model is able to predict the range of the infected cases in a future period. More precisely, it is used to infer the transmission of the COVID-19 in the three Maghreb Central countries (Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco). Using the SIR-Poisson model and based on daily reported disease data, since its emergence until end April 2020, we attempted to predict the future disease period over 60 days. The estimated average number of contacts by an infected individual with others was around 2 for Tunisia and 3 for Algeria and Morocco. Relying on inferred scenarios, although the pandemic situation would tend to decline, it has not ended. From this perspective, the risk of COVID-19 spreading still exists after the deconfinement act. It is necessary, therefore, to carry on the containment until the estimated infected number achieves 0.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses stand for a large family of viruses causing illnesses which range from a simple cold to more severe pathologies. Based on genetic sequence analyses, a virus was identified in December 2019 in China, as a new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1] [2] [3] . This pathogen causes a disease that is different from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2] . Several scientific studies have been conducted to explore the genetics of 2019-nCoV, its mode of transition, and the epidemiological characteristics of its transmission [4] [5] [6] . The infectious COVID-19 spreads via direct contact or droplets and results for the majority of cases in initial symptoms including fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, or fatigue. Emergency symptoms can occur. They include intestinal symptoms like diarrhea, cardiac injury, chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking, and kidney injury. The complication of the infection would lead to death [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . This pandemic first spread in China was notified to the World Health Organization (WHO) in early January by the Chinese government [2, 11, 12] . One month after the beginning of the epidemy, the virus has spread in the entire world, resulting in pandemic coronavirus. As a matter of fact, WHO has declared the COVID19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [12] . A few days after, the WHO raised the level of risk to a very high one in China, as well as globally. It has given instructions for the contagion prevention by avoiding close contact people, frequent hand washing, and the main important measures taken is the quarantine management [11, 13] . Since its appearance until April 29, 2020, worldwide the total number of confirmed cases is 3,137,720, the number of cures is 947,504, and the number of deaths is 218,456. The mortality rate is 6.96%, the cure rate is 30.20%, and the rate of people who are still sick is 62.84%. As for Tunisia, the total number of confirmed cases is 975, the number of cures is 279, and the number of deaths is 40. The mortality rate is 4.10%, the cure rate is 28.62%, and the rate of people who are still sick is 67.28%. For Algeria, the total number of confirmed cases is 3848, the number of cures is 1702, and the number of deaths is 444. The death rate is 11.54%, the cure rate is 44.23%, and the rate of people still sick is 44.23%. For Morocco, the total number of confirmed cases is 4321, the number of healings is 928, and the number of deaths is 168. The mortality rate is 3.89%, the cure rate is 21.48%, and the rate of people still sick is 74.64% [14, 15] . The spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia is rapid, ranging from 30 to 50 days after the first reported case, in Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. The pandemic state reached its peak in early April and then gradually decreased. One of the necessary tools to investigate infectious disease transmission and spread is disease mathematical modeling. In fact, various models were developed and used to understand and control infectious diseases evolution and to predict their compartmental transmission. Hoch et al., [16] developed the mathematical model Susceptible-Infectious-Removed-Susceptible (SIRS) for two divided population groups interacting with each other. Their model used five functions that provide an overview of the used mathematical forms representing different transmission processes. They simulated dynamics infection in a multi-group system and emphasized the importance of knowing the populations in contact and their related infection processes to select the most relevant between-group transmission function. Muglenga and Mubila [17] used the SIR process to model the epidemiology of malaria in a Zambian province. They analyzed the rate of infection of malaria. They predicted parameters of malaria outbreak and spread. Reduction in malaria in the studied city [17] was proposed and recommended. G\u00f6tz et al. [18] modeled the dengue fever disease induced by a viral mosquito-borne infection causing illness and death in tropical and subtropical regions. They used the classical SIR model to examine the spread of dengue in Indonesia. The IR model parameters were identified and connected to meteorological data [18] . Another study elaborated a model that considers multiple single strain conditions extending the SIR model to more dimensions and allowing the modeling of a population infected by multiple viruses. They applied their model on influenza and other similar viruses [19] . Kamina et al. [20] suggested the Gillespie algorithm based on the SIR and developed a stochastic SIR model to simulate disease evolution in the population setting. They inferred the accuracy of their model, by comparing the simulated values produced by the model to those of HIV/AIDS data from 1985 to 2018 [20] . Nishiura et al. [21] utilized compartmental modeling including differential equations and maximum likelihood estimation so as to model the transmission dynamics of Zika virus infection on Yap Island 2007 and French Polynesia 2013-2014. They compared the observed and predicted weekly numbers of new cases during the early period of the Zika virus epidemic and quantified the transmission potential infection in the South Pacific demonstrating that its transmissibility is comparable to those of chikungunya and dengue viruses [21] . Another modeling framework called Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo was used to reconstruct the annual probability of chikungunya (CHIKV) infection and population-level immunity over a period of 60 years [22] . Their model was useful to understand the long-term epidemiology of the pathogen in the Philippines. Recently, to model Covi-D19 transmission, several studies based on the SIR model were developed such as a generalized SEIR model [23, 24] , a SIR-D (dead) model [25] , and a modified SEIR model [26] .",

Simulated observations were reported on Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco (Figs. 4, 5) . In this work, the SIR-Poisson model has predicted the infected and death number of people in the future period of 60 days (May/June 2020). By varying the transmission rate or the average number R 0 of contacts by an infected individual with others, we infer a significant difference of the infected and death numbers on a daily basis if R 0 increases from 2 to 6.",

If R 0 is greater than 2 (R 0 \u226b 2), then the pandemic transmission increases rapidly and the death number increases. In this case, it is necessary to increase the containment period. Since the estimated parameter R 0 is between 2 and 3 in Maghreb Central countries in this period, the containment period will be extended ( Fig. 6a, b, c) . Note that these obtained results go in good agreement with the published results [34] . The three states of the Maghreb Central implemented strict measures that correspond, mainly, to locking of borders, imposing general confinement, placing suspected in quarantine, and conducting awareness campaigns as well as advice. Owing to all the taken provisions and people's self-commitment responsibility and discipline, the results revealed that the situation in Tunisia is better and less dangerous. This fact may be explained by the big difference in the population number. In fact, the Tunisian population is about 11.9 million inhabitants; however, Algeria and Morocco's populations are about 40 million inhabitants (43.85 and 35.9 million inhabitants, respectively). In fact, it is much easier to deal with a lower number of people. The proposed SIR-Poisson model will help the government to take an optimal deconfinement strategy (partial to total). The average number R 0 of contacts will indicate the situation during this deconfinement.",
