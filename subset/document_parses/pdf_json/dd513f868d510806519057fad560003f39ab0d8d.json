In this context, the need for speed is taken for granted, and the scientific process has adapted to accommodate this. On the surface, attempts to speed up the research enterprise appear to be a good thing. It is, however, important to consider what, if anything, might be lost when biomedical innovation is sped up. In this article we use the case of a study recently retracted from the Lancet to illustrate the potential risks and harms associated with speeding up science. We then argue that, with appropriate governance mechanisms in place (and adequately resourced), it should be quite possible to both speed up science and remain attentive to scientific quality and integrity.",

The article, which was published in May 2020, cast doubt on the effectiveness and safety of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 (Mehra et al. 2020c ). The study reported in the article drew on a registry that collected cloud-based healthcare data on 96,032 patients from 671 hospitals across six continents. The registry is owned by Surgisphere Corporation, a U.S.-based company founded by Dr. Sapan Desai (Surgisphere Corporation 2020) . The study (henceforth the Surgisphere study) concluded that there was no evidence of benefit associated with the use of hydroxychloriquine or chloroquine but that there was evidence of increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia and inhospital death. The authors called for urgent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and suggested that these drugs not be used outside this research context (Mehra et al. 2020c) .",

Following the publication of the Surgisphere study, researchers and clinicians around the globe expressed scepticism about the integrity and validity of the dataset, statistical analysis, and conclusions and on May 28, 146 wrote a letter to the Lancet calling for its retraction (Watson et al. 2020 ). An \"expression of concern\" was subsequently published in the Lancet on June 3 (The Lancet 2020), and the article was retracted by three of the authors (excluding Desai) on June 5 (Mehra, Ruschitzka, and Patel 2020) on the basis that they were unable to complete an independent audit of the data underpinning their analysis and as a result concluded that they \"can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources\" (Mehra, Ruschitzka, and Patel 2020) . A little more than an hour later, an article written by the three of the Lancet authors and two others was retracted from the New England Journal of Medicine. This article, \"Cardiovascular Disease, Drug Therapy, and Mortality in Covid-19\" (Mehra et al. 2020b ) was retracted: \"Because all the authors were not granted access to the raw data and the raw data could not be made available to a third-party auditor, we are unable to validate the primary data sources underlying our article\" (Mehra et al. 2020a) .",

A number of explanations are offered for this slowness, including resource limitations, cultural barriers, and the need for reflection and critique inherent in the scientific method itself. Research is also slowed by the governance processes that curtail certain behaviours and demand that criteria be met before research projects are funded and before resulting technologies are registered, funded, and made accessible to patients (Morris, Wooding, and Grant 2011) .",

Indeed, the larger the dataset the easier it is to draw unjustified conclusions (based on spurious correlations) about the causal nature of associations observed (Lipworth et al. 2017; Lipworth 2019) . Second, the data used in this kind of research is often incomplete or slanted towards particular patient groups, unstandardized, unstructured, and not comparable among patients or across time (Lipworth et al. 2017; Lipworth 2019) . This is particularly true when data are collected for other purposes (e.g., administration, clinical care, or even other research studies with differently defined outcome measures (Lipworth et al. 2017; Lipworth 2019) . Add to this the other limitations of data analysis using artificial intelligence, such as flaws in (often non-transparent) algorithms (Chin-Yee and Upshur 2019), and it becomes clear why even the best \"big data\" research needs to be undertaken with the utmost care.",

There is also a need for rigorous methodological review by peers. This usually occurs when applications are made for research funding or ethics approval, but it is not clear that the Surgisphere research was preceded by any kind of formal methodological review. Somewhat ironically, the Surgisphere authors appeared to be alert to the limitations of their methodology because they called for follow-up randomized trials. Setting aside whether such trials would even be ethical (a point perhaps lost in the furore), this gives the impression that even they themselves did not believe that their methods were sufficiently robust.",

If this fails, then journals can retract articles, thus removing them from the formal scientific record. Retraction is not, however, ideal because retracted articles, as was the case with both Surgisphere papers, often have considerable impacts prior to retraction and never fully \"disappear\" (Teixeira Da Silva and Bornemann-Cimenti 2017).

The reality, however, is that all those involved in biomedical research, publication, and translation (including researchers, journal editors, and clinicians) have multiple competing obligations and are embedded in a complex web of financial and nonfinancial interests, such as the desire to earn money, create product opportunities, pursue intellectual projects, and achieve professional recognition and career advancement. All of these stakeholders are also susceptible to cognitive biases that can lead them to overvalue innovative technologies (\"optimism bias\"), and to be swayed by industry marketing, and by pressure from patients, the public, and governments to address urgent unmet needs (Chan 2012; Taylor 2013) .",

To make matters worse, science tends to be sped up in precisely those circumstances in which stakes are highest and competing interests are the most powerful. As described above, when health emergencies arise, there is often \"big money\" at stake and strong political pressures (in some cases, focused on particular interventions, as evident in D o n a l d T r u m p ' s p e r s o n a l e n d o r s e m e n t o f hydroxychloroquine (Mahase 2020)). As a result, those who are the first to make, disseminate, and use new discoveries are likely to reap considerable fame and fortune. Another compounding factor is that it is easier for undeveloped methods (which, as discussed above, are often used in emergency situations) to be manipulated without detection for personal or professional gain (Lipworth 2019 ).",

While such ties to any company can be problematic for a researcher, journalists have subsequently uncovered findings suggesting that Desai and his companies have behaved with questionable integrity both in other research and in their cooperation with investigations following the Lancet publication (Davey, Kirchgaessner, and Bosely 2020) ; Mehra, Ruschitzka and Patel 2020; Ledford and Van Noorden 2020; Davey 2020) . It is important for these emerging findings to be critically interrogated and for conceptual and moral distinctions to be made between commercial interests, competing interests, misconduct, and corruption.

The scientific process can similarly lose its way: while it exists largely to \"slow down\" thinking and ensure that all ideas are thoroughly critiqued, it can also become caught up in \"checks and balances\" that are out of line with both epistemic realities and the community's appetite for risk. There will, therefore, always be ways to improve efficiencies in both science and its governance.
