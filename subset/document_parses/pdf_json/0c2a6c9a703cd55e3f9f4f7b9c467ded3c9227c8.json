Given the critical importance of blood donation and transfusion we analyzed 92 blood samples of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 stratified by symptoms. Study Design and Methods: We therefore tested blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR targeting the E gene. In addition, we tested each blood sample for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies via ELISA and performed plaque reduction neutralization tests. Results: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in the blood of mild to asymptomatic patients (57 individuals) and only detectable in individuals with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (35 individuals) (n = 6/92 [6.5%]; p = 0.023 Fisher's exact test). Interestingly, antispike IgG antibodies were not significantly higher in inten-sive care unit patients compared to mild patients, but we found that their neutralizing capacity was disproportionately increased (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our observations support the hypothesis that there are no potential hazards from blood or plasma transfusion of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals with mild flu-like symptoms and more importantly of asymptomatic individuals.",

            "text": "As of February 7th, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused nearly 106 million reported infections and over 2.3 million confirmed deaths [1] . Statistical and serological estimates suggest the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 may be between 5 and 50 times the reported case count [2] [3] [4] [5] . The failure to detect infections and in particular those of large numbers of asymptomatic or mild cases raises the question whether SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia poses a threat to individuals in need of blood donations. As particular individuals with pre-existing conditions are more likely to have a more severe course of COVID-19, knowledge about potential hazards from blood or plasma transfusion is important. SARS-CoV-2, as a novel coronavirus, infects primarily the upper and lower respiratory tract and can cause acute respiratory infections. Similar to rhinovirus or influenza, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from human to human mainly by droplets, aerosols and fomites [6] . The estimated infectiousness starts at 2-3 days before symptom onset and declines rapidly within 7 days [7] . In comparison, transmission of blood-borne viruses like HIV can result from sexual intercourse, maternal-fetal transmission, or exposure-prone procedures in health-care settings like needle stick injuries or blood transfusion [8, 9] . Untreated bloodborne virus infections can have long-lasting viremia and in case of HIV life-long contagiousness [10, 11] . So far, only a few reports from Wuhan detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the blood in individuals who were diagnosed with severe symptoms and viral pneumonia [12] [13] [14] . In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia in the blood has been evaluated in only 3 individuals from Germany with asymptomatic infection [15] . We therefore systematically evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the plasma of acutely infected patients stratified by their symptoms.",

Pharyngeal (55), nasopharyngeal (1) or anal (1) swabs as well as blood were taken at the same time and analyzed via RT-PCR (described in the following). 35 of the 92 individuals had severe symptoms, were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and needed invasive mechanical ventilation because of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ( Table 1) . Pharyngeal (34) or nasopharyngeal (1) swabs and blood were not taken at the same time. Due to treatment and the patient's clinical status blood was drawn shortly after the positive RT-PCR test. These ICU patients were still in critical condition and needed invasive mechanical ventilation.",

Interestingly, we observed similar IgG levels in all individuals regardless of the severity of their symptoms (Fig. 1 ). In addition, there was no significant difference in the IgG levels of individuals who had RNAemia in the blood compared to those without detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA (4.6 \u00b1 3.1; 4.3 \u00b1 3.3; p = 0.88, respectively). To further characterize the immune response of critically ill COVID-19 patients, we measured the neutralization capacity of their antibody responses using a plaque reduction neutralization assay. We found that individuals with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection showed very high neutralization capacities (Fig. 2 ) compared to those with mild or no symptoms [16] . Remarkably, out of 5 patients in intensive care who had detectable viral RNA in the blood, 1 individual had no detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, no neutralization capacity of the plasma, but ultimately recovered from COVID-19 (Fig. 2a, blue dot). In contrast, 2 individuals that died of CO-VID-19 had detectable viral RNA in the blood and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG with neutralizing capacity (Fig. 2a, red dot) . Interestingly, in the other fatal cases, no RNAemia was measurable in the plasma, but specific IgG was detected and neutralizing capacity was high (Fig. 2a, orange dot) . To be able to compare neutralization capacity directly between the mild and severe course of COVID-19, we tested an ELISA IgG-level-matched (online suppl. Fig. S1 ; for all online suppl. material, see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000515841) group of volunteers from an earlier study in the neutralization assay [16] . Samples with similar IgG levels as the ICU patients did not even reduce plaques by 90% at the highest serum concentration, already indicating lower neutralization capacities, so we were only able to compare the two cohorts by their NT50 values (Fig. 2b) . The neutralization capacity of the ICU patients was significantly higher than those from volunteers of the cluster outbreak cohort at similar SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG levels.",

            "text": "Whether this observed RNAemia in critical patients occurs in the absence or in spite of a SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response can for example be determined by measuring virus-specific antibody titers and their neutralization capacity. We determined in our study that in comparison of antibody levels between groups of patients with different severity of disease, the overall IgG ratios were similar in all individuals regardless of the severity of their symptoms. However, antibody levels do not indicate potential SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, which is of relevance for transfusion medicine that there is no easy surrogate for potential viremia. Although our data indicate overall similar IgG levels in severe compared to mild courses of the disease, the plasma of most severely ill patients exhibited a strongly potentiated neutralizing capacity over that observed in mild and asymptomatic cases. Yet, similar to a cluster outbreak cohort with mild or no symptoms reported on earlier, this neutralizing capacity in ICU patients could be positively correlated to IgG levels [16] . This situation is different from infections like influenza, where specific antibody titers were higher in the severely ill, but neutralization capacity did not differ significantly between severe and mild cases [19] . Furthermore, in our ICU cohort SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia in the blood could be consistently correlated neither to antibody levels nor to neutralization. Out of 5 ICU patients with RNAemia in the blood 2 deceased patients had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and exhibited strong neutralization, but 1 who was subsequently released from the hospital showed no antibodies and no neutralizing capacity. This indicates that the detection of viral RNA in the blood, IgG levels and the inpatient outcome are not associated with each other. Recent studies already reported evidence that weak seroconversion cannot predict patient outcomes, including death [20, 21] . Our data provide additional evidence that detectable viral RNA in the blood can be a factor to predict the severity of the infection rather than the patient outcomes. It is important to note that differences between individuals in other aspects of the immune response, such as production of inflammatory mediators or T cell responses, are all likely to contribute as well to patient outcomes. However, this phenomenon needs to be analyzed with larger case numbers to reveal whether the presence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be correlated to disease outcome in critical patients. This complex phenomenon therefore requires further studies involving a greater number of severe cases and additional analysis of immune markers like IL-6 to draw clearer conclusions [22] . Interesting, some of the study participants tested negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. This might be the case because samples were collected at different time points relative to infection, since depending on the severity of symptoms the participants got tested during different phases of the infection. In COVID-19, this phenomenon is enhanced by the fact that the disease causes a wide range of symptom severity, depending on age, gender, and several other factors. However, our direct comparison of neutralization capacities between mild and severe cases at comparable IgG levels shows that most critically ill COVID-19 patients have superior neutralizing antibodies, which are much more effective than those in the plasma of patients with mild courses of the disease. In spite of this highly potentiated neutralization, be that by antibody affinity maturation or clonal expansion, the presence of these antibodies did not improve the patients' clinical status, throwing into question the efficacy of convalescent serum therapy.
