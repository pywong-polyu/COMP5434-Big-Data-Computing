The majority of the dysfunctions mentioned above are often associated with endothelial deterioration, indicating that endothelium can be the target of SARS-CoV2. Our study is an exclusive observational study that quantitatively analyses COVID-19 related comorbidities. We retrieved the data of % population of COVID-19 hospitalized and deceased patients with associated comorbidities from publicly accessible portals of the five European countries. A two tailed t-test enabled us to determine the significant proportions of deaths compared to hospitalized patients with associated comorbidity. Our study revealed that deaths associated with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are highly significant (p < 0.0001) compared to hospitalized in countries like Italy, France, and Spain unlike the Netherlands. Deaths from kidney diseases (Italyp < 0.0001; Swedenp < 0.0001; Netherlandsp = 0.0001; Francep = 0.0033) and neurological ailments (Francep = 0.0001; Netherlandsp < 0.0001) are significantly higher than the total hospitalized patients affected by the particular comorbidity. We have noted that deaths due to liver diseases are least associated with COVID-19 among all comorbidities. Intriguingly, immunodeficiency shows mixed outcomes in death proportions compared to the hospital admitted individuals. Besides, the treatment regime involves drugs like losartan, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, etc. may modulate the severity of the comorbidities. These comorbidities can create chaos in the existing healthcare system and may worsen the disease outcome.",

The first outbreak of SARS-CoV2 infection is associated with the wet markets of Wuhan, China, suggesting the zoonotic origin of this virus (Mackenzie and Smith, 2020) . Although SARS viruses are known to infect animals, in certain cases, the viruses may cross species barrier and infect humans (Rabi et al., 2020) . Since the initial outbreak of COVID-19, it has become a serious threat to public health worldwide (Rabi et al., 2020) . As of 5 th July, 2020 COVID-19 has spread to more than 216 countries and territories, with 11,046,917 confirmed cases and 526,465 deaths across the globe. Nonetheless, European regions report 199,510 deaths with more than 2 million confirmed cases (WHO, 2020 COVID-19 dashboard, July 5 th , 2020).",

            "text": "COVID-19 symptoms majorly include breathing difficulty, lung infection, pneumonia, and fever (Aghagoli et al., 2020) . Emerging data depicts that COVID-19 patients have various aspects associated with hospitalization and severity. Nevertheless, the risk factors associated with SARS-CoV2 infection can be one or more such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, lung diseases, diabetes, etc. which may enhance susceptibility, complications, and mortality (Clerkin et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Richardson et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . Interestingly, an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients with comorbidities is reported . The reasons for the exclusive relation of certain comorbidities with COVID-19 may be many. It is reported that the virus attacks the smallest of the blood vessels' endothelial lining, thereby leading to circulation problems and impaired vessels functioning in various organs (Sardu et al., 2020) . This can also explain the high vulnerability of patients with comorbidities like hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Besides, renal histopathological findings of COVID-19 patients show damaged endothelium (Su et al., 2020) . Additionally, studies have established the presence of inflammatory cells and viral elements within the endothelial cells of COVID-19 patients. Bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and pulmonary oedema is observed in post-mortem samples of COVID-19 patients (Xu et al., 2020) . Therefore, the multiorgan failure observed in COVID-19 may be due to damage to the endothelium caused by either direct virus infection or immune cells recruitment to the site of infection (Zaim et al., 2020) . Fascinating studies also suggest an enhanced death rate for COVID-19 patients who possess one of the comorbidities mentioned above. A summarized report addressed that the overall case-fatality rate (2.3%) increased for COVID-19 patients with already prevailing comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory disease (6.3%) and hypertension (6.0%) (Wu and McGoogan, 2020) . A prospective cohort study related the prevalence of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients with inhospital mortality (Cheng et al., 2020) . Moreover, considering various reports on COVID-19 comorbid hospitalized cases and deaths we quantitatively analyzed the relation of hospitalized cases and death reports with one or more comorbidities in this pandemic situation.",

The hospitalized patients data was absent in this report, so it has been obtained from ECDC rapid risk assessment report 8 th update on COVID-19 where timespan for patient's data is not available.

            "text": "Our study reveals that the country-wide pattern of COVID-19 associated comorbidities in hospitalized and deceased patients remains evidently similar ( Table 1 ). Notably we found that heart diseases, including hypertension along with cardiovascular diseases, are the most frequent association with SARS-CoV2 infection in most countries (Italy, France, Spain, and Sweden) except the Netherlands. Similar reports of a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease and hypertension among hospitalized and diseased patients were demonstrated by Richardson et al. (2020) , Wu and McGoogan (2020) , and Zhou et al., 2020 in case reports from China and the United States, respectively. Importantly, SARS-CoV2 associated pneumonia in heart patients may develop hypoxemia due to hindrance in gas exchange (Li B. et al., 2020) . This may drive complications in cardiac functions and increase the risk of death. Interestingly, our study depicts a profound proportion of deaths due to heart diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. Also, our investigation reflects that the majority of the drugs used in the case of COVID-19 treatment are related to heart ailments, such as cardiovascular diseases and hypertension (Table 2) . Further, ACE2, serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), basigin (CD147), cathepsin B and L and sialic acid receptor expressed by the endothelial cells are used by SARS-CoV2 to gain entry into the host (Sardu et al., 2020) . Besides, ACEi/ARBs exert protective effects on patients with hypertension and heart disorders; however, the effect diminishes on the binding of virus spike protein to ACE2 (Sardu et al., 2020) . Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, widely used drugs for SARS-CoV2 infection, were also reported to induce arrhythmias along with atrial and ventricular antiarrhythmic effects (Teixeira et al., 2002; Malviya, 2020) . Intriguingly reports from government medicine agencies of most of the countries like Italy, Spain, and France (Italian Medicines Agency, 2020; National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products, 2020; Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products, 2020) have earlier advised the use of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19. Further, the virus is known to initiate diabetes by intensifying the condition of insulin resistance or by targeting the pancreatic islets. ACE2 can serve as a therapeutic target and may aid in microcirculation in the islets (Sardu et al., 2020) . Several studies have already demonstrated that diabetic patients have increased susceptibility to COVID-19 (Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020) . Nevertheless, our study shows that the population of deceased diabetic patients to the total hospitalized patients with diabetes is higher in Italy and Spain, unlike the Netherlands and Sweden.",

A study showed that more than 20% of critically ill COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with acute kidney injury (Richardson et al., 2020) . Our study clearly demonstrates a significant population of the deceased with kidney disorders compared to hospitalized patients for all the countries under consideration. Besides, COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome may develop acute kidney injury as an outcome of elevated vascular permeability, intrarenal inflammation, volume depletion, and cardiomyopathy (Ronco and Reis, 2020) . The treatment for COVID-19 includes Remdesivir and Losartan which have possible renal side-effects (Grein et al., 2020) . Prior knowledge of an individual's medical history can facilitate better treatment to COVID-19 patients rather than adding up to the disease misery.",

Patients with immunodeficiency include individuals with compromised immune systems like AIDS or undergoing any immunosuppressive therapy. Notably, the antiviral therapies given to AIDS patients may slightly benefit in COVID-19 recovery as well (H\u00e4rter et al., 2020) . Further, since the immune system is suppressed, these patients are highly susceptible to opportunistic pathogens, including SARS-CoV2. Therefore, we obtained variations in death reports compared to hospitalized patients from different countries. Briefly, severe COVID-19 patients report acute cerebrovascular disease, conscious disturbance, and muscle injury. Plausibly SARS-CoV2 may invade the cerebrovascular and nervous system using ACE2 receptors, or the patients with a priori abnormal neurological conditions might be prone to SARS-CoV2 (Liguori et al., 2020) . COVID-19 patients with neurological conditions may result in poor prognosis and might die due to unrevealed complications. A case study by Mao et al. (2020) demonstrated that neural manifestations were significantly more common in severe infections compared with non-severe infections. Hence, these conditions should be monitored vigilantly. Losartan and Tocilizumab recommended for COVID-19 are previously reported to have adverse neurological effects. Thus a proper combination of medication may be adopted.",

How fast we are able to identify the virus-induced disorder in a person with certain comorbidity is equally important. It will enable to render the person with a suitable treatment plan within a safer timeframe. Therefore, the reaction time to the pandemic is crucial. In addition, the outcomes of COVID-19 may be independent of the comorbidities; we have efficiently corroborated available data based on hospitalized and deceased COVID-19 patients with associated comorbidities. Although the information provided by all the countries is not similarly categorized. For example, in terms of hospitalized cases, the patients in ICU are included or excluded is not specified in the report from Netherlands. Information regarding comorbidity patients of several categories is not presented in the case of Spain. Many of the other comorbidities like smoking, obesity, cancer, etc. couldn't be considered in the study due to lack of information in most reports. Furthermore, the information about hospitalization average length was not available in the reports from where the data is collected because the data was regarding on-going cases and not with respect to any completed trials or reports. Nonetheless, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were the most prominent of all in Italy, France, and Spain. However, the pattern of the deceased population due to COVID-19 associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic lung ailments for the Netherlands, is contrary to other countries. The possible higher association of these diseases with COVID-19 might be due to altered physiological conditions of an individual or plausibly due to side effects of the drugs used in the country as a prescription to treat COVID-19. This clearly shows that prior knowledge of an individual's health is critical to avoid fatal repercussions of COVID-19 treatment.",
