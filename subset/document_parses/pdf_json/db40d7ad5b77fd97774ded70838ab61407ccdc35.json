As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 includes fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, muscle or body aches, fatigue, headache, sore throat, a new loss of taste or smell, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea [3] . Double B.1.617 (E484K and L452R) and triple mutant (V382L) strains of single-stranded RNA virus have been reported from twenty-one nations around the globe, and these patients have presented with increased severity of symptoms as compared to previous strains and have been classified as variants of concern by the World Health Organization [4] .",

Likewise, sarilumab, another IL-6 antibody, is also under trials for the treatment of COVID- 19. ere was improvement in the respiratory function as measured by PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio with the use of sarilumab [10, 11] . But, the improvement in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was not Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases statistically significant with the comparison group. Tocilizumab has already been established as an effective drug in improving oxygen transfer from lungs to blood [15] . Mortality assessment on a 6-or 7-point ordinal scale determined that the number of deaths was decreased but it was not statistically significant among the sarilumab group and comparison group [13, 14] . e probable reason for these could be concomitant the use of other medications such as dexamethasone, lopinavir, and heparin. Similar to sarilumab, lopinavir also reported similar mortality rates among lopinavir and standard care groups [16] . Furthermore, dexamethasone reduced the death by one-third and one-fifth among COVID-19 patients who were on mechanical ventilation and without invasive mechanical ventilation, respectively, in a RECOVERY trial [17] . But, the same trial did not report a reduction in mortality for the patients who were not on respiratory support [17] . Early administration of cytokine modulation therapy Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases (Tocilizumab), before the onset of symptoms, deteriorates the onset of cytokine storm. Hence, the timing of IL-6 therapy may also have affected the mortality. Immunomodulation is thought to be beneficial in serious cases of COVID-19. When sarilumab was given in patients with severe COVID-19 in the ICU, it was found to have significant improvement in health condition, and they were transferred to medical wards [13] . Suppression of IL-6 alone may not be sufficient to explain the inflammatory phase of this disease because of the involvement of other inflammatory cytokines and chemokine. Tocilizumab found no significant improvement in reducing disease severity and time to intubation or death in a randomized controlled trial [18] . Similar findings were observed in a trial of dexamethasone versus usual care in patients with COVID-19; this trial suggested survival benefits that were associated with the intensity of respiratory support [17] . Sarilumab may reduce the number of days of hospitalization. Less number of patients went on mechanical ventilation or death in EMPACTA, randomized placebo-controlled study for tocilizumab [19] . Sarilumab is a safe drug with less treatment-emergent adverse effects. Most of the studies did not report the adverse effects, and among the studies that reported adverse effects, treatment-emergent adverse events were not available. Tocilizumab, another IL-6 antibody, was found to be safe, but it showed an increase in the incidence of adverse infectious events such as bacterial and fungal infections with no better outcomes with 400 mg dose compared with patients treated with a single dose of tocilizumab 400 mg [20] . e included studies were conducted for a shorter duration, and hence, long-term adverse events were not available.",

Concomitant use of other therapies along with sarilumab also had interfered with the outcomes. Efficacy endpoints that were used to assess may be insensitive for a wide range of COVID-19 because its symptom ranges from asymptomatic to respiratory failure. Also, the functional scale to assess mortality was different across different studies. e sample sizes of the included studies were small, and the duration of the study was also short. Finally, most of the studies were open label, were not randomized, and were conducted in a singlecenter setting.",
