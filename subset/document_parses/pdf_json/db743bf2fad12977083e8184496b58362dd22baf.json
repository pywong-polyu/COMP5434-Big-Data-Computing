            "text": "Police forces are responsible to investigate cybercrimes and to protect their own assets from cybersecurity attacks. The majority of police forces find it difficult to fulfil their responsibilities in this regard in the face of constrained funding, a lack of awareness and training amongst law enforcement staff, the growing number of cybercrime incidences, and outdated or insufficient technology and infrastructure. Even if police forces are able to install technical controls to counter cyber threats, their staff members' cyber behaviour may be a weak link in the cybersecurity chain and will probably not have sufficient training. The cultivation of a cybersecurity culture has been shown to be the best approach to address human behaviour in the cyber domain. There are several frameworks and other resources available for an organisation to cultivate a cybersecurity culture but the organisational culture in law enforcement agencies is different than that in other organisations. The cyber behaviour, cybercrime investigation skills, training and education of police force members require customised strategies and research. African police forces find it particularly difficult to deal with these challenges due to a lack of funding and a shortage of cybersecurity capability and capacity. This paper presents guidelines for African police forces to formulate strategies and plans to train and educate their members and to foster an organisational cybersecurity and cybercrime combatting culture.",

CSC does not only include cybersecurity awareness and information security frameworks, but is also concerned with making cybersecurity an integral part of an employee's job, habits and conduct. Gcaza, von Solms and Jansen van Vuuren [5] defined CSC as the aim to \"instill a certain way to 'naturally behave' in daily life, a way that subscribes to certain [cybersecurity] assumptions\". In addition, a CSC also encapsulates socio-cultural measures that includes technical security methods, to ensure that cyber actions become a natural aspect of the daily activity [6] .",

It takes time to cultivate a cybersecurity culture but it is crucial to influence and alter the behaviour of users over time to use technology securely [8, 9] . This paper applies existing research results on the cultivation of an organisational cybersecurity culture and results on cybersecurity and fighting cybercrime in police forces to propose a framework aimed at cultivating an African Police Cybersecurity and Cybercrime combatting culture (CCCC), which includes the training and educating of police force members to support cybercrime investigations. Section 2 gives an overview of literature on the cultivation of such an organizational culture. Section 3 discusses the structural requirements in a police force for investigating cybercrime, while Sect. 4 contains guidelines on how to capacitate those structures. In Sect. 5, the previous sections are combined to produce a step-by-step guide for the cultivation of an appropriate cybersecurity culture in a police force.",

More complex measurements will also be needed because culture consist of more than only behaviours; it also includes values, attitudes and perceptions about cybersecurity. Mlamedal and Roislien [12] motivate the identification of a robust set of indicators that enable the creation of an appropriate baseline for the measurement of a CCCC. Accountability by members are also important [29] . Threat exchange of cybersecurity information must be distributed on a regular basis to police officers. The identification of target groups is complex due to each division having its own organisational culture. A CCCC will not be successful if it is enforced on a group; it must be cultivated over time, with the required adaptations. Examples of different target groups are the Senior Management: Commissioned Officers, Commissioning Officers, Non-Commissioning officers, IT providers and the Cybercrime units.",

Different platforms such as videos, instructor-led training, quizzes, games, email, internal social media etc. can be used. In addition, cybersecurity drills can be arranged for units [21] . Communication is important to emphasise the necessity of the exercises and to ensure continued participation. Exercises must also include the identification of cybercrimes and the assessment of correct measures taken in the evaluation of a cybercrime scene. A set of metrics must be established to measure success. There also must be customised exercises for senior commissioning officers focused on policies. These activities must include activities geared for staff with knowledge levels ranging from no technical knowledge to a high level of IT knowledge and competence. A Best Practice manual must accompany all training material to encourage the adoption of practices aimed at promoting secure online behaviour.",

Although there are several frameworks and other resources available for an organisation to cultivate a cybersecurity culture, law enforcement agencies face a different environment. This paper considers frameworks and resources on the cultivation of organisational cybersecurity culture to present a customized framework for a police force. In addition, requirements to create a cybercrime combatting culture in a police force environment are specified. The paper thus presents comprehensive guidelines in this regard that can be implemented and applied by police forces in Africa.",
