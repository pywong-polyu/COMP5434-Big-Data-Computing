Over the past decades, it has become a simple and versatile method for nanofiber production. Hence, it has been explored in many different applications. Commonly used electrospinning assembles fibers from polymer solutions in various solvents, known as solution electrospinning, while melt and near-field electrospinning techniques enhance the versatility of electrospinning. Adaption of additive manufacturing strategy to electrospinning permits precise fiber deposition and predefining pattern construction. This manuscript critically presents the potential of electrospun nanofibers in healthcare applications. Research community drew impetus from the similarity of electrospun nanofibers to the morphology and mechanical properties of fibrous extracellular matrices (ECM) of natural human tissues. Electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds act as ECM analogs for specific tissue cells, stem cells, and tumor cells to realize tissue regeneration, stem cell differentiation, and in vitro tumor model construction. The large surface-to-volume ratio of electrospun nanofibers offers a considerable number of bioactive agents binding sites, which makes it a promising candidate for a number of biomedical applications. The applications of electrospinning in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, controlled drug delivery, biosensors, and cancer diagnosis are elaborated. Electrospun nanofiber incorporations in medical device coating, in vitro 3D cancer model, and filtration membrane are also discussed.",

In simple terms, the electrospinning process relies on an electrohydrodynamic principle that a highly electrified polymer solution or melt is forced to stretch and elongate into fibers [ Fig. 1(a) ].

            "text": "In solution electrospinning where a polymer solution is elongated and thinned by whipping effect, quick evaporation of solvents results in solidification of the polymer jet and nanofiber deposition, whereas in melt electrospinning [ Fig. 1(c) ], polymers remain in a molten state that exhibit lower electrical conductivity, higher viscosity, and lower density of surface charge than polymer solutions. The solidification of molten jets relies on the heat transfer between the jet and surrounding medium. Such rapid solidification further suppresses the whipping effect and requires stronger electrostatic repulsion to overcome the viscoelastic force. 2 Therefore, the electrostatic force mainly contributes to thinning of the molten jet, which is not as sufficient as solution electrospinning with whipping effect and solvent evaporation. The diameter of melt electrospun fibers is typically on the micrometer scale, while the jet travels in a straight path before deposition and solidification, allowing better fiber placement control. Since a heating device is included in the melt electrospinning setup, thermoset polymers, thermally unstable polymers, and some bioactive molecules cannot be incorporated. Conventional electrospinning is usually conducted in the far-field model where the distance between the spinneret and collector ranges from 5 to 15 cm with a high applied voltage (10-20 kV). 2 By reducing that distance to 500 lm-1 cm, 2,3 near-field electrospinning can be obtained [ Fig. 1(d) ]. The electric field will be highly concentrated within such short distance that permits substantially reduced applied voltage to several hundred volts (normally 0.6-3 kV). 3 The whipping instability is dampened in near-field electrospinning, and the jet is deposited on the collector within straight segments. Similarly, like melt electrospinning, near-field electrospinning allows precisely spatial control of fiber deposition together with fiber diameters on the micrometer scale. Yet with lower applied voltage, near-field electrospinning is more suitable than melt electrospinning for bioactive molecules accommodation.",

            "text": "Mechanical properties incompliance between electrospun scaffolds and native bones is a common problem. Polymers are the most commonly electrospun materials, yet exhibit lower modulus than native hard tissue in general. 9 The ideal scaffold should offer sufficient mechanical support during bone regeneration and biochemical guidance to induce osteogenesis for healing acceleration. A sponge-like 3D nanofibrous silk fibroin/poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffold was mineralized and immobilized with BMP-2 peptide. 25 The mineralization improved the compressive modulus of scaffolds significantly (468.5 6 48.7 kPa vs 109.3 6 21.8 kPa). However, such modulus is much lower than that of native cancellous bones of 0.4 GPa. 9 The authors suggested that those sponge-like scaffolds were potential to calvarial defects. Since the major contents in the bone are type I collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, for bone regeneration, biocompatible and biodegradable polymeric scaffolds are always reinforced with inorganic substance such as hydroxyapatite, bioactive glass, and silica. An electrospun scaffold out of silk fibroin/PVA/58S bioglass was developed for bone regeneration. 35 The addition of (a) Tissue engineering is a highly multidisciplinary field that recruits experts from engineering, materials science, life science, and clinical medicine. (b) In tissue engineering, biocompatible scaffolds act as a temporary template for tissue-specific cell growth and proliferation, and are occasionally incorporated with biomolecules for enhanced cell regulation and tissue regeneration. Upon implantation of the engineered tissue, scaffolds will gradually degrade leaving regenerated tissues or organs with restored functionality. bioactive glass significantly improved the mechanical properties of scaffolds with a raised Young's modulus from 293 6 64 MPa to 655 6 151 MPa. Considering relatively high modulus of ceramics and metals, incorporation of such stiffer materials into a polymeric matrix or developing polymer-free ceramic scaffolds for hard tissue regeneration is expected.",

Spatially organized nanofiber structure, material composition with graded distribution, and bioactive agents can attribute to a specialized scaffold for regeneration of such interfaces. A nanofibrous mat with \"aligned-to-random\" nanofibers was developed to mimic the graded structure in the tendon-to-bone interface. 38 The aligned nanofibers represented highly aligned collagen fibers and tendon, while the random portion mimicked the less ordered collagen fibers in bones. A dual-layer organic/inorganic nanofibrous scaffold was fabricated to recapitulate the gradient mineral content within the tendon-to-bone interface. 39 The PLLA/nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) nanofibrous mat was synthesized via electrospinning of nHA on the top of the PLLA electrospun mat, which resembled the mineralized and non-mineralized fibrocartilage in the interface, respectively. For cartilage-to-bone interface regeneration, nanofibrous scaffolds are always combined with hydrogels since cartilage is a resilient tissue. Mohan et al. designed a 3D hybrid scaffold that assembled PCL nanofibers with gradients of chondroitin sulfate and bioactive glass into hydrogel. 40 The chondroitin sulfate addition promoted glycosaminoglycan-enriched ECM secretion by chondrocytes mimicking the hyaline cartilage, whereas the bioactive glass content enhanced mineralized ECM formation. Muscle-to-tendon interface and interface at the neuromuscular junction are two typical soft-to-soft tissue interfaces. The myotendinous junction connects dense collagen fibers in tendon to softer muscle fibers. The main difficulty in regeneration of myotendinous junction is a comparable stiffness transition to native junctions. For example, Ladd et al. developed PCL/poly (lactic acid) (PLA) nanofibrous scaffolds which followed the mechanical trend of native myotendinous junctions. 41 However, the ratio of tendon to muscle stiffness was 6, which is far from the natural ratio in the range of 179-37 000. 42 Studies on neuromuscular junction remodeling are quite limited. The natural neuromuscular junction is essential to support native functionality of motor neurons and skeletal muscles. The scaffolds should recapitulate the innervation in living skeletal muscles and restore the response of muscles to neurotransmitters. 42 Culturing stem cells on the scaffolds and guiding them into desired differentiation such as tenogenic, myofibroblastic, and neural differentiation may help with the interface reconstruction.",

Bone marrow derived MSCs can differentiate into Schwann cells on uniaxially oriented PCL nanofibers. 27 Radially aligned nanofibers are attractive for spinal cord injury repair, which recruits cells from the central canal region to lesion site. Li et al. developed radially aligned electrospun collagen/ PCL mats with a circular gradient of biomolecules incorporation. 47 Such scaffolds directed and promoted neural stem cells migrated from the periphery to center along nanofibers. However, planar scaffolds are mainly used in in vitro neural tissue regeneration studies. A nerve guidance conduit (NGC) with a complex, multitubular structure is widely used in in vivo studies. Currently, including all the topographic and biochemical characteristics of the native nerve tissue in the NGC design remains challenging. The size of intraluminal microchannels in NGC can be controlled via sacrificial templates such as sucrose fibers. 48 With a controllable channel, intraluminal fillers can be introduced to obtain additional topographical cues. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) unidirectionally aligned nanofibers with laminin coating have been used as fillers within NGC, which provides topographic and biological guidance to nerve tissue regeneration simultaneously. 49 Piezoelectric polymers and conductive polymers can provide electrical stimulation to cells. A conductive polypyrrole (PPy)/silk fibroin NGC was fabricated by 3D printing and electrospinning. 50 Unidirectional PPy/silk fibroin fibers were 3D printed and incorporated as intraluminal fillers. A dual-layer of electrospun aligned and random silk fibroin nanofibers assembled the shell of NGC. The topographic and electrical cues of such NGCs allowed proliferation of Schwann cells and in vivo axonal regeneration. Further study can focus on integrating biological, topographic, and electrochemical cues in nanofibers for better neural regeneration due to the synergistic effect of those guidance.",

Unlike the grafts for large-diameter arteries, the major concern for small-diameter vascular grafts is maintaining the lumen patency. 51 Graft occlusion typically occurs in small-size blood vessels due to acute thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia, which significantly impairs vascular grafts function. Construction of a non-thrombogenic scaffold surface and achieving rapid endothelization within the electrospun scaffolds are both critical in avoiding thrombosis. There is limited research investigating the scaffold surface configuration for anti-thrombosis. Current approaches are incorporation of biomolecules into nanofibers such as heparin for anticoagulation and accelerating endothelization within the grafts. Surface modified with biomolecules (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factors) through covalent bonding or the core-sheath structure to promote endothelial cells recruitment 52 and local delivery of miRNA to modulate the endothelial cell phenotype have been both investigated. 53 Other approaches rely on direct pre-seeding of endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells on electrospun grafts. 54 Maintaining a contractile phenotype of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is critical in minimizing intimal hyperplasia. Highly aligned PCL/hyaluronan nanofibers promoted higher contractile gene expression in SMCs. 55 It is worth to note that intimal hyperplasia occurs in all vascular grafts with different degrees due to blood flow profiles, which is independent of scaffold materials, 51 while compliance mismatch between the scaffolds and native vessels partially results in intimal hyperplasia. Developing a vascular graft to obtain mechanical properties consistent with native vessels is of great importance.",

Abnormal fibroblast proliferation and subsequent collagen deposition lead to scar formation. Several cell signaling molecules including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1), and ginsenoside-Rg3 have been studied to address it. Ginsenoside-Rg3 and bFGF can promote the normal function of fibroblast; thus, they have been introduced to PLGA nanofibers by blending electrospinning and surface immobilization, 58 whereas TGF-b1 signaling would promote fibroblast abnormal proliferation. TGF-b1 inhibitors were loaded in PCL/gelatin nanofibers via blend electrospinning for hypertrophic scarring inhibition. 59 To prevent scar formation, the effect of nanofibers on the cellular signaling mechanisms and biochemical pathways should be elucidated. Whether the nanofiber features such as fiber diameter and fiber alignment would influence the scar inhibition remains to be determined.",

Typical drug loading strategies include post-electrospinning modification, blend electrospinning, coaxial electrospinning, and nanoparticles encapsulation (Fig. 5) . Different drug loading strategies lead to different interactions between drugs and nanofibers, which results in different drug releasing kinetics. Initial burst release typically occurs in drug loading avenues. Practically, initial release of specific drugs in clinic can benefit the anti-inflammatory effect in the early stage. It would be more favorable to secure controlled and sustained drug release in complex scenarios. The localized and target-specific delivery of anti-cancer drugs can further eliminate potential damage of chemotherapy to surrounding tissue.

One strategy is surface immobilization of drugs to nanofibers and by controlling the degradation rate of a specific conjugation linker to achieve controlled drugs release. For instance, it is reported that there is an inverse correlation between matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP) levels and diabetic ulcer wound healing rate. 62 A complex of linear PEI and DNA was conjugated to a PCL/polyethylene glycol (PEG) scaffold via an MMP cleavable peptide linker for diabetic ulcer healing. 63 Compared to direct immobilization of DNA to scaffolds, the modified conjugating system showed an MMP dependent release profile.",

            "text": "When processing drugs/polymer blends through electrospinning, preserving the bioactivity of drugs is another challenge. Drugs would be in direct contact with organic solvents, high electric charge, and even mechanical stress during electrospinning. Therefore, the bioactivity of drugs, some labile molecules in particular, will be hindered. To stabilize the drugs, binding them to other molecules may be an option. 61 For example, emulsion electrospinning of BMP-2 and PLGA resulted in denaturation of BMP-2. 67 When included hydroxyapatite into the formulation, the bioactivity of BMP-2 was retained. Similarly, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a stabilizer for electrospinning of NGFs and poly (caprolactone-co-ethylethylene phosphate) led to preserved bioactivity to some extent. 68 Blending drugs with polymers (e.g., silk fibroin) that can be electrospun under mild processing conditions can be another approach. Near-field electrospinning exhibits concentrated electric field; thus, it allows for a substantially reduced applied voltage. It can be further investigated for drug delivery since it can minimize the electrically charged effect on bioactivity. Coaxial electrospinning of drugs and polymers provides a more sustained drug release. Normally, drugs are embedded in the core and released through either pores in the sheath or shell polymer degradation. Due to the barrier effect of the sheath structure, an initial burst release can be avoided. The shell polymer solution guarantees the successful fiber formation in coaxial electrospinning, and the electric charge is predominantly found on the sheath. 61 Therefore, core-sheath nanofibers are preferred for delivery of labile molecules such as enzymes and growth factors even cells can be included. 69 One current research focus is on the construction of a \"smart\" drug delivery system for controlled release in terms of target-specific and triggerable. Incorporating drug loaded nanoparticles and microspheres into electrospun nanofibers is a common strategy for better control of drug release. The host fiber characteristics as well as the particle properties can be both tailored for specific requirements. The drug delivery system containing drugs encapsulated particles and electrospun nanofibers is highly desired in cancer therapeutics. Localized and controlled chemotherapy can be achieved with higher therapeutic efficiency but lower drugs dosage; hence, there is lower toxicity to the surrounding tissue. A pH-sensitive anti-tumor drug delivery system was constructed by encapsulating CaCO 3 -capped mesoporous SiO 2 nanoparticles in PLLA electrospun fibers. 70 Doxorubicin (DOX), an anti-tumor drug, was loaded into nanoparticles. The reaction between CaCO 3 and the acidic environment on the tumor site would stimulate the release of DOX, while in the normal tissue with the physiological pH, only a minor release of such anti-tumor drug was detected. That pH-responsive anti-cancer efficacy can last over 40 days. Trametinib loaded hollow copper silicate was introduced to the PCL/poly (D, Llactic acid) (PDLLA) electrospun matrix for chemo-photothermal therapy of melanoma. 71 This anti-tumor drug delivery system was near-infrared irradiation (NIR)-sensitive. Releasing of multiple drugs attributes to a synergistic therapy that exhibits better antitumor efficacy. For example, co-delivery of paclitaxel and RNA interference (RNAi) to brain tumor simultaneously inhibited tumor angiogenesis and suppressed tumor cells proliferation. 72 The RNAi and drugs were loaded in PEI nanoparticles and then encapsulated into PLGA electrospun microfibers. Surface immobilized of nanofibers or particles with functional groups allow for higher tumor cells affinity; hence, there is better target efficiency. In one demonstration, folate decorated PCL/ PEG micelles were loaded with DOX and processed through coaxial electrospinning with PVA aqueous solution. 73 DOX contained micelles resided in the core, while PVA nanofiber composed the outer sheath. Folate can bind to folate receptors that usually overexpressed on a number of solid tumors, which constructs an active-targeting drug delivery system. 74 ",

Characteristics of each approach are presented. the performance of a biosensor including sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and response time. High sensitivity is highly important in successful detection of biological substances at relatively low concentrations, to which electrospun nanofibers could contribute. The large surface-to-volume ratio of nanofibers allows more binding sites for analytes recognition; thus, it ensures an optimal sensitivity of electrospun nanofibers incorporated biosensors. Electrospun nanofibers are typically integrated into biosensors through two avenues. 76 Electrospun functional polymers such as PANi can be directly used as the inducing element in biosensors.

Electrospinning allows the manipulation of material properties down to the nanoscale, which is the most consistent scale to native ECM. Instead of the traditional 2D scaffolds used in those applications, 3D scaffolds are more favored for more efficient resemblance to native ECM. A complete replication of cell-matrix interactions can enhance the regeneration efficiency. Therefore, the influence of nanofibers on cellular signaling mechanisms and biochemical pathways is encouraged to further investigate for a better understanding of cell-nanofiber interactions. Drugs can be encapsulated into nanofibers through post-electrospinning modifications, blend electrospinning as well as coaxial electrospinning, and nanoparticles incorporation. Different drug loading methods result in different drug releasing profiles. Drug releasing from nanofibers following a predictable spatiotemporal profile is more expected in the future, whereas there are a few studies of pharmacokinetics of drug-loaded electrospun nanofibers, which would limit the practical application. Overall, the future opportunities would lie in multifunctional electrospun products development based on combination of various applications. For example, drug releasing nanofibrous scaffolds can simultaneously promote tissue regeneration and achieve therapeutic function or anti-tumor drug embedded biosensors for early cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy.
