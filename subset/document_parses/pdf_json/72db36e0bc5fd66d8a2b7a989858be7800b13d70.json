LPC DealScan, the other main data source on the syndicated loan market, reports information on the identity of loans' owners, but only at the time of the loan origination and, even then, the information it reports on investors' loan shares is very sparse. 4 The Shared National Credit (SNC) program allows us to overcome these limitations. The program, which was established in 1977, covers syndicated loans of $20 million or more that are held by three or more supervised institutions. The SNC program is useful to investigate issues related to loans' ownership because it collects information, both at the time of the loan origination and at the end of each calendar year, on the identity of all loan investors and on their loan shares. We draw on the SNC data and the growing presence of nonbank institutions among loan investors to investigate to what extent diversity among investor types plays a role on the loan liquidity in the secondary market.",

We consider two proxies for investor diversity -the number of different types of loan investors and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index of the investor-types' loan shares. These two measures capture different but related aspects of investor diversity. They are both driven by differences in investors' specialization, with the second one accounting for the loan shares that each type of investors owns. We measure loan liquidity by its bid-ask spread, a widely used measure of liquidity in financial markets. 5 Our results reveal that investor diversity is an important determinant of loan bid-ask spreads. Specifically, our baseline loan bid-ask spread regressions show that more diverse syndicates, as measured by the number of investor-types or the concentration of loan shares by investor-type, hold loans that have lower quoted bid-ask spreads in the secondary market. A one-standard deviation increase in the number of investor types is associated with a decrease of 12 bps in the loan bid-ask spread (representing a 8.7% decrease in the sample mean bid-ask spread). A one-standard deviation decrease in the concentration of investor types' loan shares is associated with a decrease of 4 bps in the loan bid-ask spread (representing a 2.9% decrease in the sample mean bid-ask spread). These results support the insight that information diversity among investors, as driven by (or at least partially driven by) their distinct business models, is beneficial to loan liquidity.",

Indeed, taking a closer look at borrowers' information opacity, identified based on whether the borrower has a credit rating or a bond that trades in the secondary market, we find that investors' diversity brings a higher liquidity benefit for loans of more informationaly opaque borrowers. In addition, we conduct a series of robustness tests to address the endogeneity concerns that our baseline results could be driven by investors' borrowers/loan selections.

The first measure is the number of different types of investors, T Y P ES, such as banks, CLOs, finance companies, loan mutual funds, hedge funds and pension funds, brokers, and insurance companies. The second measure is the Herfindahl-Hirschman index of the sum of the squared loan shares that each lender type owns, H H I . While the first measure focuses on the types of investors without accounting for their loan investments, the second measure gauges the degree of concentration of investor-type shares. If investor diversity matters, then we should find that loans held by more investor types and loans held by less concentrated syndicates in terms of investor-type shares to have a lower average bid-ask spread in the secondary market.",

We start by discussing our syndicate-specific controls, SY NDI CAT E. We control for the share of the loan the arranger retains, ARRANGERSH, for two reasons. First, the size of arranger's exposure to the loan will likely influence its incentives to gather borrowerspecific information, and available theories suggest that the presence of informed investors can affect securities' liquidity. Copeland and Galai (1983) and Glosten and Milgrom (1985) , for example, show that the presence of information-motivated traders imposes adverse selection costs on dealers and other non-information motivated traders, driving up securities' bid-ask spreads and lowering their liquidity. Admati and Pfleiderer (1988) and Holden and Subrahmanyam (1992) , in contrast, show that when multiple informed investors compete with each other, and especially when there is a large uninformed investor base, the speed of the price discovery increases, lowering securities' bid-ask spreads and increasing their liquidity. Second, sometimes the arranger of the loan also acts as a dealer for the loan. 7 Theories of the bid-ask spread posit that the quoted spread accounts for three forms of transaction costs faced by dealers (order processing costs, inventory costs, and information costs) which vary inversely with the liquidity of security. It is believed that the size of the order flow and frequent trading activities reduce the fixed costs of trading (Demsetz 1968) . Similarly, the ease with which a dealer can either acquire a security or dispose of it will lower its inventory costs. See Tinic (1972) , Stoll (1978 and 1989) , Copeland and Galai (1983) , Glosten and Milgrom (1985) , Kyle (1985) and Easley and O'Hara (1987) for theories of bid-ask spreads. Therefore, the arranger will need to retain a portion of the loan to act as market maker in which case it will also affect loan liquidity in the secondary market.",

Term loans B and C include second-lien loans and covenant-lite loans. They came into broad usage during the mid-1990s as nonbank institutional loan investor base grew. They usually involve a large bullet payment in the last year, allowing borrowers to defer repayment of a large portion of the loan. In the robustness tests, we further control for the lagged average price of the loan as quoted by dealers, P RI CE, and the volatility of the loan price, P RI CEV OL.

In contrast, the average bid-ask spread for loans in the high investor type group is 1.13%, significantly lower than that for loans in the low investor type group (with a t statistic of -13.46). 10 In line with this insight, we see that the former loans receive fewer quotes from dealers (i.e., an average of 1.91 per day vs. an average of 3.96 per day for loans in the high investor type Table 1 , we get a mixed picture.

However, this relationship seems to be driven by those instances in which the lead arranger retains a share of the loan in order to act as a dealer for the loan. 11 Turning our attention to the remaining controls, we see that loans that have a larger number of the top dealers among their investors, DEALERS, have lower bid-ask spreads. Larger loans, LAMOU N T , and loans with more years to maturity, MAT LEF T , tend to have a lower average bid-ask spread. Safer loans also have on average lower bidask spreads.

We assume that borrowers with a credit rating, RAT I NG, are less informationaly opaque because there is more information available about them.

The estimated coefficient on RAT I NG is negative, though statistically significant only in model 1, while that on BOND, is negative and statistically significant in all models. Second, consistent with our priors, we find strong evidence that investor diversity is more important for the liquidity of loans of more informationaly opaque borrowers. This holds true for both proxies of diversity when we use RAT I ND to distinguish borrowers according to their level of informational opacity. Specifically, the coefficient estimate on the interaction term between RAT I NG and T Y P ES is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level while that on the interaction between RAT I NG and H H I is negative and statistically significant at the 5% level.

Syndicates with a larger number of investor types, as well as less concentrated syndicates in terms of investortypes' loan shares are both associated with more liquid loans. Further, consistent with our expectations, these effects are more pronounced for more informationaly opaque borrowers.

To that end, we reestimate our model of loan bid-ask spreads on the subset of term loans A. We choose to conduct the tests on term loans A primarily because they account for about half of our sample. In addition, focusing on term loans B (and higher), to some extent, biases against diversity because banks, insurance companies and finance companies are less likely to invest in these loans. 13 The results of this exercise are reported in columns (1) and (2) of Table 4 . A quick comparison of these results with our baseline results derived on the entire sample (Table 2) shows that restricting the sample to term loans A has only marginal effects on the magnitude and the statistical significance of our proxies for investor diversity: T Y P ES and H H I . The estimated coefficient on T Y P ES remains negative and statistically significant at the 1% level with a marginally increased magnitude (i.e., -0.039 for term loans A compared with -0.037 for the full sample). Similarly, the estimated coefficient on H H I remains positive and statistically significant at the 5% level with a larger magnitude (i.e., 0.420 for term loans A compared with 0.252 for the full sample). 12 We also try to address the concern of reverse causality by putting our measures of investor diversity on the left hand side and the lagged loan bid-ask spreads on the right hand side with the same set of control variables. We find that the lagged loan liquidity does not explain the number of investor types in the syndicate, T Y P ES, while it does explain the concentration in the loan syndicate, H H I, but in a way inconsistent with reverse causality. These tests, however, suffer from an important limitation -they rely on annual data. 13 Nonetheless, we also run the tests on term loans B and get equally strong results when we proxy diversity by the number of investor types but weaker results when we do it by the HHI of investor types' loan shares.

Therefore, we add a dummy variable indicating the presence of a loan resale constraint clause to our loan bid-ask spread regressions. We do not find significant liquidity effect of the presence of loan resale constraint, probably because the information on the original loan contract terms is only available for a small subset of our sampled loans and theses terms do not vary over the life of a loan.

These findings are robust and do not seem to be driven by investors' borrower/loan selection. They also do not appear to be driven by the presence of a particular type of investors because they continue to hold when we account for the relative importance of the various types of investors owning the loan. We argue that investor diversity matters for loan liquidity because different types of investors are likely to generate different information about intrinsic loan value, and trading on one type of information is a complement to trading on another type of information (Goldstein and Yang 2015) . These complementarities incentivize more trading, which in turn lead to higher loan liquidity.",

However, several studies, including Plosser and Santos (2018) , Blickle et al. (2020) , and Glaser and Santos (2021) , do not find supporting evidence to the thesis that the lead share proxies for the lead bank's monitoring incentives. Our results show that the lead share plays a part in the liquidity of a loan, depending on whether the lead bank also acts as a dealer for the loan.
