According to the regression coefficient, which is based on the fact that the 95% CI of the point estimate does not include the value 0, the results show the mediation of indirect effects, obtaining three specific indirect effects through Ind1, Ind2 and Ind6. Regarding the significant indirect effects when comparing between pairs, there were no significant differences because the values of each lower and upper limit of the confidence intervals contain the value 0. Therefore, it can be determined that the three mediation pathways have the same level of importance in the model (see Figure 2 ). The first pathway (Ind1) indicates that a poorer subjective sleep quality along with high levels of attention will lead to higher levels of depression. Pathways two and three (Ind2 and Ind6) reveal that poorer subjective sleep quality along with lower levels of emotional clarity lead to higher depression, with model three showing poorer clarity and worse emotional recovery.

Thus, both factors together have the potential to induce similar effects. -Secondly, poor subjective sleep quality, along with low levels of emotional clarity, lead to higher levels of depression. The explanation could be similar to the previous case, that is, poor sleep quality is related to more depressive symptoms, and low levels of emotional clarity are also related to more depressive symptoms, indicating that both factors together may also influence levels of depression. -Thirdly, poor subjective sleep quality, along with low clarity and emotional recovery, implies higher levels of depression.
