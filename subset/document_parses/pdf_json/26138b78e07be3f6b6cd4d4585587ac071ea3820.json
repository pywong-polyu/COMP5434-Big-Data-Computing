            "text": "N OWADAYS many countries are facing labor shortages due to the aging of the population and the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, an ever-increasing amount of attention has been focused on service robots in order to solve these shortages. Intelligent robots require a variety of functionalities, such as perception, manipulation, and navigation in order to safely interact with human users and environments [1] . Among these functionalities, we believe, three-dimensional (3D) object perception plays a significant role because such robots need to recognize which objects exist in the environment and where they are to help users in various tasks. As an example, consider a robot-assisted packaging scenario, where a robot is working alongside a human user (Fig. 1) . In such scenarios, the user may ask the robot to handover a specific object. To accomplish this task, the robot should be able to represent the current state of the environment in terms of objects' pose and category label, and then plan a collision-free trajectory to grasp Fig. 1 . An example of robot-assisted packaging scenario: (left) the dual arm robot perceives the environment through an RGB-D camera, and then plans a collision-free trajectory to grasp the target object, and delivers it to the user; (right) In order to successfully handover a target object to a user, the robot should have a clear understanding of its current configuration (i.e., joint poses) and recognize all objects that are not part of the robot's body. the target object, pick it up, and deliver it to the user. In such collaborative settings, the robot often faces new objects over time and it is not feasible to assume that one can pre-program all object categories for the robot in advance. Furthermore, the human co-worker expects that the robot can easily adapt to different tasks by learning a new set of object categories based on a few instructions.",

            "text": "In such lifelong robot learning scenarios, object representation is crucial because the output of this module is used for both learning and recognition [2] . Most of the object representation approaches encode either geometric features [3] or textural features [4] of an object. However, there are a few works that encode both geometric and textural features simultaneously [5] . Each of these approaches has its own cons and pros. However, to benefit from all of these approaches, an ensemble learning method can be developed, where multiple object recognition methods based on individual representation are trained and their predictions are combined [6] , [7] . Ensemble learning not only reduces the misclassification rate but also provides predictions that are superior to single models. The cost of ensemble learning increases with the number of integrated approaches. Therefore, a trade-off between recognition accuracy and computation time should be considered, otherwise, it becomes computationally untenable for robotics applications.",

The category label of the target object is finally determined based on the majority vote of contributing models. Figure 2 shows an overview of our work. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, we preform extensive sets of experiments concerning recognition accuracy, scalability, robustness to the Gaussian noise and downsampling. Experimental results show that the our approach outperformed the selected stateof-the-art approaches in terms of classification accuracy and scalability. Additionally, the proposed approach demonstrated better robustness compared to other approaches under low and mid-level noise or downsampling conditions.

Note that D train has no known relationship to D f ew (i.e., cross-domain learning). Several studies have shown that the best approach to few-shot learning is to use highquality feature extractor rather than complicated meta-learning (i.e., learning to learn) algorithms [31] - [33] . While we agree with this point, we believe that one representation is insufficient to cover a variety of distributions and the performance can be improved with an ensemble of multiple (deep and handcrafted) representations. There some works that address ensemble of deep networks for few-shot classification [34] - [36] . These approaches are computationally very expensive in both training and testing phases, hence, it is challenging to use them in real-time robotic applications. One way to reduce overhead at the test time, is to train another network to imitate the behavior of the ensemble (i.e., distillation of an ensemble into a single model [37] ). Applying distillation in lifelong learning scenarios is a very challenging task. Unlike these approaches, we proposed lifelong ensemble learning based on multiple handcrafted and deep representations to tackle realtime 3D object recognition tasks.",

In particular, the geometric center of the object is first computed by arithmetically averaging all points of the object.

Therefore, the v 1 , v 2 , v 3 eigenvectors are considered as X, Y, Z axes of the object respectively. The object is finally transformed to be placed in the obtained reference frame. For rendering 2D RGB-D images from a 3D object, we set a\"virtual\" camera in a way that the Z axis of the camera points towards the centroid of the object. Furthermore, the Z axis of the camera is perpendicular to the first two axes of the object, and is parallel to the third axis. Finally, a ray-tracing technique is used to render depth and RGB images of the object, regardless of how accurate/complete the point cloud of the object is. The obtained images are then fed into a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract a deep representation of the object. We first remove the the topmost classification layers of the network, and the then pass both RGB and depth views of the object into networks to receive an embedding for each image. The obtained representations are then concatenated to form a deep representation of the object and used to train a classifier. An illustrative example of this procedure is shown in Fig. 2 , where we generated orthographic views for the scissors.",

Consider an example where a robot faces a new object while working in the environment. In such situations, the robot should be able to learn the new category on-site by observing a few examples of the object, without accessing the old training data and re-training from scratch. This point can be addressed trough lifelong learning, where, the number of categories increases over time based on the robot's observations and interactions with humans.

Although training phase is very fast, the robot should avoid storing redundant instances as it increases memory usage and slows down the recognition process. Similar to [28] , we follow a user centered labeling strategy where the teach and correct actions by the user trigger the robot to store a new instance of a specific category in the memory. Note that the robot can learn object categories in a self-supervise manner. For instances, if the dissimilarity of the given object with all known categories is above a certain threshold, the robot infers that the object does not belong to m known categories and thus initiates a new object category called \"category m + 1\". The problem is that such a category label is not meaningful for a human user, and the user cannot naturally instruct the robot to perform a task, such as \"bring me a cup of tea, please!\". For recognition purposes, we use K nearest neighbors classifier [41] . Therefore, each IBL approach can be considered as a combination of a category model and a dissimilarity measure. Since objects are represented as global features (histograms), the dissimilarity between two objects can be computed by various distance functions. In this paper, we investigate the effect of 10 different distance functions on object recognition performance. A majority voting scheme is then used to combine the predictions of ensemble members to form the final prediction. In the event of a tie vote, the class that has the minimum distance to the query object is selected as the winner (see Fig. 2 ).",

In the case of handcrafted approaches, we considered ESF [11] , VFH [12] , GOOD [9] , and GRSD [39] descriptors, and for deep learning representations, we evaluated Resnet50 [45] , Inception [46] , DenseNet [47] , Inception-ResNet (Incept-Res) [48] and VGG19 [49] . Each of these descriptors has its own parameters that should be optimized to provide a good balance among recognition accuracy, memory usage, and computation time. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the distance functions plays a significant role in IBL methods. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of 10 different distance functions including Cosine, Gower, Motyka, Euclidean, Dice, Sorensen, Pearson, Neyman, Bhattachayya (Bahatta.), KL-divergance (KL div.) on recognition accuracy. We use the Average Class Accuracy (ACA) as a means of deciding which performed better. In particular, ACA= 1",

The ESF descriptor does not have any parameter while VFH and GRSD have a radius parameter which is used to estimate a normal vector for constructing a reference frame. We observed that setting the radius parameter to 0.006 produced the best results. In the case of deep learning approaches, the best results obtained by setting the resolution of input image to 100 \u00d7 100 pixels. The k-parameter for the KNN classifiers was set to 3 for all individual approaches, as we observed that there was generally no improvement in performance with larger values for k for most of the approaches. The remaining parameters of all descriptors are defined as the default values. Results of the best configuration of each method with various distance functions are summarized in Fig. 4 (left and center) . Comparison of the results showed that the majority of the object representation approaches achieved the best recognition accuracy based on Motyka distance function. Additionally, we measured the experiment time for each approach to define which approaches are computationally expensive (see Fig. 4 -right) . Among handcrafted approaches, GRSD descriptor performed considerably worse in terms of recognition accuracy, while ESF, GOOD, and VFH representations demonstrated a good trade-off between recognition accuracy and experiment time. Particularly for real-time applications with limited resources, handcrafted approaches provide a favorable computation time. According to these experiments, Inception-ResNet and VGG19 were computationally expensive to use in ensemble learning methods for robotics applications. In contrast, ResNet50, Inception, and DenseNet offered an acceptable trade-off between recognition accuracy and experiment time (see Fig. 4 (center and right)).",

By comparing all results, it is clear that the ensemble learning approaches outperformed individual methods in terms of object recognition accuracy. It can also be observed that all ensembles performed better than any of the individual approaches. On closer inspection, we can see that by introducing more categories, the accuracy of all approaches decreases. This is expected as the number of categories known by the system increases, the classification task becomes more challenging. Among all approaches, DenseNet and ensemble with only deep representations always maintained accuracy above 90% for all level of scalability. Ensemble with deep-only representations had marginally higher accuracy than the DenseNet. We also observed that the computation of all ensembles are substantially higher than individual base learners. Experimental results indicated that, among all ensemble methods, handcrafted one achieved the best computation time followed by mixture of handcrafted and deep representations. Moreover, we observed that ensemble of deep-only representations is computationally very expensive. To form an ensemble of mixed representations, we considered GOOD, ESF, ResNet50 since these representations demonstrated a good balance between accuracy and computation time. Table I indicates that the ensemble method based on mixture of representations performed better than the ensemble with only handcrafted representations in all level of scalability.

One important observation is that the GOOD base learner showed a stable performance under all level of noises, and outperformed all ensembles and base learners by a large margin. In contrast, the performance of all other base learners decreased drastically as the level of noise increased. Ensemble methods achieved the second best performance, while ResNet, ESF and VFH were very sensitive to Gaussian noise. By comparing the results, it is visible that ensemble methods with handcrafted, and mixed of handcrafted and deep representations, showed exceptionally better accuracy than all base learners excluding the GOOD learner. The underlying reason was that a tie vote occurred frequently, and in most of the cases, the GOOD learner (a member of ensemble) won since it produced the closest representation to the query object. Such results are explained by the fact that GOOD descriptor uses a stable, unique and unambiguous object reference frame that is not affected by noise. We also observed that VFH is highly sensitive to noise as it relies on surface normal estimation to produce the representation of the object. Since ESF uses distances and angles between randomly sampled points to produce a shape description, it is sensitive to noise. In the case of ResNet50, by applying Gaussian noise to the point cloud of the object, the extracted images of the object are changed. Therefore, the deep representation of the object differs significantly from the original representation of the object, resulting in misclassification and poor performance. Overall, these results showed that ensemble learning using mixture of deep and handcrafted representations could yield better results.",

In these experiments, the density of train data was preserved as original while the density of test data was downsampled using ten different voxel sizes, ranging from 1mm to 10mm with a 1mm interval. An illustration example of a Pitcher object with three level of downsampling is shown in Fig. 8 . We summarized the obtained results in Fig. 10 . A comparison of all the results reveals that by increasing the downsampling resolution, the performance of all methods decreased significantly. Furthermore, we can see that all ensemble methods performed better than the individual base-learners in low-and middle resolution downsampling (i.e., DS \u2265 6mm), while in the case of high resolution downsampling (i.e., DS > 6mm), the GOOD descriptor and ResNet50 showed slightly better performance than the ensemble learning methods. Among handcrafted based learners, GOOD showed stable performance for all levels of downsampling while the performance of base learners with VFH and ESF descriptors dropped significantly under high levels of downsampling (see Fig. 10 left). It can be concluded from this observation that the GOOD descriptor is robust to downsampling mainly due to using a unique and stable reference frame, and also normalized orthographic projection, while VFH relies on surface normals estimation and ESF computes several statistical features (i.e., distances and angles between randomly sampled points) to generate a shape description for a given point cloud. In the case of deep representations, all base learners performed very good under low and mid level of downsampling. As the down sampling resolution was increased, the performance of all deep learningbased methods decreased (see Fig. 10 -center) .

The main idea is to imitate the interaction of a robotic agent with the surroundings over a long period of time. In particular, a simulated user introduces new object categories on demand using three randomly selected object views, in the same streaming fashion as would happen in any open-ended environment. The simulated user will then ask the agent to classify a set of never-before-seen instances of the known categories to determine whether the agent is accurate or not. The simulated user provides corrective feedback when the agent misclassifies an object. This way, the agent can improve the model of that specific category using the misclassified object (test-then-train). The simulated user keeps training and evaluating the known category models until a certain protocol threshold \u03c4 has been reached, after which a new category is introduced. We set \u03c4 to 0.67, meaning that the object recognition accuracy of the agent is at least twice as high as its error rate. As soon as a new category is taught, the simulated user tests the agent's performance on all previously learned categories to ensure that no catastrophic interference has occurred. This way the agent could gradually increase its knowledge within a specific context. In case the model is unable to reach the protocol threshold after a certain number of question/correction iterations (QCI), e.g. 100, simulated user stops the experiment, as the agent is unable to learn more categories. An alternative stopping condition would be the \"lack of data\", where the agent learns all categories before reaching the point where no more categories can be learned (see Fig. 12 ). Although a human user could also follow this protocol, following the protocol by a simulated user allows us to perform consistent and reproducible experiments in a fraction of the time a human would take to do the same experiment.",

            "text": "2) Results: To gain a better understanding of the openended learning process, we plotted the performance of the agent in the initial 300 question/correction iterations in Fig. 13 . Initially, the simulated user taught two object categories (spoon and toy-ambulance) to the agent, and progressively evaluated the classification accuracy of the agent after introducing a new object category. If the accuracy of the agent is greater than the protocol threshold (marked by the horizontal green line), a new category is introduced (gelatin-box). The accuracy of the agent remained 100% for the first five categories. After teaching the coke-can category, some misclassification happened and the simulated user provided corrective feedback accordingly. The agent then improved the model of the category and consequently improved its performance. This pattern repeated for three consecutive categories. Upon introducing the juice-box and master-chef-can categories, the agent recognized all known categories without any misclassification, whereas after teaching the bowl category, some misclassifications occurred. Again, the agent improved its knowledge after receiving some feedback. Furthermore, it can be seen that this model could learn many more categories after the first 300 question/correction iterations, given that the protocol accuracy consistently stays above the protocol threshold \u03c4 . We observed that the agent could learn all 90 synthetic object categories Fig. 13 . Evolution of protocol accuracy over first 300 iterations: in this experiment, the simulated user interactively teaches a new object category to the agent and evaluates its performance on all previously learn categories. In particular, if the performance of the agent exceeds a protocol threshold (i.e., set to 0.67, as shown by the green horizontal dashed line), the simulated user introduces a new category (shown by a red dashed line and a category label) and examines the recognition accuracy of the agent on all previously learned categories using never-seen-before instances. after around 4120 QCI iterations. We performed 10 round of experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed ensemble approaches. A detailed summary of all experiments is reported in Table II . Figure 14 shows the recognition performance of the agent versus the number of categories learned. It can be concluded from this plot that the global accuracy of all approaches decreases as the number of categories increased. This is expected since the object recognition task is harder when there are more categories. We also observed that all approaches showed a good performance and the global classification accuracy of the agent remained above the protocol threshold. Overall, the ensemble approach with mixed representations achieved better global classification accuracy than the handcrafted-only and deep-only approaches. Figure 15 shows the average number of instances stored in each category using (top-row) Washington and (lower-row) Synthetic object datasets. In these plots, each bar represents the accumulation of three instances provided at the time the category was introduced and the instances that were corrected by the simulated user somewhere during the experiment. By comparing the results, it is visible that, on average, the ensemble with deep-only representations stored more instances than ensemble with mixed and ensemble with handcraftedonly representations (see Table II ). It can be concluded that the ensemble approach with handcrafted-only and mixed representations outperform ensemble with deep-only representations in terms of QCI (time) and AIC (memory) metrics. On a closer inspection, we observed that as the number of categories increased, misclassifications happened more frequently. Consequently, the agent received more corrective feedback to update the model of categories. It is worth mentioning that the Synthetic dataset contains fine-grained objects, such as a Pringles-onion vs. Pringles-hot. Such similarities undoubtedly make the classification task more challenging. Therefore, on average, experiments on the Synthetic dataset took longer QCI.",

To accomplish the task successfully, the robot must initially detect and recognize all objects correctly, then pick the target object, and deliver it to the user. The user finally put the object into the box. Note that the robot used its right arm to manipulate the target object if it was on the right side of the robot, otherwise, the robot used its left arm. We repeated this experiment with various sets of objects 10 times. We observed that the robot was able to learn and recognize all objects correctly and deliver them to the user successfully.

More specifically, we formulate several ensemble methods based on deep-only, handcrafted-only, and a mixture of handcrafted and deep representations. To facilitate open-ended learning, each of the base learners has a memory unit to store and retrieve object category information instantly. To assess the proposed approach in offline, and open-ended settings, we generated a large synthetic object dataset, consisting of 27000 views of 90 household object categories. Furthermore, we used two real 3D object datasets. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the ensemble approaches on (few-shot) 3D object recognition tasks, as well as their superior lifelong learning performance over the state-of-the-art approaches. Among the ensemble learning methods, although the ensemble method with deep-only representations achieved slightly better recognition accuracy, it was computationally very expensive for robotics applications. We observed that the ensemble method with mixture of handcrafted and deep representations showed a better trade-off between accuracy and computation time. We also demonstrated the real-time performance of the proposed approach in a set of real and simulated robotics experiments. In the simulation, we assessed the performance of the robot in the context of \"set-the-table\" task, while in the case of real-robot, we considered a \"robotassisted-packaging\" scenario. In both sets of experiments, the robot could learn and recognize all objects correctly and accomplish the tasks successfully.",

In particular, \u03c4 is the threshold accuracy which must be reached before a new category is introduced by the simulated user. Therefore, we performed two set of experiments by setting the \u03c4 \u2208 {0.8, 0.9} to see how well the agent performed with a stricter simulated user. Results are reported inTable III. By setting the \u03c4 = 0.8, although our ensembles still could learn all 51 categories, the ensemble of deep-only representations requires more iterations than ensemble with mixed and handcrafted-only representations. These results indicate that ensemble with mixed representations showed a better performance than ensembles with deep-only and handcrafted-only representations. Further increasing the protocol threshold to 0.9 made learning new categories harder, and the agent could only learn 27, 30, and 36 categories with deep-only, handcrafted-only, and mixed representations, respectively.",
