            "text": "In addition to respiratory complications produced by SARS-CoV-2, accumulating evidence suggests that some neurological symptoms are associated with the disease caused by this coronavirus. In this study, we investigated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 stimulation on neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. Analyses of culture supernatants revealed an increase in the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and iNOS/NO. S1 also increased protein levels of phospho-p65 and phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1, as well as enhanced DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB. These effects of the protein were blocked in the presence of BAY11-7082 (1 \u00b5M). Exposure of S1 to BV-2 microglia also increased the protein levels of NLRP3 inflammasome and enhanced caspase-1 activity. Increased protein levels of p38 MAPK was observed in BV-2 microglia stimulated with the spike protein S1 (100 ng/ml), an action that was reduced in the presence of SKF 86,002 (1 \u00b5M). Results of immunofluorescence microscopy showed an increase in TLR4 protein expression in S1-stimulated BV-2 microglia. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition with TAK 242 (1 \u00b5M) and transfection with TLR4 small interfering RNA resulted in significant reduction in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production in S1-stimulated BV-2 microglia. These results have provided the first evidence demonstrating S1-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. We propose that induction of neuroinflammation by this protein in the microglia is mediated through activation of NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK, possibly as a result of TLR4 activation. These results contribute to our understanding of some of the mechanisms involved in CNS pathologies of SARS-CoV-2.",

Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 sub-unit S1 has been shown in a study to promote loss of barrier integrity and trigger a pro-inflammatory response in a 3D model of the human blood-brain barrier [9] , suggesting a possible mechanism for the neurological symptoms induced by the coronavirus. Other studies have proposed mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-mediated CNS dysfunction [10, 11] .

In the resting state, microglia survey their surrounding microenvironment through the projection and retraction of their highly motile processes [13] . However, in the presence of injury or pathology within the CNS, they become activated [14] . During neuroinflammation, polarised M1 microglia produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic molecules, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contribute to neuronal dysfunction, while polarised M2 microglia secrete anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, which are involved in restoring homeostasis [15] [16] [17] [18] . Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation therefore plays significant roles in many neurological [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] and neuropsychiatric [24] [25] [26] [27] disorders. Based on evidence linking SARS-CoV-2 infection with neurological symptoms, we carried out investigations to determine the effects of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit on the release of pro-inflammatory mediators in BV-2 microglia.",

Interestingly, pre-treatment of BV-2 cells with BAY11-7082 (1 \u00b5M) prior to stimulation with S1 produced an inhibition in binding to a doublestranded DNA sequence containing the NF-\u03baB response element (Fig. 4C) . Luciferase reporter gene assays to evaluate the effects of S1 on transcriptional activity showed that S1 stimulation of BV-2 microglia that were transfected with NF-\u03baB plasmid vector resulted in a significant (p < 0.01) increase in luciferase activity, in comparison with untreated transfected cells. We further showed that on pre-treating the cells with BAY11-7082 (1 \u00b5M), an S1-induced increase in NF-\u03baB luciferase activity was markedly reduced (Fig. 4D) . expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM for three independent experiments.

We further showed that activation of microglial NF-\u03baB signalling mediates the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in the microglia by SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein through its ability to promote cytoplasmic phosphorylation of the p65 sub-unit and I\u03baB\u03b1, as well as the DNA binding of p65 sub-unit and NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity. Interestingly, these effects were blocked by the potent NF-\u03baB inhibitor BAY11-7082. The involvement of NF-\u03baB in S1 protein-induced neuroinflammation was further confirmed by results showing the effectiveness of BAY11-7082 in blocking S1-induced production of TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, and iNOS/NO in BV-2 microglia. In a similar study reported by Patra et al. [47] , SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was shown to promote IL-6 signalling through NF-\u03baB in epithelial cells to initiate coordination of a hyperinflammatory response. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence demonstrating the role of NF-\u03baB activation in S1-induced microglial activation.",

            "text": "Reports in scientific literature suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome may be contributing to the release of cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 in SARS-CoV-2-induced hyperinflammation [48] [49] [50] . In the microglia, activation of NLRP3 by extracellular ATP, certain bacterial toxins and crystalline and particulate matters results in caspase-1 activation which then cleaves the precursors of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 to generate active IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, resulting in neuroinflammation and pyroptosis [51] [52] [53] . In this study, we showed that in addition to increasing IL-1\u03b2 production, SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein activated NLRP3 inflammasome and increased caspase-1 activity in BV-2 microglia. These effects were also shown to be attenuated by CRID3 and BAY11-7082, which are known inhibitors of NLRP3. Furthermore, pre-treatment of BV-2 microglia with CRID3 prevented SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein-induced IL-1\u03b2 production, but not TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 or NO, suggesting an involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in neuroinflammation induced by S1 in BV-2 microglia. The observed effects of BAY11-7082 on both NF-\u03baB A B C D Fig. 8 Stimulation of BV-2 microglia with S1 (100ng/ml) increased the protein expression ofphospho-p38 MAPK (A), which wasinhibited in the presence of SKF 86002 (1 \u03bcM). Data wereanalysed using one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey's multiple comparisontest. **p < 0.01, compared withuntreated control or S1 stimulation alone. Effects of SKF 86002 (1 \u03bcM) on S1-induced increased production of TNFa (B), IL-6 (C) and IL-1\u03b2 (D) in BV-2microglia. Culture supernatants were analysed using ELISA following stimulationfor 24h. Data were analysed using one-way ANOVAfollowed by a post hoc Tukey's multiple comparison test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, ns (not significant at p<0.05), compared with untreated control, or S1stimulation alone and NLRP3 activation in S1-stimulated BV-2 microglia reflect a potential therapeutic benefit of this compound in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previous studies on this inhibitor of NF-\u03baB have shown that it improved survival and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected mice [54] . It has been suggested that activation of NF-\u03baB could trigger NLRP3 through caspase-1, with subsequent release A B C D E Fig. 9 Immunofluorescence microscopy showing anincrease in TLR4 protein expression following stimulation of BV-2 microgliawith S1 (100 ng/mL) (A).Pre-treatment of S1-stimulated BV-2 microglia with TAK 242 (1 \u03bcM) reduced the production of TNF\u03b1 (B) and IL-6 (C).

It is not clear from this study if the activation of NLRP3/caspase-1 by S1 was due to a direct effect on NLRP3 or an indirect action as a result of activating NF-\u03baB. The role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in S1-induced neuroinflammation therefore requires further investigation.",
