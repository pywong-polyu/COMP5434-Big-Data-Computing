            "text": "Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictive measures have caused important disruptions in economies and labour markets, changed the way we work and socialise, forced schools to close and healthcare and social services to reorganise. This unprecedented crisis forces individuals to make considerable efforts to adapt and will have psychological and social consequences, mainly on vulnerable individuals, that will remain once the pandemic is contained and will most likely exacerbate existing social and gender health inequalities. This crisis also puts a toll on the capacity of our healthcare and social services structures to provide timely and adequate care. The MAVIPAN (Ma vie et la pand\u00e9mie/ My Life and the Pandemic) study aims to document how individuals, families, healthcare workers and health organisations are affected by the pandemic and how they adapt. Methods and analysis MAVIPAN is a 5-year longitudinal prospective cohort study launched in April 2020 across the province of Quebec (Canada). Quantitative data will be collected through online questionnaires (4-6 times/year) according to the evolution of the pandemic. Qualitative data will be collected with individual and group interviews and will seek to deepen our understanding of coping strategies. Analysis will be conducted under a mixedmethod umbrella, with both sequential and simultaneous analyses of quantitative and qualitative data. Ethics and dissemination MAVIPAN aims to support the healthcare and social services system response by providing high-quality, real-time information needed to identify those who are most affected by the pandemic and by guiding public health authorities' decision making regarding intervention and resource allocation to mitigate these impacts. MAVIPAN was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Primary Care and Population Health Research Sector of CIUSSS de la Capitale-Nationale (Committee of record) and of the additional participating institutions. Trial registration number NCT04575571.",

            "text": "The health crisis imposed by COVID-19 is forcing major worldwide reorganisation that will have profound consequences on our society. 1 Affected countries have been attempting to contain the spread of the virus by requiring extraordinary isolation efforts from their populations. 2 3 One-third of the world's population (~3 billion individuals) has, is or will again experience some kind of isolation measures, causing an unprecedented and rapidly evolving psychosocial crisis. [4] [5] [6] [7] While biomedical research is relentlessly pursuing its efforts to understand the impact of the disease on infected individuals and to develop new treatments and vaccines, its psychosocial consequences that could affect our well-being, the state of our health system and our society cannot be ignored. 5 8-10 Failure to address psychosocial and health issues will prolong the impact of the pandemic for years to come. The psychosocial consequences of this health crisis will spare no one, particularly vulnerable individuals, and will persist long after restriction measures are lifted and the pandemic is over. 5 9 11 12 The combination of professional changes, the state of being 'at risk', the possible loss of employment, the resulting economic difficulties, changes in couple and family dynamics, school closures and the reduction of services in health and social services network may all have an impact on the adjustment and development of individuals of all ages. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] This impact will be significant for individuals facing unique contexts or challenges (eg, older adults, individuals living with a disability, individuals with a chronic or mental health condition, underprivileged families) and will most likely exacerbate existing social, racial and gender inequalities in health. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] The scale of the current COVID-19 mobilisation has destabilised several aspects of our health and social services structures. Services are being suspended, others are being maintained or intensified, and new intervention strategies are rapidly being adopted to adjust to containment measures or risk of virus transmission. 26 27 Service interruptions, among others, have an impact on the physical and mental health and subsequent development of already vulnerable individuals. 28 Health and social services workers are experiencing major changes in their practice during this crisis. 9 29 Many of these workers bear constant witness to the human toll of the pandemic and, all too often, become part of it. 9 30 31 This occurs in a context where these workers are subject to the same measures as the rest of the population, thus placing greater demands on their ability to adapt. 30 32 33 It is crucial to document practice changes and adjustments of these individuals, who must remain available for their family, colleagues and the population.",

Working toward that goal, through constantly evolving research questions responsive to the pandemic evolution and knowledge users' (KUs) needs, we will document, monitor, and evaluate the following: 1. Individual and family adjustment and mitigation strategies, especially for those considered vulnerable and in high-risk contexts (eg, What are the psychosocial and professional characteristics of the most vulnerable participants? What are the characteristics of those who seem to be coping well and who may have even improved during confinement? How are families coping over time?) 2. Healthcare, social services and front-line worker adjustment and mitigation strategies (eg, What is the role of coping and adaptive strategies on the well-being and psychological health of our workers? Are there specific sectors of activity or levels of responsibility that are more vulnerable to adjustment issues? What are the predictive factors of burnout among healthcare workers?). 3. The organisation of service structures (eg, What are the mental health and social service needs unrelated to COVID-19 that are not covered or poorly covered by current services? How have some services reorganised to provide appropriate levels of care and minimise barriers to care delivery?). 4. The social and economic response (eg, What are the economic, social and community-based initiatives that have contributed to mental health wellness? What health or social services should be prioritised on another confinement?). We have established strategic research priorities under key themes to address our objectives. We have identified health inequities and mental health as cross-cutting themes across our objectives. Additional key themes have Open access emerged from sources most likely to increase vulnerability during this health crisis: social environment and health, chronic diseases and disabilities, and front-line, health and social workers. Together, these strategic research priorities will be used as an evolving roadmap to assess the level and extent to which we are addressing our research objectives in a way that meets the needs of KUs and keep up with the state of current knowledge.",

The longitudinal aspect of the cohort sets itself apart. The collection of information related to the same individual at multiple points throughout the evolution of the crisis allows for a unique understanding and insights into mechanisms at play, temporal relationships with key crisis events, and the persistent or transient nature of the psychosocial impacts, and can inform when and how to intervene. 46 47 The use of mixed methods is well-suited for this proposal and adds to its significance. 48 Quantitative data measure indicators, determinants, and impacts (short, mid and long term).

Our nonprobabilistic purposive sampling approach may lead to some bias such as sampling error, self-selection and the lack of or over representation of groups of population. The use of online questionnaire may induce a selection bias toward people with access to the Internet and high digital literacy and limit the reach to more vulnerable populations that are important for this study. We do not have a prepandemic measure with the same sample, which makes it harder to infer a causal role to the pandemic and to contextualise our baseline data with regard to prepandemic levels.",
