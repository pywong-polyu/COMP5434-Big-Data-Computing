This is mostly due to the virus's polymerase, which is inherently prone to mistakes, and host immune system selection factors. Many concerns about different mutations in the spike protein surfaced in the previous year. On November 26, 2021 , the World Health Organization (WHO) classified Omicron as a variant of concern (VOC) after it was discovered in Botswana. The Omicron variant does have more mutations than prior variants, with many of them occurring in the spike protein's receptor binding domain 2 . Despite the spread of several COVID-19 waves over the world, no variant has accumulated mutations or allowed immune evasion to the extent that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has. The Omicron variant has more than 50 mutations, including 26-32 amino acid substitutions, deletions, and insertions 9 3 . The pandemic response strategy for COVID-19 is dependent on the development of treatment options and vaccine formulations [4] [5] [6] [7] . Numerous Omicron mutations, on the other hand, have not been discovered in prior VOCs, and their functional implications have not been thoroughly investigated. However, the discovery of multiple unidentified Omicron mutations inside dominant antibody epitopes has raised worries that vaccination and therapeutic antibody effectiveness may be drastically diminished, necessitating new strategic considerations and research objectives.",

Using the PredictSNP web server, prediction algorithms from programmes like as MAPP, PolyPhen1 and PolyPhen-2, SIFT, SNAP, and PANTHER were utilised to achieve a consensus pathogenicity score. The degree of high accuracy is high due to the consensus technique. 3 has a lower molecular weight than Wuhan-Hu-1 owing to the absence of six amino acid residues, but BA.2, BA.1.1 and BA.1 have slightly greater molecular weight than Wuhan-Hu-1 despite the absence of three amino acid residues. A pI number more than 7 indicates that the protein is alkaline, whereas a value less than 7 suggests that the protein is acidic. The theoretical pI of wildtype is 6.24, whereas both BA.1, BA.1.1 have a theoretical pI of 7.14, BA.2 has a theoretical pI of 7.16, and BA.3 has a theoretical pI of 7.35. Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 are shown to be more alkaline than wildtype. According to previous studies, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is somewhat more positively charged than the SARS-CoV protein, which may result in a greater propensity for binding to negatively charged areas of other molecules through nonspecific and selective interactions 25 . According to our data, the wild type's expected charged residues (Arg + Lys) are 103, both BA.1 and BA.1.1 anticipated charged residues are 111, BA.2 predicted charged residues are 108, and BA.3's predicted charged residues are 109. We noticed that BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.2 all contain significantly more positively charged amino acids (Arg + Lys) than the wild type, which may improve their propensity for binding to negatively charged areas of other molecules such as ACE2. According to the instability index, proteins with a stability score of less than 40 have a stable structure. We observed that all BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 (34.21-34.69) are as slight improved stability as compared to wildtype (33.01) 26 . Aliphatic index, a positive factor associated with improved thermostability of proteins, is 84.67 for wild type, 84.95 for BA.1, BA.1.1, 84.72 for BA.2, and 85.15 for BA.3, indicating that corroborated its stability over a wide range of temperature regime. According to recent study 27 , increased Omicron thermal stability may result in increased persistence of Omicron in exposed surroundings, posing a greater risk of transmission among household contacts than the Delta form. Increased stability may facilitate viral attachment to host cells by increasing the efficacy of receptor recognition, but it may impair viral membrane fusion.",

The divergence suggests that the sub-variants evolved resistance in different immune pressure, possibly in different hosts. All four Omicron lineages has common mutation at Receptor-binding Motif (RBM) region (437-508 a.a) which binds to hACE2 are N440K, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H ( Figure 2E ). There is one unique mutation at RBM for BA.1 at G446S. According to recent study 33 , during cross-species transmission, SARS-CoV-2 may develop to adapt to a variety of hosts, which inherently favours SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Previously, RBD residues 493, 498, and 501 were identified as key locations for the SARS-CoV-2 host range. Therefore, residues 493, 498, and 501, as well as other changes to omicron's RBD, are likely to alter the host spectrum of SARS-CoV-2, and the possibility of an omicron variant overcoming the species barrier must be examined further in the future.",

Multiple RBD mutations increase infectivity, which seems to be the case with Omicron, and so appears to be a viable infection pathway.

The selected cluster models were downloaded in PDB format for further analysis. The homology model is docked with hACE2 for BA.2 and BA.3. The docking energy of WT is -799.6 with hACE2, the docking energy of BA.1 is -943.4 with hACE2, the docking energy for BA.1.1 is -946.8, the docking energy of BA.2 is -974.0 with hACE2, and the docking energy of BA.3 is -999.3 with hACE2. Docking results show that BA.1, BA1.1, BA.2 and BA.3 has a greater affinity for hACE2 than wild type, implying that it has a higher potential for transmission than wild type. We observed among Omicron, BA.2 and BA.3 have a higher affinity for hACE2 than wild type and BA.1, indicating that they had a higher potential for transmission than BA.1 based on both protein-protein docking servers.

Among fourway comparison between Omicron and Sub-variants, for BA.1.1 has one unique mutation R346K, for BA.2 has 8 unique mutation T19I, L24del (deletion), P25del, P26del, A27S, V213G, T376A, R408S and for BA.3 has 1 unique mutation R216del.

Due to triple mutation at the furin cleavage site, such as H655Y, N679K, and P681H Omicron (BA.1) is reported to be extremely transmissible from previous findings 30 .

This demonstrates that the overall RBD protein structure of BA.2 and BA.3 is reliable. TM-align tool generates optimum residue-to-residue alignment based on structural similarity using heuristic dynamic programming iterations; scores greater than 0.5 presume the same fold in general. Based on TM-align findings, the RMSD value for all BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 is 0.68 based on superposition with wild type. This reveals that Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3) have the same structural topology and fold as the wild type. Geometric and topological properties of protein structures, including surface pockets, interior cavities, and cross channels, are of fundamental importance for proteins to carry out their functions. The binding pocket shown in solvent accessible surface area, volume) was predicted for wild type and for Omicron (BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3) using CASTp 3.0. The binding pocket of wild type area is 73.39 and volume is 60.83. For both BA.1, BA.1.1 calculated area is 93.87 and volume is 37.52. For BA.2 predicted area is 49.03 and calculated volume is 16.44. For BA.3, the predicted area is 49.03 and volume predicted is 16.43. From the analysis binding pocket area increased for BA.1 than wild type, while BA.2 and BA.3 decreased whereas binding pocket volume decreases for all BA.1, BA.2 and BA.",
