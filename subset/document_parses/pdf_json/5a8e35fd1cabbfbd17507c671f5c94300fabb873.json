The article outlines the curious mediaverse of religious nationalism-its post-truth and fake news aspects in particular-links religious nationalism to American exceptionalism, and analyzes conflicts between secular and religious authorities. Drawing upon some lessons from the past, the article addresses the wider implications of Christian nationalism on American politics, and capitalist ideology, as it has been played out virally in the corporate media. The article shows that the ideological underpinnings of evangelical Christianity prevent its proponents from understanding the virus in an historical and materialist manner and points toward more epistemically sound approaches to relationships between science and religion. It concludes that privatization, austerity capitalism, and 'gig economy' need to be replaced by socialist alternatives and seeks inspiration in theory and practice of Marxism and South American liberation theology.",

His target? The USNS Mercy, a Navy medical ship that's been assisting nearby hospitals with COVID-19 patients.' The rationale given by the train engineer is enough to cause even the most reserved introvert to spit fire. Marcotte elaborates: 'Apparently, Moreno believes in a conspiracy theory that the coronavirus crisis is a hoax being deployed to cover for a shadowy takeover of the government. ' Will Sommer (2020) reported on an Illinois woman inspired by pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory videos who traveled to New York City armed with more than a dozen knives and who intended to kill former Vice President Joe Biden. She tried to get near to the US Navy Hospital Ship Comfort, the hospital ship that was sent to New York City to help with the coronavirus pandemic, but mistook the Comfort for the USS Intrepid, a 'retired' aircraft carrier. Like many QAnon believers, she had become obsessed with the Comfort, convinced that it's being used to rescue 'mole children' from the clutches of liberal elites who enjoy sodomizing and then cannibalizing young children. Some of these same conspiracy theorists believe that children are being held hostage in secret tunnels beneath city streets by liberal democrats to be used in rituals designed to conjure Satan. A vigilant Trump was apparently onto them in a thrice and is preparing to bring the evil doers to justice.",

            "text": "When it comes to the current coronavirus pandemic, Italian author Francesca Melandri writes: 'Class will make all the difference. Being locked up in a house with a pretty garden is not the same as living in an overcrowded housing project. Nor is being able to work from home or seeing your job disappear' (Tricontinental 2020) . In this world held captive by CoronaShock, the working class, the daily wage workers and migrant workers from around the globe who manage to survive being killed by the coronavirus, face the horror of not being able to provide food and shelter for their families-assuming that they already have a place to shelter themselves and their loved ones. Some of those who survive will likely end up on the assembly lines of high-tech security companies making IP (Internet protocol) cameras-Bosch Security Systems, Canon, Arecont Vision, Avigilon-that will help to monitor them once the coronavirus pandemic is curtailed and life goes on. But it will not be life as usual. It will be life in an updated, refurbished postdigital panopticon (Jandri\u0107 et al. 2018; Peters 2020) . During the pandemic, Devega (2020) predicts that 'many people will embrace being monitored and tracked. The ability of an authoritarian regime to co-opt that technologysome of which is already in use by Google, for exampleis very frightening. ' And in this toxic mix of circumstances-where we are saddled with a president who has claimed that a final US coronavirus death toll of approximately 100,000 to 200,000 people would indicate that his administration has 'done a very good job' (Rupar 2020 )-the evangelical community is putting countless numbers of people at risk by refusing to stop holding large church gatherings and refusing to cease its decades long attack on science. In the USA the evangelical community has found a second-tier messiah in the person of Donald Trump (McLaren and Jandri\u0107 2020a). Christian nationalism in the age of Trump is a religious virus that gives no respite to its hostthe commonweal and its enduring search for spiritual and material prosperity. But Trump is no fool when it comes to pleasing his base-he had been cannily throwing them red meat long before his run for president. And as president he is well on the way to defunding Planned Parenthood and, in the mind of many evangelicals, to bringing about the biblical apocalypse.",

But it is increasingly clear that Trump has identified himself with charismatic, Pentecostal, and evangelical Christianity, largely for political reasons-their practitioners perceive him as a divine instrument of God and are prevalent in key states important for Trump's reelection chances. I am largely against religious states in principle, and have said so when speaking in Israel, or Pakistan, or the West Bank (Palestine). I have always supported freedom of religion within a secular state apparatus open to a wide range of religious faiths. And I have always defended 'the separation of church and state' (Thomas Jefferson's phrase) in articulating my understanding of the intent and function of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution which reads: 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...' (see McLaren and Jandri\u0107 2020b) . Ignoring the Constitution, those who have helped to manufacture the virus of Christian nationalism boast no need of critical sobriety and less need for metropolitan intellectuals with their incessant insistence on finding new ways to clamp down on what they see as the necessary separation of church and state. Christian nationalism is a sickness that poisons every ethico-political reservoir of hope and possibility with a fatal hubris. For decades, the messages of prosperity preachers have hollowed into my mind, sometimes in the form of a revolving worm announced by a roll of thundering apocalyptic prose and on other occasions like a flaming corpse decamped from the grave of undiscovered history. And in my most paranoid moments, they take the shape of unclean spirits shooting like roman candles from some pungent, weed-strewn sepulcher right out of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.",

But that would be a serious miscalculation. What cannot be denied is that Christian nationalism in the age of Trump and his disaster capitalism cabinet stalks the halls of the White House and the nation's airwaves like Marx and Engels' hobgoblin rudely awakened from the depths of oblivion. Former evangelical Frank Schaeffer states: 'We're at a time now when the naked lickspittle enablement of Donald Trump by his evangelical followers is more horrifying than ever\u2026' (Schaeffer in Boggioni 2020a). He goes on to say: 'When we come to this time of COVID-19 overtaking our country, a literal life and death issue, we see two things very clearly\u2026. One is the utter moral bankruptcy of this leader who pits himself against governors trying to save their people, and the second is the utter moral bankruptcy of evangelical, the white evangelical voter.' (Schaeffer in Boggioni 2020a) After being placed in charge of the coronavirus crisis, the first action undertaken by Mike Pence was to form a prayer circle with evangelical supporters. Later, the state of Oklahoma held a statewide prayer day where megachurch pastors from all over the state appeared with Gov. Kevin Stitt (R-OK) to try and pray away the coronavirus. And, of course, prayer circles popped up all over the country. That would not be so bad if these titans of Christian power were not part of a long tradition that was infamously anti-science. Rational-and religious-minded citizens as well as atheists (and I count myself as among the former group) have no immunity to this type of siege, to this type of Hobbesian war of all against all; we have no Maid of Orl\u00e9ans armor of God that can protect us from the battlefield tactics of idolatrous Trumplar Knights, from this inescapably salty theology creeping up our spine like a winter chill at a Nova Scotian fishing village, and from this widespread winnowing of reason, this twitterverse phrasemongering pitched from a Mar-a-Lago golf course caddy shack. The Trump cults that operate like impassioned yet enigmatic love functionaries for Jesus and the 45th president regularly hand over our future to corporations (which Chomsky refers to as 'private tyrannies') (Falcone 2015) , a measure tantamount to having a spiritual death wish that will surely lead to self-destructive turmoil, if not a fate more harrowing than even end times prophets can wrench from the moribund secrets hidden within ancient scrolls discovered on episodes of The Naked Archeologist.",

And once Trump was elected, reshuffled the government, and began to communicate through Twitter, the tribal conditions were set in place. Twitter for Trump is equivalent to the microphone at the lectionary of a church. From here he can dictate the catechism for the day's events. The compatibility and mutual buttressing between the secular state and the evangelical community redound to the Trump administration, solidifying his Christian base while accentuating the chasm between the illegitimate state and the 'true' religious calling of the country to bring freedom to all nations of the world, whether this includes imposing sanctions or bombing those countries back to the Stone Age. The Hebraic idea of people enjoying a special covenant with God has had an impact on Northern Irish, Afrikaner, and Israeli nationalism-and also on US nationalism (Grzymala-Busse 2019). The narratives of nations as divinely 'chosen people' have merged religious and national identities in these countries, and I would say that Trump's moving of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem certainly has secured the gratitude of many Israelis and Christians who believe that this action brings the world one step closer to Armageddon and the coming of the Messiah-for Christians this would mean that Jesus would establish the Kingdom of God on earth and 'true' Christians who had repented their sins would receive heaven as their reward. The pandemic for some is seen as a 'divine reset.' Get ready!

While it might be that those totemic entities known as sports have displaced religion as the chief factor in human group relationships in the USA, religion is still going strong. Just witness how many Americans today believe in angels. Some reports say 8 in 10 (CBS News 2011).",

If the prosperity preachers are wincing from criticisms by fellow evangelicals, they certainly know how to hide it as they continue to double down on their convictions. Their embrace of Trump-who before his presidency rarely ventured into spiritually loaded territory-has been widely documented, and commentaries that have offloaded scathing criticism are not difficult to find. The evangelical community continues to preen itself as the spokesperson for the correct trajectory of today's political Christianity and in doing so has proclaimed Donald Trump as the new Christian messiah (McLaren and Jandri\u0107 2020a). We've all seen their performances on television or in person-the flair, the fanfare, the bargain basement pageantry, and the carnivalesque world of sensations. Have you ever seen a video of Paula White speaking in tongues? Just watch some old reruns of Robert Tilton's show, Success-N-Life, and you might see where she got some of her tonguetwisting blubbering. (Personally, I prefer Tilton's haut couture glossolalia; he's the Donald Trump of charismatic prayer language, the king of sanctifying gibberishapologies to Pat Boone.) Mahte Ke Sodoebo!

It's been effective against SARS and HIV. Wiped them right out! Yes, this type of religiously tainted ideological muck is suffused all around us: a Chuck E. Cheese attempt at creating a rarified air of sanctity, a pantheon of kitsch religious props, and an obsessive overlighting of the preacher on center stage clog dancing to the delicate harmony of a Cheyenne Frontier Days' tie-down rodeo act. The whacky outpourings of the preacher, declaimed before a wildly effusive live audience, are often compelling in their allusive religiosity and emotional spirituality-Thank you Jesus! Praise God!-yet devastating in their theological barrenness, pushing scripture beyond its semantic and semiotic limits. Betty, put down that textbook on evolution! I've been telling you since you were in kindergarten that human beings co-existed with dinosaurs and maybe even tamed some of the smaller ones and kept them as pets. Didn't you watch the Flintstones when you were growing up? No-you were too busy watching that communist Mr. Rogers! A splashy aestheticism stands in for what we might hope to be the sepulchral depths of an impassioned religious celebration.

Could this type of spectacle be a twentieth-century remnant of biblical literalism or the detritus of an arch monasticism so spiritually claustrophobic that it finally led to a mass exodus to the cities? Could religious hysteria have slowly trickled down through the ages, only to be rekindled in big tent revivalism and the eventual appearance of the praise-be-to-God-amening-hallelujahing Grahams, Falwells, Robertsons, Swaggarts, Whites, Tiltons, Bakkers, and others of this grandstanding, self-serving ilk? Could it be that God is having a Kayleigh McEnany-type meltdown? Or can the spectacle be traced to something more recent? A sloppy metaphysics spun from the lecture halls of Liberty University perhaps? An overweening estimation of the power of suggestion? An increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex that can be correlated with inclinations toward social justice, Christian morality, Aristotelian ethics, and liberation theology as opposed to those with increased gray matter volume in the amygdala (which is part of the limbic system concerned with emotions) that could be associated with alt-right adjacent evangelical Christianity and political conservatism?

Or, simply put, is the lock-step attachment of evangelicals to Trump more of a case of just plain hypocrisy on the part of the contemporary evangelical leadership? Surely there is much more to the story. And there is. Benjamin E. Park (2018) writes that during times of national or international crisis, the power of religious rhetoric is a force that can always be counted on historically to focus on and reinvigorate the idea of American nationalism. And in recent years, its singular purpose has been to connect Christianity with the Republican Party, which can be seen in the Moral Majority's ascension to the national stage in the 1980s and its connection to Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party (Park 2018) .",

The French revolution influenced America's concept of exceptionalism and placed Christianity at the center of the idea of patriotism (Park 2018) . There was fear that the French Revolution was a threat to Christianity globally. And the influence of writers such as Thomas Paine became a concern of major significance since he was in favor of banishing religion from society and embracing secularism in its stead and embracing the Enlightenment commitment to universal rationalism as a challenge to religious authority and authoritarianism. Consequently, Park (2018) writes that '[i]n a world of growing secularism, the United States is presented as a last refuge for explicit Christian devotion.' And in recent times, burgeoning religious nationalism has 'even made possible one of the unlikeliest of alliances: the loyalty between evangelical ministers and Donald Trump.'",

[Feb. 13] 'There's a theory that, in April, when it gets warmhistorically, that has been able to kill the virus. So we don't know yet; we're not sure yet.' [Feb. 14] 'I think it's going to work out fine. I think when we get into April, in the warmer weather, that has a very negative effect on that and that type of a virus.' [Feb. 14] On Feb. 10, there were 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University. Now there are nearly 200,000. And on Tuesday, the death toll in the U.S. surpassed 3,000, making the virus more deadly than the 9/11 terrorist attacks that reshaped much of American life. Who knows how many people will have died as the result of the coronavirus by the time this article sees print? (Terkel 2020) Trump has referred to the Covid-19 as the 'corona flu,' minimizing its potential to wreak lethal havoc on the US population. Geriatric populations especially are at major risk. Mike Davis (2020) reports that the death rate among those over 65 is 23% in Italy and 18% in Britain. Because of the shortage or unavailability of test kits, containment in the USA is virtually impossible, and without testing it is difficult to ascertain the size of the infected population. Davis (2020) reminds us that 'this virus is mutating as it courses through populations with different age compositions and acquired immunities.' Davis (2020) also points out that`even if the virus remains stable and little mutated, its impact on under-65 age cohorts can differ radically in poor countries and amongst high poverty groups.' Davis admonishes journalists and Western governments for egregiously ignoring the threat of the coronavirus to the global poor. He warns us that '[t]he only certainty is that rich countries and rich classes will focus on saving themselves to the exclusion of international solidarity and medical aid. Walls not vaccines: could there be a more evil template for the future?'",

Davis notes (2020) that 'ER conditions in such institutions are already unable to cope with seasonal infections, so how will they cope with an imminent overload of critical cases?'. Already '380,000 nursing home patients die every year from facilities' neglect of basic infection control procedures.' Nursing homes are very likely to become 'coronavirus hotspots.' Davis (2020) underscores the unwillingness of Big Pharma to participate in the development of new antibiotics and antivirals, remarking that '[o]f the 18 largest pharmaceutical companies, 15 have totally abandoned the field.' They are more interested in producing profits by churning out tranquilizers, pain killers, and Viagra. Davis warns that`[a]s the antibiotic revolution is rolled back, old diseases will reappear alongside novel infections and hospitals will become charnel houses.'",

Plenty of tests!) get their misinformation reinforced by an outlet that seeks as its main goal to support the president. (Rubin in Burris 2020a) Clearly Trump is no 1950s' Commando Cody-type hero, when it comes to a national crisis. Commando Cody defended us from the Radar Men from the Moon. Trump cannot make enough test kits available for the American public. In fact, he has clearly exacerbated the crisis by dint of his initial cavalier attitude toward it. And yet, even the medical experts have waffled on exactly how to fight the virus. At first they said that Americans do not need to wear masks; then they changed their minds. Kenen and Roubein (2020) report: 'The agency said the virus spread through \"droplets\" from coughs and sneezesbut then warned about catching it from people with no symptoms, or even from surfaces, like subway turnstiles or metal shopping carts. It said young people are at low riskbut the hospital beds and morgues of New York called that into question.' And while confusion has reigned supreme among the Trump administration, including its medical teams, what is very clear is that the country should be practicing social distancing and residents should remain in their homes unless they are part of essential services to the community.",

Hey, let us go to the beach today, honey, it's a nice sunny day! Thanks to the slavish veneration that they afford their man-child master in his war against America, Trump's cult followers are more receptive to the idea that the coronavirus should be called the 'China virus.' Hey, let us make the virus the fault of China, to deflect blame away from Trump's ineptitude in handling the crisis! The alt-right and ethno-nationalist movements are going to be inundated with new applications for membership as a result of Trump's racist dog whistle. And all of this is occurring when the number of deaths in the USA has exceeded the US death toll during its invasion of Vietnam, when US lawmakers are cashing in on millions of stock transactions, when school districts across the country are preparing to lay off 300,000 teachers, and when gun-toting Michigan protestors pack into the statehouse, calling for the governor to be hanged because of her stay-at-home law. And let's not forget the stream of vile comments made by politicians who think it's a fair tradeoff to let the elderly and infirm die in order to preserve the economy (don't they realize that the coronavirus also kills children?). Take, for example, comments made by the repugnant Antioch planning commission Chairman Ken Turnage II, who felt compelled to compare the corona virus to a forest fire that burns: old trees, fallen brush and scrub-shrub sucklings' that drain resources, adding that society will 'strengthen' when the pandemic 'is all settled.' 'We would have significant loss of life, we would lose many elderly, that would reduce burdens in our defunct Social Security System, health care cost (once the wave subsided), make jobs available for others and it would also free up housing in which we are in dire need of,' Turnage wrote in the post that has since been deleted. 'We would lose a large portion of the people with immune and other health complications. I know it would be loved ones as well. But that would once again reduce our impact on medical, jobs, and housing.' (Prieve 2020) These comments made all the more chilling as they appear delivered in a dispassionate, pragmatic, and businesslike manner, echo Aktion T4, the program for involuntary euthanasia in Nazi Germany, a project of mass murder that took the lives of approximately 300,000 people between 1939 and 1945. The program was based on eugenics theory, racial hygiene, and budgetary concerns. Certain people were selected as Lebensunwertes Leben, 'unworthy of life,' or 'useless eaters' and were killed by lethal injection, gas, or other means. That we have politicians that would so easily condemn America's 'useless eaters' to a suffocating death should serve as a warning that the unthinkable could happen again and this time in a country that brags about its concern for human rights.",

For the good Reverend, spiritual healing supersedes medical safety precautions. He also claims that his services are preventing incidents of domestic violence, suicide, and starvation (Spell in Boggioni 2020b). In fact, Rev. Death Wish Let-Me-Be-Remembered-As-A-Martyr-Spell is advocating religious fanaticism, calling for Christians literally to die from the coronavirus in the name of religious freedom. He proclaimed that those who 'prefer tyranny over freedom do not deserve freedom.' He also said that 'The bible teaches us to be absent from our bodies so we can be present with the Lord. \u2026 So like any revolutionary, or like any zealot, or like any pure religious person, death looks to them like a welcomed friend' (Palma 2020c) .

Kelly Burton, a pastor at Lone Star Baptist Church in Lone Star, Texas, wrote: 'Satan's trying to keep us apart, he's trying to keep us from worshipping together. But we're not going to let him win' (Barone 2020) . Fundamentalist Christians, as a spiritual tribe, frequently rally around the idea that they are being persecuted. Remember how indignant Christian evangelicals felt about being\u00b4persecuted' by the vile, evil, satanic greeting of 'happy holidays' because they felt it was an attack on\u00b4Merry Christmas' and Christianity in general? Fox News played this 'persecution' to the hilt. Trump bragged to a conservative student group, Turning Point USA, that he had given the right to speak the words 'Merry Christmas' back to Americans after it was falsely claimed that the White House's 'National Christmas Tree' was renamed the 'holiday tree' under President Obama. Does anyone remember when, in 2003, France criticized the US plan to invade Iraq and elected officials in the US House of Representatives decided to rename French fries 'freedom fries'? Fortunately, I'm not ancient enough to recall when, during World War I, Sauerkraut was renamed 'liberty cabbage' and German measles became known as 'liberty measles.' If evangelical Christians want to understand religious persecution in a more serious vein, they can certainly find valid examples of the persecution of Christians-where those faithful to their beliefs have been exiled, or tortured, or burned alive at the stake. But the idea that Christians are being persecuted for having to hold their church services online-as most college professors have been required to do with teaching their classes during this pandemic-is stretching the notion of persecution to absurd proportions (McLaren 2020). But this Christian persecution complex does serve a purpose. Evangelical congregations can now identify as martyrs-with those Christians thrown to the lions in ancient Rome by emperor Nero. But, seriously, we are talking here about throwing Christians to their laptops so that they are forced to watch their pastors speak in tongues on their computer screens. How traumatizing is that? Have the faithful forgotten that you can now be healed by touching a TV screen while a church service is in progress? And I'm sure God would not discriminate against computer screens. Just ask evangelical preacher Kenneth Copeland. Haven't these evangelicals heard of cybertemples and churches, and online prayer chapels in networked environments that can be customized to any religious belief system? Yes, be wary of technology but do not be too fearful that watching a church service in lieu of the real thing is the digital equivalent to being a loser. (Is there anything worse in Trumpworld than not winning?) The public release of the Apple iPhone was regarded as the 'Jesus phone' when it first came out in 2007. And then for those with more conservative inclinations, there is the flip-phone, sometimes called the 'kosher phone,' that has no Internet to tempt the user into entering the world of sin-the original model being the LG VX5500, which was released in 2008.",

But of course, all of this drama around putting people at risk of the coronavirus is supposedly for the benefit of the younger generation, who will otherwise die (and according to Trump, many will die of suicide), should the economy collapse. Besides, it's a chance to show that born again Christians are not wimps. Trump has now tacked to the left in so far as stressing the deadly seriousness of the virus yet immediately afterwards he tacked to the right again, by saying that we need to open the country up again for business (some people are questioning if Trump has business ties to the drug hydroxychloroquine or if he's onto something that has escaped the attention of the medical establishment. After all, he's a billionaire, and in his own words, a 'stable genius').",

The whole country needs socialism-and if people cannot see this, then it just shows how powerful a hegemon the media industrial complex is, as it continues to create the 'necessary illusions' that so far have worked effectively in keeping the American people from mounting a popular ground-level challenge to the overall capitalist system. Here the media serve as a self-replicating filibustering mechanism that keeps the public in a state of endless debate over whether or not there are viable alternatives to the current capitalist system, creating a pendulum of inertia at both ends of the argument. It appears that many Christian nationalists formulate the pandemic in a way that metaphysically juxtaposes nature to history, producing a Manichean duality of good versus evil, a social universe overpopulated by metaphysical reflections of a mystified world. They understand the pandemic not as historically mediated by circumstances engendered in a world that is both real and law-governed-i.e., as in the chronic tendency of capitalism toward overproduction-and that can be explained dialectical analysis, but as trapped within a chamber pot history in which the laws of nature remain static, timeless, and stagnant. In this way, the virus can be interpreted as an indication of God's wrath against those who support abortion or who are homosexual and those in the Deep State who are working to undermine Trump and setting up cannibal-pedophile rings underneath dingy strip mall pizza joints.",

Does not the basis of the spiritual reside in the material-in flesh, blood, and brain? I'm not taking a physicalist position here-since I think it is very likely that consciousness exists beyond the material and is mediated, that is, refracted (not reflected) in, along, and through the brain. What I am saying is that evangelicals appear in many cases to have adopted a creed of thought that antiseptically separates the general from the particular and the universal from the specific and conceives of dichotomies (i.e., fact versus value) from an abstract and metaphysical perspective. But binary oppositions-let us say male and female, black and white, and up and down-are not oppositions only in a metaphysical or idealistic sense, but in the real world of scarcity, they exist as 'distinctions' trapped within dependent hierarchies. Capitalism constrains labor, whiteness constrains blackness, maleness constrains femaleness, and so on-via capitalism's institutionalized structures and their normalizing functions attached to racism, sexism, division of labor, judicial system, etc. We must wake up to the fact that we make ourselves (our self and social formation) in accordance with wider laws of nature. And in so doing, we are dependent upon laws of necessity.",

Necessity is absolute only in relation to the needs of society, which are historically specific. We live in a capitalist society, and we necessarily have to sell our labor power for a wage unless we own the means of production. In other words, needs are contextually specific; they are contingent upon the situation at hand (i.e., mode of production, geopolitics, existential challenges). So that contingency and necessity have to be understood dialectically, not as 'either/or' but as 'both/and.' All things are relative to the necessity that produces them. Yet evangelical preachers declaim messianically that humankind is universally born of the spirit and propagate the falsehood that contingent phenomena such as the coronavirus are in reality divine plagues cast upon humankind for the sin of homosexuality, abortion, fornication, political correctness, and multiculturalism. In this way, for evangelicals, faith in the transcendent supernatural power of Jesus must supersede science. Humans are perceived as powerless if they decline to pray to the God of Prosperity. Here science is glibly supplanted by a metaphysical abstraction. But prayer should not be done in the spirit of helplessness. We cannot pray and then abdicate our responsibility for achieving what we are praying for because we are denying the difficult work ahead in saving the country from Covid-19.",

This results in the belief that consciousness is nothing but a consequence of complex arrangement of matter, or an emergent phenomenon of brain activity. 4.

This is not prophecy television gobbledygook speech. I remain committed to an historical materialist analysis of capitalism and still, at the same time, consider it possible that prayer may have some effects that cannot be explained by traditional paradigms of science (see McLaren and Jandri\u0107 2020b). But during a pandemic, prayer should not be a substitute for medical research. And prayer circles cannot replace medical treatment. And religious bullshit cannot take the place of rational adjudication and dialectical reasoning. Paula, Jerry, and Franklin, are you listening? You might want to order some books on liberation theology or join a Paulo Freire or Thomas Merton reading group. I'm sure they will encourage you to pull up a chair. Attend a Sunday service by Dr. William J. Barber, II, co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign. You can still accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior without at the same time blaming the filthy commies from waging a war against Christianity through their advocacy of multiculturalism, feminism, LGBTQ rights, bilingual education, and democratic socialism. Well, the list goes on. Liberation theology advocates a preferential option for the poor and its exponents and practitioners have stood beside peasant resistance movements in Latin America, even as US trained and sponsored death squads of the Salvadorean military and police forces assassinated many of their leaders, including six Jesuits, their housekeeper, and her daughter in 1979 in their residence on the campus of the Jesuit Central American University (UCA) in San Salvador, El Salvador. The death squads also participated in the assassination of Archbishop \u00d3scar Arnulfo Romero, the 'voice of those without voice,' who was gunned down saying mass at Hospital de la Divina Providencia, a Catholic hospital specializing in oncology and care for the terminally ill. Liberation theology has learned from the writings of Karl Marx without abandoning the teachings of Jesus, teachings which condemn differentiating wealth-the egregious reality that some people are rich at the expense of others who are poor. You can learn, too. Check your local library. Better still, visit some base communities in America Latina.",
