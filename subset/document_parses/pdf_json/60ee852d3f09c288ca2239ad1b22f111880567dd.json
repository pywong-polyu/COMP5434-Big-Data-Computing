            "text": "A cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, in late 2019, caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2. Since then, it spread worldwide abruptly, reaching the level of the pandemic as such that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this as a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\", thereafter being officially coined as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Adhikari et al., 2020; Hawryluck et al., 2004; Qiu et al., 2020) . To date, a wealth of research has been performed to understand the disease trajectories including epidemiology, pathogenesis and transmission dynamics, where endeavors are still ongoing to devise therapeutic and preventive interventions Huang et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Rubin and Wessely, 2020) . Despite significant efforts, the scourge of the disease is continuously jeopardizing the lives and livelihoods of millions all over the world with a persistent rise in death tolls. This outbreak has a catastrophic impact on the economy as well as the terror of this pandemic has had a detrimental effect on mental health like other infectious disease outbreaks (Hall et al., 2008; Ho et al., 2020) . The menace of this pandemic is putting a significant psychological impact on individual life where the magnitude of the sufferings has been reported higher among the COVID-19 infected patients (Deng et al., 2021) . These aggravated sufferings among the COVID-19 patients can be attributed to the incessant mental distress owing to the uncertainty of the disease outcome, fear of death and the health complications caused by the viral infection as well. According to the previous literature, the continuous mental distress arising from the fear of death combined with severe anxiety, depression create unfavorable mental health conditions of patients, which is aggravated manifold due to insomnia and physical effects of the disease (Xiang et al., 2020; Zandifar et al., 2020a Zandifar et al., , 2020b .",

As a result, the psychological symptoms are being under-evaluated and under-managed in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, most medical practitioners prioritize physical conditions while mental health is crucial in intensifying patients' disease outcomes, as evidenced by previous research. The previous study explored that depressed and anxious inpatients were more likely to have poorer outcomes, longer hospital stays, and a higher risk of rehospitalization compared to their counterparts (Dennis et al., 2012) .",

Recent case reports and observational studies have suggested that COVID-19 patients are likely to develop depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances (Fu and Zhang, 2020) . Therefore, to improve the disease outcome, reduce the length of hospital stay, and minimize long-term mental health difficulties, practitioners should properly evaluate and treat these conditions. Despite the importance of treating COVID-19 individuals with poor mental health status, existing research on the mental health impact of COVID-19 among the infected individuals in Bangladesh is inadequate and bleary. Eventually, tailoring an effective intervention model is imperative to mitigate the mental and psychological burden owing to this pandemic situation among the hospitalized COVID-19 infected patients. However, adequate information on psychological impact among the COVID-19 patients is a prerequisite to improvising such an intervention model considering the country's socio-economic and demographic contexts. Therefore, we undertook a cross-sectional study towards assessing the mental and psychological status of the affected COVID-19 patients.",

The total score ranged from 0 to 27, categorized into four groups ranging from minimal (0-4) to severe (20-27) based on their score. In our current study, we took the median cut-off value for depression as !10 Kroenke et al., 2001) . People suffering from moderate to severe depression were prone to develop long-term mental health complications; that is why we used the above cut-off value as 'Depression present'.

Albeit an adjacent country, the prevalence of depression among the COVID-19 patients in India was found two times lower (Kumar et al., 2021) . Study findings also indicate that 31% of the respondents had anxiety symptoms into variable severities. The earlier studies performed in Iran (29%) and Italy (33%) reported an almost similar level of anxiety that the COVID-19 patients have experienced enrolled in the current study. However, the anxiety observed among the patients was markedly higher among the Chinese (48%) and Indian (63%) populations. In this study, we have found that about 21% of the hospital admitted patients had moderate to severe levels of insomnia. This rate is also different from that of China (54.1%) , Turkey (13%) (Karada\u015f et al., 2020) and Italy (50%) (Liguori et al., 2020) in the perspective of severity where some of them reported mild to severely insomniac. An essential finding of this current study is that almost half of the interviewed patients' (47%) reported stress symptoms in variable degrees. At the time of the SARS outbreak in 2001, a study in Hong Kong revealed that hospitalized patients had an increased rate of stress and adverse psychological effects (Chua et al., 2004) . It is proven that disease-related isolation is one of the major causes of psychological symptoms among patients (Xiang et al., 2020) .

            "text": "Our study found a significant association between education level and mental health outcomes among our study population. It is found that highly educated individuals had 58-82% lower rates of mental distress than participants with no educational backgrounds. However, discrepancies have been observed in previous studies. A nationwide survey was done in Bangladesh among the general population that depicted higher rates of stress among graduate individuals (Banna et al., 2020), where few studies reported that lower education level was associated with higher stress, anxiety, insomnia and depression (Mazza et al., 2020; Olagoke et al., 2020) . Higher educated people had more access to authentic news sources than illiterate participants. We assumed that a sound knowledge regarding disease transmission, disease manifestation, and disease containment could be the driving factors for lowering depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia among the higher educated people. Our current analysis found that anxiety was significantly higher among the business personnel and those who earned their livings daily. Our study was in line with the previous survey conducted on the Bangladeshi population (Haque et al., 2020) . The garment sector is one of the core components of our national economy. This sector was severely affected due to disruptions of supply chains. National lockdowns across export destinations led to buyers canceling or postponing orders, resulting in factories shut down and unemployment (Hasan, 2020) . Small businesses also faced multiple challenges (e.g., decreased market demand) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many business owners even failed to meet daily costs. The continuation of the pandemic forced a majority of the small businesses to close down, which was the employment of source for 50 million people (Khalil, 2020) . Lack of financial certainty during the national emergency might create tremendous mental pressure Table 5 . Association between the variables and COVID-19 mental health impact among the study participants in multivariable logistic regression analysis. on them, whereas job holders or government employees had the slightest possibility of job discontinuation (Posel et al., 2021) . Due to the pandemic and national lockdown, most of the COVID-19 participants who earned daily failed to secure sufficient income to afford their families. Moreover, the scenario became more complicated after being hospitalized due to COVID-19. All of these were responsible for creating anxiety among them. The participants exposed to the confirmed COVID-19 individual before getting affected were found 43% less likely to have stress than the participants who were not. Our result was in line with the survey performed by Wang C et al. on the Chinese population (Wang et al., 2020a) . As our COVID-19 cases are escalating day by day, the burden of asymptomatic individuals is uprising. Nowadays, it is difficult to prevent the contact of asymptomatic patients roaming around us. The survey jointly conducted by icddr,b, and IEDCR reported that among COVID-19 cases, 82% of patients did not report any COVID-like symptoms (icddrb, 2020) . The abundance of these asymptomatic cases and lack of proper community case detection might be the possible reason for creating more stress among unexposed study participants than exposed ones, who were aware of the possible consequences.",

The cause of these psychiatric disorders is likely to be multifactorial. Lack of contact with families and loved ones during quarantine or hospitalization, age, comorbidities, the concern of family members getting infected, lack of access to social media, and misinformation regarding COVID-19 may facilitate the development of psychiatric disorders in COVID-19 patients. The high prevalence and severity of these psychiatric disorders further emphasize the need to pay more attention to their mental health along with their physical improvement. Further demonstration of suicide and suicidal tendencies of COVID-19 patients prioritized the importance of early detection and intervention to this vulnerable cohort (Akhter, 2021; Bagcchi, 2020; bdnews24.com, 2021; Liu et al., 2020) . The poor mental health status observed among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients necessitates utmost attention from healthcare providers and policymakers to ensure their wellbeing through psychological care and timely intervention. Hospitals should integrate distant psychosocial screening and post-COVID psychiatric counseling through telemedicine and online mental health sessions and develop a system to allow proper communication with these hospitalized patients and their families. Further improvement of health literacy and broadcasting the correct information may also help curb social stigma surrounding COVID-19 patients and eventually upgrade their psychological wellbeing.",
