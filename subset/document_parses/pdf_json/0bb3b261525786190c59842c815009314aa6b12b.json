In this study, we use aggregated mobile phone user data to reconstruct commuter mobility networks for Bangkok (Thailand) and Dhaka (Bangladesh), two megacities in Asia with populations of 16 and 21 million people, respectively. We model the dynamics of directly-transmitted infections (such as SARS-CoV2) propagating on these commuting networks, and find that differences in network structure between the two cities drive divergent predicted epidemic trajectories: the commuting network in Bangkok is composed of geographically-contiguous modular communities and epidemic dispersal is correlated with geographic distance between locations, whereas the network in Dhaka has less distinct geographic structure and epidemic dispersal is less constrained by geographic distance. We also find that the predicted dynamics of epidemics vary depending on the local topology of the network around the origin of the outbreak. Measuring commuter mobility, and understanding how commuting networks shape epidemic dynamics at the city level, can support surveillance and preparedness efforts in large cities at risk for emerging or imported epidemics.",

The distribution and connectivity of human populations within cities plays a key role in spreading outbreaks when they occur, but the factors determining how the vulnerabilities translate into epidemic dynamics are still unclear, and this has important implications for surveillance and preparedness. Local SARS-CoV-2 epidemics have thus far exhibited substantial diversity in their scale and trajectory between cities [2] , for example, and the factors behind differential city-level risk of epidemic propagation (for both SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging or endemic pathogens) are still incompletely understood [3, 4] . Likewise, our ability to predict the spatial distribution of disease activity within cities during epidemics (for example, by neighborhood or hospital catchment area) is constrained by lack of informative data, including geolocated or spatially-resolved epidemiological data and reliable data on human movement in cities. Improved strategies are needed for a priori stratification of epidemic risk in large cities, including strategies that can estimate epidemic potential at the city level and identify local determinants of epidemic risk within cities.",

These two cities capture some of the substantial diversity in population density, spatial organization, transportation networks, and socioeconomic conditions observed across \"megacities\" (typically defined as cities and associated urban agglomerations with > 10 million total residents), and are thus well-suited for studying differences in epidemic dynamics between large cities. We find important differences between commuter mobility networks and predicted spatiotemporal trajectories of epidemics in each city. We report metrics on spatial distribution of population density in megacities, including Dhaka and Bangkok, to contextualize these findings. Our results support the use of mobile phone user data for evaluating city-level susceptibility to emerging or imported epidemics and for identifying locations within cities where local topology of the commuter network is expected to facilitate epidemic propagation.",

The DSMA is composed of Dhaka and several surrounding administrative units covering 1353 km 2 with an estimated population of approximately 21 million (15521 persons/km 2 ). We collected CDR data over 81 consecutive days (1 August to 19 October, 2017 in Bangkok, and 1 April to 21 June 2017 in Dhaka), restricted to the mobile network towers within each administrative region (BMR or DSMA), and excluded major national and religious holidays. We aggregated data over 500 m x 500 m grid squares and used squares with at least one mobile phone tower in service during the data collection period to define the set of nodes L = {L1, L2, . . . , Li} in the commuting network.

Analysis using M wke OD is motivated by the assumption that the most visited location on weekend days is likely to represent a user's home location, and the most visited location during the first day of the work week is likely to be a user's work location, such that M wke OD is expected to capture commuter mobility between home and work locations. M all OD captures movement between frequently-visited locations and, although there is no expectation that these are either home or work locations, provides a proxy measurement for aggregate daily human movements between locations within each city. Entries T weighted j,k in M all OD are calculated using all 81 available origin days in the data collection period and 8 observed weekend-weekday transitions in the data collection period for M all OD . M all OD and M wke OD are highly similar to one another (Mantel test p < 0.005) and the mobility networks estimated from the two matrices share are very similar with respect to network community structure and centrality measures (Supplemental Figures S2-S5) , i.e. we observe the same overall mobility patterns between the two methods of estimating mobility flux. We use M all OD for the primary analyses that follow, given the large number of days in this data collection period, which is expected to provide more informative data compared to M wke OD , which is derived from a much smaller number of observations.

Epidemic propagation is less synchronized in Bangkok and nodes located in the peripheral areas of the BMR, specifically in the west and northeast, exhibit delayed epidemic peaks compared to nodes in central Bangkok or the western BMR ( Figures 4C & 4D) . These results are consistent across a wide range of modeling parameters and are observed regardless of how the origin node for each simulation is chosen (either from a uniform distribution or population-weighted multinomial distribution, Figure S8 ). Simulated epidemics initialized on the Bangkok commuting network exhibit distinct wave-like dispersal away from an epidemic origin ( Figure 5B ). Early in the simulated epidemics, the number of infected individuals in a given node is negatively correlated with geographic distance from the origin node. This correlation becomes less distinct and later reverses and becomes positive as the wave of epidemic dispersal moves outward from the epidemic origin. Simulated epidemics on the Dhaka commuter network do not exhibit any wave-like features and, unlike Bangkok, propagation of the epidemic is largely unconstrained by distance ( Figure 5A ) at all time points. These features are observed regardless of how origin nodes are selected (either from a population-weighted multinomial distribution or a uniform distribution, Figure S9 ), and are also observed if the mobility network is specified by M wke OD rather than 5 .

In simulated epidemics propagating on the Bangkok commuter network, epidemic speed (measured as the time to peak number of infections in the entire network) differs depending on the eigenvector centrality of the origin node ( Figure 6 ): specifically, simulated epidemics originating at nodes with lower eigenvector centrality values are slower, with later epidemic peak times, compared to those originating at nodes with high eigenvector centrality (mean time to epidemic peak,t peak = 198 and 222 days for nodes with eigenvector centrality values in the tenth and first deciles, respectively). For simulated epidemics initialized on the Dhaka commuter network, we observe a smaller difference in time to epidemic peak between simulations seeded at nodes with low versus high eigenvector centrality values (t peak = 197 and 203 days). Maximum epidemic size, i.e. the estimated number of infected individuals at the epidemic peak, also varies by eigenvector centrality of the origin node with smaller differences observed in Dhaka compared to Bangkok ( Figure S13 ). The degree, strength, and eigenvector centrality of the origin node are more strongly correlated with mean epidemic arrival time (time to first infection in a given node, averaged over all nodes in the network) in Bangkok compared to Dhaka (Supplemental Figure S6 ). Geographic distance and effective network distance (a measure of mobility-based connectivity between nodes) from the origin node are positively correlated with epidemic arrival time in Bangkok (Supplemental Figure S14 ); in Dhaka, epidemic arrival time is positively correlated with effective network distance, but is less consistently correlated with geographic distance. In both Dhaka and Bangkok, for epidemics simulated with a wide range of model parameters and seeded at random nodes across each network, epidemic arrival time is negatively correlated with eigenvector centrality of non-origin nodes (Supplemental Figure S14 ).",

Communities in Dhaka are distinctly non-contiguous, suggesting movement within the DMSA is less local and not constrained by geography. Strong geographic contiguity within communities is observed in the BMR data even after restricting our analysis to a small area in central Bangkok, indicating that the geographically disorganized network communities observed in Dhaka are likely not an artifact of unmeasured connectivity with unobserved nodes outside the DMSA study area (Supplemental Information).",

These differences are robust over different spatial scales in each city ( Figures 4B & 4D) , indicating that the synchronized epidemics in Dhaka are not simply an artifact of the relatively smaller geographic size of the DMSA. This is an important alternative explanation to consider. Given a sufficiently large catchment area around the DMSA, we would expect to see delayed epidemic peaks at outlying or weakly connected locations; indeed, using our modeling approach, this would be an expected result for simulated epidemics propagated on any mobility network in which certain nodes have weaker connectivity to the network as whole (due to distance or other factors). Still, the observations in this study have potentially important implications for public health decision-making in the BMR and DMSA. Specifically, for Dhaka, these results may suggest that resources for testing and case detection (for example, PCR-based testing for SARS-CoV2) should be deployed as early and widely as possible during an epidemic, and that geographically-restricted testing (for example, at assumed transmission \"hot spots\") could result in large numbers of infections going undetected.",

Estimating mobility from mobile phone user data requires the use of multiple simplifying assumptions, some that are inherent to all estimates made from this kind of data, some that are essential to protect the privacy of mobile data users, and some that are specific to our study. Most important, we assume that two locations, (1) the node where a user places the majority of calls during one 24-hour period and (2) the node where the same user places the majority of calls during the subsequent 24-hour period, represent the origin and terminus of a single trip by one user. This assumption has potential shortcomings and the resulting origin-destination matrix may not fully capture daily movement. Numerous alternative approaches for estimating daily commuter movement from CDR data have been proposed and examined (for example, [22, 23, 24] ) but as yet there is no consensus on which of these approaches provides the most appropriate informative data for modeling epidemic dynamics. How origin-destination matrices derived from CDR data compare with census-derived estimates [25] , and how the use of these data sources influences models of epidemic dynamics [19, 26] , are important research questions. We also note that the entries in M wke OD and M all OD are scaled using estimated population data from the WorldPop project, and that these estimates have important sources of bias and variance as well [11] . We also acknowledge that mobility patterns in cities are dynamic and that analyses based on data aggregated over discrete time periods may not fully capture variability in mobility patterns over time. Likewise, population distributions and city structure may change rapidly in megacities and mobility data collected in these environments may become outdated relatively quickly. Lastly, by considering only trips between locations within the BMR and DSMA, we do not account for connectivity between these areas and more distant or outlying locations; connectivity with areas outside the BMR and DSMA is expected to not only drive epidemic dispersal into surrounding locations but also influence spatiotemporal epidemic dynamics within the central urban areas.",

Additional studies, comparing directly observed person-person interactions (for example, via Bluetooth handshake [27] or RFID sensors [28] ) to mobility trajectories estimated from CDR and other passively-collected mobile data sources, are needed to better understand the limits of CDR-based mobility estimates in this context.

We excluded two time periods from the dataset (12-13 August and 13-15 October) corresponding to two major national holidays during which total subscriber counts transiently decreased, leaving a total of 81 days in the dataset. In Dhaka Statistical Metropolitan Area, CDR data was collected from 1560 network towers. The entire data collection period in Dhaka spans 183 days from 1 April to 30 September 2017. The total number of subscribers in the Dhaka dataset increased from 22.6 million to 31.5 million during this data collection period. To minimize any potential bias introduced by this increase, and to match the duration of the data collection period of the Bangkok dataset, we used only the first 81 days of data in Dhaka dataset. Three towers in Dhaka exhibited unusual daily subscriber counts (which progressively increased during the study period) were omitted from analysis. We also identified a small number of towers (< 1% in both cities) that appear to have been activated during the data collection period. Specifically, these towers were found to have zero total subscribers until a discrete day, and from that point forward had large, non-zero subscriber numbers. We calculated the mean number of trips originating from these specific towers using only on the non-zero, post-activation days in each dataset.",

Mantel testing, performed using the untransformed origin-destination matrices as \"similarility\" rather than \"distance\" matrices, indicated statistically significant correlation between between M all OD and M wke OD for Dhaka and Bangkok (p < 0.005 for all comparisons with n=1000 permutations). Community structures estimated using either M all OD or M wke OD are broadly similar: similarity and dissimilarity metrics (including normalized mutual information, Rand Index, and variation of information) for community structures estimated using the two different origin-destination matrices are similar those estimated for multiple Infomap estimates using the same origin-destination matrix, i.e. the magnitude variation between community structures estimated M all OD or M wke OD is similar to the variation inherent to all Infomap-based estimates of community structure (Figures S2 & S3) . The geospatial and statistical distribution of eigenvector centrality values estimated from M all OD and M wke OD are broadly similar (Figures S4 & S5) . Lastly, we evaluate whether the observed differences in estimated community structures between Dhaka and Bangkok could be attributable to unmeasured connectivity between nodes within city-level commuting networks and unobserved nodes outside each data catchment area (i.e. the BMR and DMSA shown in Figure 2 A) . Specifically, to examine whether the geographically-unconstrained communities observed in Dhaka result from connectivity with unobserved nodes outside the DMSA, we test whether the geographic contiguity of the Bangkok community structure is lost if increasing numbers of nodes are excluded from the origin-destination matrix, effectively creating an increasing number of unobserved nodes. Estimated community structures in Bangkok retain strong geographic contiguity (measured as the proportion of a node's immediately adjacent neighbors that belong to the same community and reported as the average of this value for all nodes) even when the network is restricted to nodes within 15 km of the city center ( Figure S7 ).",
