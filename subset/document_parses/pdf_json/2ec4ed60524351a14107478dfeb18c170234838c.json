Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is a proven mean for disinfection and sterilization and has been integrated into handheld devices and autonomous mobile robots. Existing UVGI robots which are commonly equipped with uncovered lamps that emit intense ultraviolet radiation suffer from: inability to be used in human presence, shadowing of objects, and long disinfection time. These robots also have a high operational cost. This paper introduces a cost effective germicidal system that utilizes UVGI to disinfect pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, on high contact surfaces (e.g. doors and tables). This system is composed of a team of 5-DOF mobile manipulators with end-effectors that are equipped with far-UVC excimer lamps. The design of the system is discussed with emphasis on path planning, coverage planning, and scene understanding. Evaluations of the UVGI system using simulations and irradiance models are also included. Please see the project's website for videos and simulations of the robot. 1",

These devices have been around from before the COVID-19 pandemic and were primarily developed to mitigate the spread of Hospital acquired infections (HAIs). Most devices are essentially uncovered UV lamps mounted on top of a manually operated or a robotic mobile base. There are two main challenges associated with these devices. Firstly, UV exposure to humans could potentially lead to varying degrees of erythema, photoaging, skin cancer, and vision loss [4, 5] ; therefore, these robots are only applicable when there is no human present. Another issue is the high operating cost of these devices. They typically use an array of high-powered UV lamps which result in high energy consumption.",

Our robot also uses far-UVC which has been proven to be safe for human skin. This enables our robots to operate in human presence. \u2022 3) Improved Disinfection Range: By using a manipulator for UV disinfection, high-touch surfaces (e.g. door knobs, table tops, and light switches) can be disinfected more effectively than existing robots/devices. Areas that are cluttered and shadowed are also able to be reached more easily with the improved range of motion. \u2022 4) Cost Efficiency: The design of our robot is modular and is based on low-cost open-source robotic platforms. In addition, the UV lights used have lower energy consumption leading to a system with less initial and operating cost. \u2022 5) Resource Management: Since our robot can be used alongside humans, it does not prevent the use of spaces being disinfected, such as patient rooms, labs, hallways etc. The safeness of far-UVC lamps also eliminates the need for additional oversight by staff. \u2022 6) Applications: The proposed system can be deployed in various environments, including care facilities, clin-ics, animal farms, and schools. This paper is organized as follows: Section II presents a summary of commercially available UV devices/robots and the ongoing research. Section III presents the hardware overview of our design, and Section IV presents the autonomy stack of the robot. The experiments are presented in Section V.

There is a rising interest in the use of area disinfection portable UV devices and robots. Portable UV devices typically consist of high power pulsed xenon lamps or an array of low pressure mercury lamps, and motion detectors [7] . The irradiance envelope of these lamps can disinfect a volume of space in all directions. These are used as a supplement to disinfection procedures in health care settings. Due to adverse effects of UV to human skin, these devices are used in empty rooms. The exposure to humans is further limited by covering of exposed windows. The motion-detection sensors also pause UV light emission when humans are detected. Most of these devices are placed and maneuvered manually around set locations within a room by human operators [7] .",

This is a major limiting factor for institutions, like hospitals, where there is a high demand of rooms due to constant influx of patients. Staff also has to ensure that there is no one present in the room and all the windows of that room are covered to prevent potential UV exposure. In addition, many high touch surfaces might not get disinfected properly due to occlusion by other objects and shadows. Due to increasing demand in cleaning and disinfecting, several works are underway to seek improvements in germicidal and sanitation technologies, including UV robots. The use of manipulators for UV disinfection was proposed in [16] . This would enable sufficient disinfection of hard to reach surfaces. McGinn et al. [17] used a novel design to shield the radiation envelope of UV robots so that it could be used along with humans. Similarly, a prototype of autonomous UV disinfection robot with improvements in mechanical and electrical design was developed in [18] .",

This module is primarily responsible for navigating the robot towards all detected target surfaces based on the trajectories produced on previously built map. \u2022 Manipulator Path Planning: This module generates the joint paths for the 5DOF robotic manipulator along the target surface. The MoveIt framework is utilized for motion planning of the manipulator [29] . The framework combines planning scene generation, a path planning pipeline, and trajectoryexecution manager into a centralized movegroup ROS node. With representation of the world and the current jointstate of the manipulator determined by MoveIt, motion planning requests with required constraints can be made. Sampling path planning algorithms from the integrated motion planning library, Open Motion Planning Library(OMPL), are then used to formulate valid manipulator trajectories within MoveIt. The inverse kinematic solver of MoveIt is used to determine the joint angles to reach the desired location on the target surfaces during Cartesian space planning. These joint angle trajectories are converted into commands for simulated/real actuators using a PID control loop feedback mechanism from the ROS Control package [30] . The UV robot simply moves along the straight line. Both robots are able to generate sufficient dosage required to inactivate harmful antibiotic resistant microorganisms, such as C.Diff and MRSE. The UV robot provides a much stronger dose because of high-powered lamps, but this comes at the cost of increased power consumption.

Firstly, the bi-objective optimization problem is converted into a single objective using the convex combination of the two objectives. Then, N different networks are trained, each with different scalarizing factors, to approximate the Pareto front. We use DRL-MOA networks for our application.

For typical UV Robots, we assume that the robot is at a distance of 1 m from the target surface. \u2022 Dosage Map: Each robot moves along a certain trajectory, highlighted in dosage plots in Fig 3 during the disinfection operation. The dosage map is computed by aggregating the dosage received by each point on the target surface from various positions and configurations of the robot. The dosage is calculated based on eq-(1). The dosage maps for G-robot and UV Robot are given in Fig. 3 . Key data is summarized in Table 1 . Both UV robot and G-robot generate the sufficient dosage required to inactivate harmful antibiotic resistant microorganisms, such as MRSA and C.Diff. It is clear that UV robot generates much higher average dosage as compared to G-robot; however, this comes at an increased cost of operation. From Table 1 , it can be seen that G-robot provides a much higher Dosage Per Unit energy consumption (DPU). This is because G-robot disinfects from a very close distance, and higher dosage is achieved at lower energy consumption as a result. On the contrary, UV robots use high-powered lamps which provide strong doses at an increased energy consumption. The major drawback of UV-robots is that with such strong intensities of UVC, they cannot be utilized in applications involving human presence. G-robot avoids these issues through a low powered light source and a design that enables and allows for operating alongside human presence. In addition, G-robot's manipulator allows for disinfection of shadowed areas and tight spaces that cannot be reached by a conventional UV disinfection robot. ",

This further validates that our system can be deployed in real world situations to disinfect high touch surfaces. As briefly discussed in Section III.B, the inherent nature of our design and incorporation of the Ushio 12W Care222 far-UVC emitter, prevents detrimental effects on human skin and eyes. Our system can therefore be used alongside humans and is capable of providing disinfection around the clock.

Our robot has many advantages over commercially available UVC robots, including its ability to be used in human presence, and its improved disinfection effectiveness for cluttered and shadowed spaces. Hence, G-robot can be deployed in hospitals to limit the spread of infectious diseases. Our future work will be focused on evaluating the effectiveness of G-robot in clinical settings. We also plan to use pixel level classification or semantic bounding boxes to further enhance the scene understanding. This would enable us to identify and generate paths for more complex surfaces in the environment. Finally, a multi-robot system that facilitate collaboration of multiple G-robots for disinfection is also being explored.",
