First, the risk to postoperative thoracic patients is significant: mortality of 20% to 40% has been reported in small case series. 1, 2 Second, the potential for aerosolization during surgery and viral transmission to the operating team has been acknowledged. 3 Although there are currently no data on intraoperative SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it is known to have similar stability and viability to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 in aerosols 4 ; other viruses are known to transmit through surgical smoke and aerosols 5, 6 ; and there is a high incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in operators exposed to the airways. 7 Although many countries, including our own, have placed a temporary suspension on elective procedures, emergent/urgent thoracic patients will continue to require surgery, and relaxations of elective surgery suspensions will need to occur in the near future. We share here how we have modified our operative technique to minimize the operating team exposure to aerosols during thoracic surgery (Table 1) .

The evacuated gases pass through a tubeset containing an ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) filter, which captures and removes 99.999% of particulates and micro-organisms >0.1 mm. 14 The Pneumo-Clear system also prevents overpressurizing the thoracic cavity through a venting valve, which passes through a high-efficiency particulate air (ie, HEPA) filter that captures 99.97% of particles>0.3 mm. 14 Coronavirus particles range from 60 to 140 nm in diameter 15 and are generally dispersed in larger droplets, and thus should be effectively removed; however, this has not been directly tested yet. Figure 1 depicts the setup for this system. Four ports are created for the robotic system (Da Vinci Xi; Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, Calif). Small skin incisions are used when inserting the trocars and a low insufflation pressure is used to minimize leak around the ports. CO 2 insufflation is connected to 1 port, whereas smoke evacuation and desufflation are connected to the remaining 3 ports. A circulating nurse controls the PneumoClear system and triggers desufflation; generally, additional staff in the operating room are not required.",

CO 2 insufflation is connected to 1 port (clear tubing) and smoke evacuation/desufflation is connected to the remaining 3 ports (purple tubing connected to a white 3-way splitter). During the operation, CO 2 is insufflated while smoke and aerosols are continuously evacuated from the chest. Before all instrument changes and specimen removal, the desufflation function is used to evacuate the gas within the thoracic cavity. VIDEO 1. A pulmonary segmentectomy using a standard 4-port roboticassisted approach is shown. The PneumoClear system (Stryker) is connected to the ports (the system screen is pictured in the bottom right). Before any instrument change is made, the thoracic cavity is desufflated. A simple method is also used to minimize instrument changes for lymph node sampling. After desufflation, the instrument is removed, a green sterile glove with numbered fingers is introduced into chest, the instrument reinserted, and CO 2 insufflation and smoke evacuation recommenced. Lymph nodes that have been resected are placed into the numbered fingers of the glove. Once the lung specimen is ready to be removed, the glove is placed in the endocatch bag with the lung and removed at the same time. The surgeon removes the lymph nodes from the glove and inspects the thoracic cavity before closing to make sure all material has been removed.
