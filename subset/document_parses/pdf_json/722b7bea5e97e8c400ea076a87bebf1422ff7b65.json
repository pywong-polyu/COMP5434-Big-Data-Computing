Definitive studies have shown that colorectal cancer screening is valuable and has improved outcomes in the average-risk population [1] . Current American College of Physicians best practice guidelines advise screening adults with average risk beginning at age 50. However, screening age varies based on individual risk and is best determined by shared decision-making between patients and providers. Routinely, patients 50 years or older with average risk make up 38% of all colonoscopy procedures [2] . If colonic lesions are identified early and removed during colonoscopy, the risk of developing colorectal cancer is decreased by up to 90 percent [3] . Clinical practice guidelines asserted by multiple organizations agree that screening followed up by treatment is successful in decreasing incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer [3, 4] .",

According to a review of electronic medical records in the United States during the pandemic, the average number of weekly colonoscopy screenings has decreased by 86% [12] . If this reduction in screening continues, estimates predict that there could be a precipitous drop in cancer diagnoses, leading to later initiation of treatment and worse outcomes [11] . One study showed that up to 29% of patients were nonpresenters to endoscopy procedures, and of those that presented for symptom indicated endoscopies, there was a positive pathological diagnosis rate of 48.7% and a cancer diagnosis rate of 5.9% [10] . A classic representation of this delay is a case study that showed a patient with low-grade dysplasia on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) who delayed two subsequent repeat EGD's due to COVID-19 related concerns. This patient reluctantly agreed to repeat EGD three months later and was found to have intramucosal cancer in the background of high-grade dysplasia [9] . In contrast, other studies have shown that patient willingness to undergo elective endoscopy is quite high, with rates as high as 75% and only 4% unwilling and 21% unsure [13] .",

Additionally, there were questions about patient compliance regarding medication use, healthcare appointments, routine colonoscopies, symptom indicated colonoscopies, and visits to the emergency department. Patients who refused, rescheduled, or missed a colonoscopy were asked the reason why they missed and their plans to reschedule.

In this cohort, only six (5.8%) respondents were advised to undergo a symptom indicated colonoscopy, of which one (16.7%) refused, rescheduled, or missed for fear of contracting COVID-19. When asked if the patient would hypothetically undergo a routine colonoscopy, most patients (63.1%) said \"yes,\" while a larger percentage (76.7%) of patients would agree to a symptom-indicated colonoscopy. In this study, 36.9% and 23.3% of patients said \"no or unsure\" to undergoing a hypothetical routine colonoscopy and a symptom indicated colonoscopy, respectively. In subgroup analysis, females had lower rates of willingness to undergo a routine colonoscopy and symptom indicated colonoscopy at 54.4% and 69.1%, respectively, when compared to their male counterparts at 80% and 91.4% (see Figure 1 and Figure 2 ).

In one meta-analysis, the prevalence of stress was 29.6%, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression was 31.9% [22] . Individual risk factors such as preexisting mental health conditions, chronic health issues, and social restriction and isolation add to the psychological impact of the global pandemic. We believe that these adverse psychological responses to the stressors of the global pandemic have contributed to patient non-presentation at appointments. Our study also shows that a larger number of females were unwilling or unsure about undergoing a routine colonoscopy when compared to their male counterparts. This is in concordance with studies showing that the female gender is strongly associated with more negative impacts due to COVID-19 stressors [19] .",

Among those who thought they might need emergency care, 23.1% did not seek this care due to fear of accessing healthcare resources in the setting of the pandemic. However, contrary to a prior study indicating that many patients were no longer taking medications as directed, our patient population reported a high rate of compliance with prescribed medications [18] . Prior to the pandemic, chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, were linked to higher rates of psychological distress when compared to the general population [19] . With well-documented increases in the severity of COVID-19 disease progression with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, it is evident that concern over contracting the virus is enough to dissuade those with underlying health issues from attending routine appointments [23] . These findings are consistent with previous data that shows patient visits to clinics during the pandemic have decreased by 76% in asymptomatic patients and 73% in patients with chronic conditions [10] .",

While not directly measured in this study, our respondent population was recruited from an area where household income and academic metrics consistently trail national averages [24, 25] .
