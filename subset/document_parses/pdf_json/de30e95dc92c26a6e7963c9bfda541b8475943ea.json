            "text": "Speech understanding in noise is poorer in bilateral cochlear-implant (BICI) users compared to normal-hearing counterparts. Independent automatic gain controls (AGCs) may contribute to this because adjusting processor gain independently can reduce interaural level differences that BICI listeners rely on for bilateral benefits. Bilaterally linked AGCs may improve bilateral benefits by increasing the magnitude of interaural level differences. The effects of linked AGCs on bilateral benefits (summation, head shadow, and squelch) were measured in nine BICI users. Speech understanding for a target talker at 0 masked by a single talker at 0 , 90 , or \u00c090 azimuth was assessed under headphones with sentences at five target-tomasker ratios. Research processors were used to manipulate AGC type (independent or linked) and test ear (left, right, or both). Sentence recall was measured in quiet to quantify individual interaural asymmetry in functional performance. The results showed that AGC type did not significantly change performance or bilateral benefits. Interaural functional asymmetries, however, interacted with ear such that greater summation and squelch benefit occurred when there was larger functional asymmetry, and interacted with interferer location such that smaller head shadow benefit occurred when there was larger functional asymmetry. The larger benefits for those with larger asymmetry were driven by improvements from adding a better-performing ear, rather than a true binaural-hearing benefit. In summary, linked AGCs did not significantly change bilateral benefits in cases of speech-on-speech masking with a single-talker masker, but there was also no strong detriment across a range of target-to-masker ratios, within a small and diverse BICI listener population.",

            "text": "One of the most pervasive problems for individuals with hearing loss is difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise and competing talkers (Hallberg et al., 2008) . In complex listening situations, such as restaurants and cocktail parties, normal-hearing listeners use cues from sound sources emanating from different locations to derive spatial-hearing benefits (Cherry, 1953; Hawley et al., 1999; Ibrahim et al., 2013) . When listening with two ears, these benefits include summation, head shadow, and squelch (Culling & Lavandier, 2021; Dieudonn e & Francart, 2019) . Summation (sometimes called redundancy) is the performance benefit with a second ear because redundant and/ or complimentary speech information is present in both ears (Culling & Lavandier, 2021 ; Dieudonn e & Francart, Squelch is the performance benefit of listening with two ears that is independent of changes in TMR (Culling & Lavandier, 2021; Dieudonn e & Francart, 2019) , thought to be from an improved internal TMR (Lecl ere et al., 2015) by calculating interaural timing and level differences (ITDs and ILDs, respectively). These different benefits combine to provide spatial release from masking (SRM), the improvement in understanding a target talker when there is spatial separation between a target and masker (Dieudonn e & Francart, 2019) .",

The magnitude of these benefits can be compared between BICI and normal-hearing listeners, but the stimuli, procedures, and calculations used affect the size of the benefits measured (Dieudonn e & Francart, 2019), making similarly designed studies the fairest comparisons. For summation, a benefit of about 1 to 2 dB is observed for both BICI (Schleich et al., 2004) and normal-hearing listeners (Bronkhorst & Plomp, 1988; Cox et al., 1981) . For head shadow, similarly designed studies have found about 3 to 7 dB of benefit for BICI (Schleich et al., 2004) and normal-hearing listeners (Dubno et al., 2008) . For squelch, similarly designed studies have found no benefit for BICI (Loizou et al., 2009 ) and 6 dB for normal-hearing listeners (Hawley et al., 2004) . These values illustrate the disparity between these two groups in accessing squelch. Therefore, it is important to establish what contributes to this difference in performance with the overall goal of learning how to reduce this gap.",

For bilateral hearing-assistive device users (both hearing aids and BICIs), AGCs have historically been applied to each device independently. Independent AGCs in hearing aids can have relatively small effects on localization and SRM since these listeners often have access to low-frequency fine-structure ITDs (e.g., Keidser et al., 2006) . Preserving ILDs could be especially important for BICI listeners, as they are unable to access low-frequency fine-structure ITD cues and instead rely heavily on ILDs (Aronoff et al., 2010; Churchill et al., 2014; Kan et al., 2015; Laback et al., 2015; Seeber & Fastl, 2008) .

Normal-hearing listeners presented with acoustic simulations of hearing-assistive devices have shown significant increases in speech understanding with linked AGCs, particularly when there was greater spatial separation between target and masker (Archer-Boyd & Carlyon, 2019; Schwartz & Shinn-Cunningham, 2013; Spencer et al., 2019; Wiggins & Seeber, 2011 . For example, normal-hearing listeners presented with vocoder simulations of head-shadow benefit performed significantly better with linked AGCs compared with independent AGCs (Spencer et al., 2019) . In BICI listeners, linked AGCs provided a significant improvement compared to independent AGCs in continuous and intermittent multi-talker babble with target speech from near the front at \u00fe10 azimuth and the masker from the left at -70 azimuth (Potts et al., 2019) . The speech reception threshold (SRT), the TMR associated with 50% correct, improved by about 2.5 dB with linked AGCs. Previous studies did not examine the components of SRM independently in BICI listeners. Therefore, the linked AGC benefit for head shadow and squelch is currently unknown.",

When the TMR is negative, the interferer on the side will be the primary driver of the AGC. In this situation, linked AGCs would have the largest potential to improve ILDs.

In addition to preventing over-stimulation, linked AGCs also aim to preserve the ILD, meaning that one ear will need to be more intense than the other for a source away from the midline. This could be achieved by making the ipsilateral ear more intense, the contralateral ear less intense, or a combination of the two. Making the ipsilateral ear more intense (less gain reduction than indicated by an independent AGC) could potentially result in over-stimulation, whereas making the contralateral ear less intense (more gain reduction than indicated by an independent AGC) would naturally result in a reduction of the stimulation level of that ear. A conservative approach to avoid over-stimulation is to apply the higher gain reduction of the two independent AGCs to both ears, but this approach of more aggressive compression could result in a decrement in speech understanding. In other words, there might be a tradeoff between bilateral benefit and monaural dynamic range reduction with this approach. Listeners may be differentially impacted depending on the degree to which they rely on each of their ears individually for this task. When functional speech understanding abilities are symmetrical, listeners have the opportunity to rely on the ear which is closer to the target. In cases of asymmetrical profiles, if the sound source is located contralateral to the functionally better ear, they may experience a decline in speech understanding as a result of reduced signal level at the functionally better ear.",

In that study, open-set sentence (Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineering [IEEE]; Rothauser et al., 1969) scores in quiet were used as a baseline and closed-set sentence (coordinate response measure [CRM]; Bolia et al., 2000; Brungart et al., 2001) scores were used to assess binaural benefits in situations of speech-on-speech masking. They measured squelch without head-shadow effects by comparing speech understanding when the target and interferer were presented to one ear compared to when the interferer was presented to both ears. The information in the contralateral ear often resulted in interference, with worse performance in binaural compared to monaural conditions. SRM was also measured and was smaller than typically reported values in the BICI population. Their interpretation of the data was that the negative squelch values diminished the overall SRM when combined with the head-shadow benefit.",

More symmetrical listeners and those with better speech understanding scores, with often younger ages of implantation and durations of deafness, showed greater access to squelch on this same task, suggesting that benefits from squelch are indeed attainable . This result is particularly important to the use of AGCs in asymmetrical listeners since access to these binaural benefits is critical to maximizing potential benefit from linking these controls.

For pink noise, the slow-loop threshold is approximately 62 dB SPL. For speech or speech-shaped noise, the threshold varies depending on the particular spectrum characteristics and can range from 62 to 67 dB SPL. The activation threshold of the AGC depends also, in part, on how quickly the amplitude rises in the input signal. Rapid changes in input level result in activating the fast-loop onset of the AGC (with threshold at 8 dB above the slow-loop threshold) to maintain protection from loudness discomfort. This fast-acting onset AGC works on stimuli at a syllabic/word level and therefore any effects of this being activated should be reflected in the performance of listeners presented with speech stimuli.",

In parallel, the attenuated signals were summed without the application of the HRTFs and a scaling factor was determined to maintain an overall 75 dB SPL stimulus presentation for the summed signal. The nominal level of the mixed talkers was fixed at 75 dB SPL so that individuals were tested at a level above the AGC activation threshold. Given AGC activation could occur at levels higher or lower than the approximate values, the signal level of 75 dB SPL was selected to ensure that the threshold was exceeded for the spectrally varying speech stimuli. In addition, this signal level was also consistent with that used in other studies testing effects of AGCs (e.g., Potts et al., 2019; Spencer et al., 2019) . The scaling factor was then applied to the HRTF-applied signals after the target and interferers were summed. This signal processing approach was used to be congruent with how the levels would be chosen if the experiment was performed in the sound field; the stimuli were scaled to the calibrated value without influence of attenuation from the head.",

The third and fourth program combinations were included for use during the monaural testing conditions, with the muted ear AGC linked to the test ear in program combination (4).

After the processors were programmed, the listeners were allotted a 15-minute period to listen to the device settings to ensure comfort and to allow for acclimatization. This was considered adequate time as studies investigating the effect of acclimatization time on SRM with hearing technology have shown no significant changes in binaural cues with increased adjustment periods (Dawes et al., 2013) .

The maximal model included fixed effects and their interactions, all random intercepts and slopes for every fixed effect of interest (excluding asymmetry) for listeners, and all random intercepts and slopes for every fixed effect of interest for target sentence (color-number pairs). All fixed effects were categorical with the exception of asymmetry. The buildmer algorithm took the input from the maximal model and ordered the random-effects by systematically reducing complexity and then reduced the fixed-effects structure until a model that converged and best explained the data was found. The systematic reduction of effects began with ordering of all effects present in the model using the likelihood-ratio test statistic. A backward stepwise elimination was then completed, which evaluated the significance of changes in log-likelihood. Buildmer defaults were used with the following exceptions. To ensure adequate convergence, the maximum number of iterations used for analysis was 200,000. The approach used for the p values of the mixed effects model was the Satterthwaite approximation (Luke, 2017) . Nonsignificant effect terms and those not included in significant interactions (p > .05) were also removed from the model as part of the model-testing procedure with the buildmer function. To complete post hoc comparisons, the reference levels were systematically re-referenced using the lme4 package (v1.1-26; Bates et al., 2015) . With this procedure, the model does not change; the releveling instead allows for pairwise examinations of the contrasts in the model.",

Figure 1 shows the IEEE speech understanding scores for each listener for their functionally better ear (BE), functionally poorer ear (PE), and both ears together. The asymmetry difference cut-off of ! 20% difference between ears (Goupell et al., 2018; Mosnier et al., 2009 ) was met in four listeners. The right of the plot shows the averages and standard deviations of scores for each listening condition for the different listener groups. Figure 2 depicts the summary data for the CRM corpus task of speech understanding in the presence of a speech masker. Each panel shows performance at each TMR for the two AGC conditions with a single combination of listening condition (e.g., BE) and noise location (e.g., noise on PE side). Each row depicts a single listening condition (e.g., PE) and varying noise locations (noise on PE side, noise front, noise on BE side). Conversely, each column shows varying listening conditions (from top to bottom: BE, PE, and both) within a single noise location condition.

There was also a significant main effect of asymmetry, with poorer monaural performance associated with higher asymmetry (p \u00bc .04).

Figure 5 shows the calculated summation (top row) and squelch (bottom row) benefits for listeners' ears separately to explore the source of increased benefit with greater asymmetry. Listeners are shown in ascending order based on degree of asymmetry. For symmetric listeners, summation and squelch are similar across ears. With increasing asymmetry, summation and squelch increase in the functionally PE (the benefit of adding the functionally BE increases). This was observed for both independent (left column) and linked (right column) AGC conditions. Finally, we examined the SRM in this paradigm. It was calculated as the difference between the bilateral condition with co-located target and interferers and the average of the bilateral conditions with spatial separation between target and interferers (bottom row of Figure 3 ). Mean SRM for all listeners was 4.1% (SD \u00bc 3.3%). The SRM model summary is shown in Table 5 .

This experiment assessed the effects of linked AGCs for listeners with varying degrees of symmetry in speech understanding in the presence of a single-talker masker. There were two primary findings from the experiment. First, linked AGCs did not significantly improve performance. We had hypothesized a benefit of linked AGCs, with contributions from both head-shadow and squelch benefits, particularly at negative TMRs. Instead, results unexpectedly showed no significant difference between linked and independent AGCs (Figure 2 ). The present findings differed from those of previous studies investigating linked AGCs. For example, Wiggins and Seeber (2013) showed that in normal-hearing simulations of speech understanding in spatially separated noise, linked AGCs provided an approximately 8% improvement in scores compared to independent AGCs. Potts et al. (2019) found a 2.5-dB benefit of linked AGCs for BICI listeners with four-talker babble, an interferer more similar to the one used in the present experiment (a single talker). Although the Potts et al. (2019) experiment made use of speech maskers, the difference in benefit may be because they had more talkers, which could have allowed for more consistent engagement of the linked AGCs. In addition, the timing of their stimuli differed, with intermittent and continuous masking conditions. In the intermittent masking condition, they allowed 3 s of babble before the target was introduced on each trial but the babble ended with the conclusion of the target. In the continuous masking condition, they had babble presented continuously throughout the entire block. When linked AGC benefits were examined for these two types of stimuli, there was a larger benefit of linked AGCs in the continuous babble condition. Given that the evidence shows that linked AGCs are beneficial for speech-on-speech masking with multi-talker maskers but not with a single-talker masker and there is some effect of masker duration, there may be limitations in this technology providing a benefit in relatively shorter (specifically, sentencelong) speech-on-speech masking situations. Replicating this experiment with additional masker types and continuous maskers in the future would be informative to investigate how masker type and duration impact the effect of linked AGCs in more detail.",

Across listeners of varying degrees of symmetry there were no significant differences with AGC type for head shadow, summation, and squelch (Figure 4) , as well as overall SRM.

            "text": "As predicted, there was a significant head-shadow benefit and asymmetry interaction, where more asymmetrical listeners had smaller benefits than more symmetrical (Table 3) . However, there were also significant interactions between summation and squelch benefits and asymmetry in the opposite direction, where more asymmetrical listeners had larger benefits than more symmetrical (Tables 2  and 4 ). This again was contrary to our initial hypothesis that benefit values would be smaller for asymmetrical listeners. The larger summation and squelch values for asymmetric listeners likely arise from adding a functionally better ear. For these listeners, monaural performance with the functionally poorer ear is so low that when the functionally better ear is added, there is a large improvement in the binaural score even when the additional ear has a poorer TMR ( Figure 5 ). For the summation calculation, rather than measuring the benefit of added redundant information, there is a larger benefit of new information when the functionally better ear is added. For the squelch calculation, this larger improvement is not likely the result of improved binaural processing; instead again it is more likely the benefit of adding new information with a functionally better ear. The current results are similar to those of another study that examined bilateral benefits for BICI and bimodal (hearing aid plus cochlear implant) users (Kokkinakis & Pak, 2014) . Although functional performance asymmetry across ears was not directly measured in that experiment, because bimodal listeners have acoustic and electric hearing, they likely are more functionally asymmetric than BICI listeners. They found, as in this study, that for the cues requiring a monaural and binaural comparison-summation and squelch-the bimodal listeners had larger bilateral benefits, reaching significance for summation. They also found that head shadow was reduced in the bimodal group, but this difference was not significant. This similar pattern of results is further evidence that functional asymmetry may artificially inflate bilateral benefits that depend on a monaural-binaural comparison. Another study in the bimodal literature defined bimodal benefit as improvement with the addition of the functionally poorer ear, rather than averaging the benefit across ears (Dieudonn e & Francart, 2020). A similar approach could be taken in cases of functional asymmetry for BICI listeners to avoid artificial inflation of bilateral benefit measurements. In summary, for the asymmetrical CI listeners in this study and others in the literature, improvements in summation and squelch from adding a functionally better ear is a monaural consequence, not from binaural processing. The influence of monaural effects on classic measures of binaural benefits should be considered in future studies investigating binaural benefits with functionally asymmetric hearing (Dieudonn e & Francart, 2019, 2020).",

This is in contrast to this study or others that have failed to find significant positive squelch using more realistic spatial configurations. The BICI listeners in Bernstein et al. (2016) were argued to be mostly symmetrical higher performers; in contrast to them, negative squelch (i.e., interference) was shown in asymmetrical lower performers using the same contralateral unmasking paradigm (Goupell et al., 2018) . If one were to combine the listeners from both studies, there would likely be little squelch on average. This argues for careful consideration of subject selection and measures of functional asymmetry for assessing bilateral benefits in BICI listeners. One aspect that was consistent with the data and analysis in the current report and the interpretation of the data from Experiment 2 in Goupell et al.

Given our limited testing, it seems plausible that there are many spatial configurations and stimuli that would produce advantages of linked AGCs. In addition to aforementioned discussion of masker types and duration effects, head movements could also interact with independent AGCs, altering ILDs in a way that depends on the speed and duration of head movement (Archer-Boyd & Carlyon, 2019).

These interactions were believed to be a result of improvements in speech understanding due to adding a second, more intelligible input compared to the likely distorted monaural input of their functionally poorer ear alone. That is, the increased summation or squelch was not a result of better binaural processing abilities but a monaural phenomenon. Interactions between asymmetry and interferer location when calculating benefits were in the predicted direction, with decreased head-shadow benefit with greater asymmetry.
