This has been fuelled in part by the clinical success of B cell depletion therapies (BCDTs). Originally conceived as a method of eliminating cancerous B cells, BCDTs such as those targeting CD20, CD19 and BAFF are now used to treat autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis. The use of BCDTs in autoimmune disease has led to some surprises. For example, although antibody-secreting plasma cells are thought to have a negative pathogenic role in autoimmune disease, BCDT, even when it controls the disease, has limited impact on these cells and on antibody levels. In this Review, we update our understanding of B cell biology, review the results of clinical trials using BCDT in autoimmune indications, discuss hypotheses for the mechanism of action of BCDT and speculate on evolving strategies for targeting B cells beyond depletion.",

With a half-life of approximately 6 weeks, the NBCs circulate in the blood and enter lymph node organs through high endothelial venules. Unless they are activated by an antigen, B cells will spend approximately 24 hours in follicles, which are structures found in the lymph node cortex. They are drawn to these structures because NBCs express CXC-chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5), which binds to its ligand, CXC-chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13); CXCL13 is expressed in the follicle. Following this brief residence in the follicle, NBCs follow the gradient of a different molecule, sphingosine 1-phosphate, to the medullary cords and out through the efferent lymphatics. After transitioning through the thoracic duct, NBCs re-enter the blood and repeat this journey 2 .",

These cognate B cell-T cell interactions occur in the germinal centres (GCs) in secondary lymphoid organs.

Expression of CD40L by T helper cells is a key ingredient for a functional T cell-dependent germinal centre response through stimulation of CD40 on B cells. cytidine deaminase (AID). This process results in multiple variants of the original germ line BCR, and the B cells that emerge from this mutagenesis programme with the highest affinity for the antigen will 'win' the GC reaction competition and become dominant clones in the immune response 5 .

GCs are readily observed in histological sections of secondary lymphoid organs (tonsils, spleen and lymph nodes) in mice and humans. Somatic hypermutation mediated by AID may increase the affinity of the BCR, but may also reduce its affinity, or even generate an affinity for self-antigen. Due to its anatomical organization (Box 2), the GC environment imposes a framework of competition among GC-resident B cells such that those B cells with the highest affinity for an antigen persist and become MBCs and PCs. Advances in our understanding of this GC reaction may inform the design of specific therapies that interfere with this specialized microenvironment. For example, in the past 10 years, our understanding of how T follicular helper cells (T FH cells) and regulatory T FH cells engage with B cells has exploded 10 . In mouse models, entanglement of GC-resident T FH cells with GC B cells promotes sustained interactions that select for B cells with the highest affinity for an antigen through a process of feedforward loops involving CD40L, inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) and BAFF (also known as TNFSF13B) 11 . This entanglement is reminiscent of the types of CD40-CD40L-driven B cell-T cell interactions that occur in human tonsils 12 . Although beyond the scope of this Review, removing or disabling T FH cells to prevent the GC reaction is a possible strategy for treating autoimmune disease.",

Moreover, in other lupus-prone mouse models, autoreactive antibody-producing B cells can be generated in extrafollicular regions independently of T cells; B cell survival factors such as BAFF and pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) play important roles in the generation of these B cells 27, 28 . Although extrafollicular responses clearly produce class-switched B cells, in contrast, and in keeping with older findings in the literature, GCs are dominated by non-class-switched IgM + B cells in mice and humans 29 .

Of these, B cells that express T-bet (also known as TBX21) may play a particularly important role in autoimmune diseases. T-bet is a transcription factor that historically has been considered a hallmark of IFN\u03b3-producing T helper 1 cells. However, T-bet can also be expressed in B cells 32 , and even in dendritic cells 33 , in both mice and humans. T-bet + B cells are commonly referred to as double-negative (DN) B cells, as they express neither CD27 (also known as TNFRSF7) In the spleen, they first become naive B cells (NBCs). If activated by an antigen (Ag), NBCs may then enter an emerging germinal centre (GC), where affinity maturation occurs. The highest-affinity B cells emerge from the GC as memory B cells or plasma cells. Some NBCs can also be activated in extrafollicular environments, for example in the T cell area or in the medullary cords. NBCs activated in extrafollicular environments quickly become plasma cells. In the presence of IFN\u03b3, B cells also can also acquire the expression of T-bet, and some T-bet + cells will remain in the spleen as memory B cells. Some T-bet + cells can adopt a double-negative 1 (DN1) or DN2 phenotype, with the latter being influenced by cytokines such as IL-21. CXCR, CXC-chemokine receptor; Ig, immunoglobulin; T FH cell, T follicular helper cell. DN B cells are further divided into DN1 and DN2 subsets. B cells that express high levels of T-bet (T-bet hi B cells) can be directly generated from NBC precursors in response to IFN\u03b3 (which is locally produced by T cells) 35 , and consequently become 'activated naive' or DN1 B cells 36 . In addition, some T-bet hi B cells have the capacity to quickly differentiate into PCs in an IL-21-dependent manner in patients with SLE 37 . These B cells are DN2 cells. Importantly, DN2 cells also lack CXCR5, and thus extrafollicular responses may have contributed to their generation 38 . As discussed in subsequent sections, T-bet hi DN1 and DN2 cells are enriched in patients with SLE. Because of their propensity to rapidly differentiate into antibody-secreting cells in response to cytokines, T-bet hi DN2 cells could be a source of surges of autoantibodies, whether directly pathogenic or a reflection of generalized B cell activation.",

Of note, in mice, T-bet hi MBCs accumulate with age 40, 41 and in autoimmune diseases such as MS 42 , and could therefore contribute to disease chronicity, particularly in aged patients. Although more research is required to understand whether T-bet hi MBCs have a propensity to promote autoimmune disease pathology, they deserve some consideration in particular because many T-bet hi MBCs do not circulate. Hence, we do not know whether they are depleted by anti-CD20 or anti-CD19 (rEF. 39 ), although the few that do circulate are sensitive to BAFF inhibition 43 . Thus, the very large population of MBCs that reside within the spleen (and possibly other tissues, as has been observed in chronic infections) may not be fully depleted, especially if they reside in vasculature-poor regions 44 .

In mice, PBs and PCs that produce GM-CSF are thought to be derived from peritoneal cavity B-1 cells (Box 1) that migrate to the spleen, where they produce IgM. In contrast, IL-17 is produced directly by PCs in the spleen upon infection with Trypanosoma cruzi 61, 62 . IgA-producing PCs in the mouse intestine can express either TNF or inducible nitrogen oxide synthase (iNOS), and this expression is required for resolution of Citrobacter rodentium infection 63 .

Our laboratory has shown that mucosally derived IgA-producing PCs are a potent source of IL-10, and that they can express IL-10 within the inflamed brain and spinal cord during EAE 81 . Because the microbiota has been implicated in the production of IL-10 by mucosal B cells 82 , this sug gests that the dysbiosis which occurs during some chronic autoimmune diseases may impinge on the ability of B cell lineage cells to suppress inflammation. At the very least, the concept that 'regulatory PCs' 83 might exist must be carefully considered when one is interpreting BCDTs that differentially target PCs.

B cells from patients with RA also produce proinflammatory cytokines, and PCs in the joint produce TNF, one of the key cytokines involved in RA 121 . Importantly, joint-resident B cells also make RANKL (also known as TNFSF11), which could actively promote bone destruction 122 .

This was fuelled by genetic observations (the MS risk is associated with the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele) 136 , histopathology studies (T cells are much more abundant than B cells in MS lesions) 84, 137 and the key observation that adoptive transfer of activated myelinspecific T cells into naive mice is sufficient to cause EAE 138 . However, in other species, such as the marmoset, B cells are necessary for disease 139, 140 . Ironically, the importance of B cells in MS has been appreciated for many years. One of the earliest diagnostics for MS was the presence of IgG oligoclonal bands in the CSF, implying the presence of intrathecal antibody-producing cells 141, 142 . Evidence of B cell accumulation in CNS lesions 143 and ectopic B cell follicles in the meninges of patients with SPMS (and, to a lesser extent, those with PPMS) 137,144 further implicated B cells in the aetiopathology of the disease. Deposition of complexes containing antibodies and complement components in MS plaques also suggests that B cells are important in MS pathogenesis 145, 146 , although in a separate study these complexes were not found to be a specific feature of lesions, nor a hallmark of MS in particular 147 . To date, no specific autoantibody has been demonstrated to be pathogenic and/or pathognomonic.",

Furthermore, MRI scans of the brain with T2-weighted images showed that ocrelizumab-treated patients had much smaller lesion volumes than patients who received IFN\u03b2. Although ocrelizumab was not as efficacious in PPMS as it was in RRMS, the ORATORIO clinical trial nevertheless met its primary end point and four of the five secondary end points. Since the progressive form of MS has very few treatment options, ocrelizumab has been approved by the FDA for this patient population and has begun to meet the significant unmet need. Notably, ocrelizumab seems to work better in a subset of younger patients (younger than 51 years) with PPMS who also have active inflammation 170 .",

A subcutaneously delivered form of ofatumumab had similar results to other BCDTs in phase II trials (such as MIRROR and APLIOS, NCT03560739) 162 , and outperformed teriflunomide, a front-line therapy for MS, in a phase III trial 163 . One major advantage of subcutaneous delivery, compared with intravenous delivery (which is used for most BCDTs), is that it renders a drug easier for patients to self-administer. The phase III trials ASCLEPIOS I and ASCLEPIOS II (NCT02792218 and NCT02792231) are currently testing the efficacy of ofatumumab delivered via an autoinjector pen. Ublituximab is a next-generation anti-CD20 IgG1 mAb that binds an epitope on CD20 (including residues 168-171 and 158 and 159) that is distinct from the epitope bound by rituximab and ocrelizumab 171 or the epitope bound by ofatumumab 172 . Ublituximab has been glycoengineered to have a low fucose content in its Fc region, which should enhance its affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptors and maximize antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) toward B cells 173, 174 . In phase II clinical trials, ublituximab also led to B cell depletion and a reduction in gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions, T2 lesion volume and annualized relapse rate 171 . Ublituximab is currently being evaluated in phase III clinical trials (ULTIMATE 1 (NCT03277261) and ULTIMATE 2 (NCT03277248)). Advancements in anti-CD20 therapies are key as they may both increase efficacy and improve access for patients.",

Targeting CD19 instead of CD20 affects a wider array of B cells, and includes PBs, which may significantly contribute to inflammation in the CNS 175, 176 . In a phase I clinical trial, an anti-CD19 antibody (inebilizumab) showed a trend towards fewer gadoliniumenhancing lesions as well as a reduction in the number of new or newly enlarged T2-weighted lesions 177 . Evobrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, has also been tested in a phase II clinical trial. Evobrutinib reduced brain lesions as assessed by MRI, but did not alter the annualized relapse rate or disability progression 178 . However, the trial enrolled patients with an unusually high baseline level of clinical disability, and patients were older than www.nature.com/nrd those in similar trials. Thus, it is possible that some of the enrolled patients may have been transitioning from RRMS to SPMS, a form of MS that is fairly resistant to BCDT 178 . The evolutionRMS 1 and evolutionRMS 2 (NCT04338022 and NCT004338061) trials are currently examining the potential of evobrutinib in phase III clinical trials. Tolebrutinib (formerly SAR442168 or PRN-2246), another promising BTK inhibitor, is slated for phase III clinical trials in RRMS (GEMINI 1 (NCT04410978) and GEMINI 2 (NCT04410991)), SPMS (HERCULES (NCT04411641)) and PPMS (PERSEUS (NCT04458051)). Two features that distinguish BTK inhibitors from those targeting CD20 or other surface markers are that BTK inhibition may also target myeloid cells, which express BTK 179 , and that the increased bioavailability of BTK inhibitors within the CNS relative to antibody-based therapies may increase their efficacy.",

The ATAMS phase II clinical trial was designed to do this by treating patients with MS with atacicept, the TACI-Ig fusion protein that binds and sequesters both BAFF and APRIL 180 . The hope was that atacicept would have a greater impact than CD20-directed therapies on MS because it would also impact PC survival. However, to the surprise of MS researchers, patients treated with atacicept experienced a dose-dependent increase in annualized relapse rates, and the atacicept treatment arm contained a lower proportion of relapse-free patients than the placebo arm. Therefore, due to the increased frequency of relapses, the clinical trial was prematurely discontinued 180 . In ATON, a phase II randomized clinical trial, patients who presented with optic neuritis as a clinically isolated syndrome were treated with atacicept and monitored over time 181 . Unfortunately, enrolment in ATON was halted because of the results in the ATAMS trial, but preliminary results in ATON showed less degeneration of retinal nerve fibre layer thickness with atacicept treatment. Despite this encouraging reduction in retinal nerve fibre layer damage, a greater proportion of patients in the atacicept group (6/17) had a second clinical attack and converted to clinically definite MS than in the placebo group (3/17) . From the findings taken together, atacicept is not an appropriate treatment for MS; we speculate on reasons why this may be the case in the section entitled \"Potential mechanism of action of BCDT\".",

Early studies indicated that some patients with MS were seropositive for anti-MOG IgG 182, 183 . Moreover, immunization of mice with recombinant human MOG induces an EAE-like disease that is characterized by an anti-MOG IgG1 response that is necessary for clinical symptoms [184] [185] [186] . However, contrary to initial hypotheses, on closer examination, antibodies in the blood and CSF of patients with MS were not specific for the correctly folded form of MOG 187, 188 . Soluble forms of the antigen are measured by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or western blot techniques 189 , but detection of antibodies to conformationally appropriate MOG, which is more biologically relevant, uses transfected human cells that express full-length MOG on the cell surface 190 . With these better diagnostic criteria, patients with MS had levels of anti-MOG that were very low, similar to those of healthy controls [191] [192] [193] [194] , thus upending the concept that anti-MOG antibodies play a pathogenic role in MS. However, antibodies to other CNS antigens, particularly neuronal and glial targets, have been identified in patients with MS and may participate in the aetiopathology of the disease [195] [196] [197] [198] . These antibodies are specific to diverse antigens, often to intracellular targets that reflect cell damage, and are possibly generated secondary to the initiating autoimmune attack 188, [199] [200] [201] .",

These disorders have a range of phenotypes and are collectively referred to as MOG spectrum disorders (MOGSDs). Patients with MOGSDs largely present with an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis-like phenotype in younger patients and opticospinal phenotypes in older patients. Antibody-mediated demyelination (possibly via anti-MOG antibodies) plays a role in these syndromes, and these disorders are now being teased apart from a similar set of diseases, NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSDs) 203 . MOGSDs provide an opportunity to assess the impact of BCDT in an antibody-mediated CNS disease setting. However, the heterogeneity of patients makes it difficult to conclusively determine the success or failure of a therapy 204, 205 . Current treatment options for patients with an MOGSD include steroids or plasma exchange 206 . In early reports, rituximab had mixed clinical efficacy in MOGSD 205, 207, 208 . More recently, a study in 121 patients with MOG antibody-associated disorder (MOGAD) showed that rituximab reduced relapse rates in patients with this disorder, but many patients continued to relapse despite B cell depletion 209 .",

NMOSD, a disease that primarily affects the spinal cord, optic nerves and brainstem, was previously considered a clinical variant of MS 210 . Examination of autoantibodies obtained from patients with NMOSD indicated that NMO-IgG, which are antibodies to aquaporin 4 (AQP4), are a unique feature not found in patients with MS 211,212 . In a report of patients with NMOSD at the national UK NMO clinic, 73% of patients were seropositive for NMO-IgG 213 . Of the NMO-IgG-seronegative patients, 42% were positive for anti-MOG IgG, further complicating the delineation between NMOSD and MOGSD. APQ4, which is targeted by NMO-IgG, is found on glial cells, and binding of NMO-IgG decreases aquaporin surface expression, resulting in increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier and complement activation, which promotes pathologies such as gliosis and axonal damage 212, 214 . An anti-CD19 antibody, inebilizumab, was recently approved for NMO-IgG-seropositive patients with NMOSD following a promising phase II/III placebo-controlled clinical trial (N-Momentum (NCT02200770)) 215 . Anti-CD20 treatment also shows good clinical efficacy in NMOSD, although the therapeutic benefit does not correlate with a decrease in NMO-IgG levels in the blood 207, 216 . A TACI-Ig fusion protein, RC18, is also currently being examined in NMOSD in an interventional phase III clinical trial (NCT03330418). Therefore, the effect of BCDT in NMOSD is an active area of research, but observed reductions in disease are not entirely explained by a reduction in the autoantibody response. This observation suggests that NMOSD pathogenesis is not exclusively caused by NMO-IgG, or, alternatively, that measurements of these antibodies in the serum do not reflect ongoing pathogenesis in the CNS 216 .",

One of most common autoantibody-mediated encephalitis syndromes is characterized by a response to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). NMDAR is an ion channel and glutamate receptor that is critical for neurotransmitter signalling. Two primary causes of NMDAR encephalitis are currently understood. A small proportion of patients have anti-NMDAR encephalitis following infection with herpes simplex virus 1 (rEF. 218 ). More commonly, women with ovarian teratomas that express NMDARs can generate an NMDAR autoantibody response to the teratoma, and these antibodies eventually target NMDARs within the CNS 219 . This phenomenon was described in the popular Brain on Fire book and film, which were based on the experiences of a journalist at the New York Post who experienced anti-NMDAR autoimmunity 217 . Pathology from NMDAR autoantibodies is mediated by crosslinking NMDARs at the synapses on CNS neurons, leading to reduced levels of NMDAR, which likely alters memory, learning and other cognitive functions 220 . Despite the ovarian teratoma trigger, the anti-NMDAR immune response seems well compartmentalized to the CNS. Early reports have shown that rituximab leads to clinical improvement for anti-NMDAR encephalitis; however, it is not clear whether these improvements are because of changes in B cell numbers or because of changes in autoantibody levels 221 . Two BCDT trials are being conducted in anti-NMDAR encephalitis using rituximab (IANMDAR, a prospective phase II trial in paediatric patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis (NCT03274375)) and inebilizumab (ExTINGUISH, a randomized phase IIb trial (NCT04372615)).",

A subset of patients with MG test negative for antibodies to AChR and patients in those seronegative subgroups can be positive for other autoantibodies, such as anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (anti-MuSK) IgG4 or anti-LRP4 IgG1 or IgG2. Standard treatment for MG includes the use of immunosuppressive steroids 223 , but BCDT has also been investigated as a more targeted approach. Of note, patients with anti-MuSK antibodies fared better with rituximab therapy than patients with other autoantibodies such as anti-AChR 224, 225 . Efficacy in patients with anti-MuSK antibodies correlated with a reduction in anti-MuSK IgG4 in the serum; of note, the anti-AChR antibodies were predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 (rEF. 225 ).

            "text": "On the basis of the success of BCDT in some indications, second-generation anti-CD20 mAbs have rapidly emerged. Different anti-CD20 mAbs evoke distinct cytotoxic mechanisms: complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDC), Fc\u03b3R-mediated depletion through cellular effector mechanisms including ADCC and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and directly inducing cell death 229 . Anti-CD20 mAbs can be divided into two types (type I and type II) on the basis of their ability to redistribute CD20 into plasma membrane lipid rafts, and their potency in assays measuring CDC, homotypic adhesion and programmed cell death induction 230 . More recently, with use of cryo-electron microscopy it has been shown that type I mAbs can act as molecular 'seeds' to increase the local mAb concentration, which promotes CDC 231 . The first generation of genetically engineered chimeric anti-CD20 mAbs, such as rituximab and ocrelizumab, are type I mAbs. Rituximab comprises a murine variable region (Fab) and a human constant region (Fc), whereas ocrelizumab is a humanized anti-CD20 IgG1. Ocrelizumab has superior ADCC activity in comparison with rituximab 232, 233 . The main mechanism through which type I anti-CD20 mAbs deplete B cells is by redistribution of CD20 into lipid rafts: mAb-driven CD20 clustering results in CDC, although the process of cell death is independent of raft formation 234 . However, internalization of type I anti-CD20 mAbs from the surface via Fc\u03b3RIIb results is derived from treatment with anti-CD20 agents and is depicted here. We hypothesize that the efficacy of BCDT in some autoimmune diseases begins with a reset of the B cell pool in the periphery. By elimination of CD20 + memory B cells, some of which may be producing proinflammatory cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), the periphery is enriched with naive B cells and IL-10-producing regulatory B cells. Moreover, short-lived plasmablasts that are potentially autoreactive are not replenished by autoreactive memory B cells after BCDT. Long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs), however, which are present in the bone marrow (BM) and gut, are not eliminated. Surges in BAFF levels that occur after BCDT may promote the accumulation of immunoregulatory LLPCs, which could have a beneficial effect in some diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. In target tissues, B cells in tertiary lymphoid tissues (TLTs) may not be replaced. Consequently, the ability for other pathogenic immune cells to take up residence in the inflamed tissue may be compromised, and other immunoregulatory cells, such as T follicular helper cells (T FH cells), may take up residence, resulting in reduced disease. LT\u03b1 3 , lymphotoxin-\u03b1 3 ; PC, plasma cell; TNF, tumour necrosis factor. in resistance to therapy and decreased clinical efficacy 235 . Type II mAbs, such as obinutuzumab, are fully humanized mAbs. Compared with rituximab, this type II mAb binds to a different epitope, and does not induce efficient clustering of CD20 or antibody internalization, thus increasing efficacy and decreasing possible treatment resistance 236 . Hence these type II mAbs may have greater efficacy in diseases in which BCDT has shown only marginal efficacy.",

One relatively straightforward reason for this variability is that pathogenic B cells in some scenarios are difficult to access (for example, because B cells localize into TLTs in the synovium or the leptomeninges). The depth of B cell depletion may therefore depend on the target tissue. For instance, the levels of synovial B cells were decreased but not fully eliminated in RA after BCDT 117 . Also, GC B cells in Peyer patches and peritoneal B-1 cells resist rituximab treatment in human CD20 transgenic mice, as these antibodies need to access the vasculature to deliver the antibody-bound B cells to effector cells of the reticuloendothelial system 44 . In MS, B cell depletion is effective in the blood and CSF 164, 165 , but variable in the CNS 237, 238 . Inflammation in MS can be CNS compartmentalized into TLTs (for example, in the leptomeninges), so B cells may persist in these locations, particularly because survival factors such as BAFF are locally produced by astrocytes 239 . Furthermore, a substantial reservoir of T-bet + MBCs that express CD11c resides in the spleen and does not circulate. T-bet + MBCs can be precursors to antibody-producing cells that could play a pathogenic role in autoimmune diseases such as SLE 39 . It is unclear whether anti-CD20 treatment effectively depletes these tissue-resident cells.",

For example, CD20 is largely absent on subsets of LLPCs in healthy human bone marrow 240 and gut 106 . For this reason, anti-CD20 therapy does not substantially deplete LLPCs. New approaches that target CD19, such as using an anti-CD19 mAb or a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based T cell therapy, have been explored for some B cell malignancies 241 . However, a population of LLPCs that do not express CD19 nevertheless persists after infusion 242 . Thus, when anti-CD20 therapy has robust efficacy in diseases that are known to be mediated by autoantibodies, such as ANCA-associated vasculitis, NMO and pemphigus vulgaris, this efficacy may be due, at least in part, to a loss of short lived PBs or PCs that are not replaced because precursor B cells are also depleted.",

IL-6 produced by B cells has been clearly linked with the generation of a T helper 17 cell inflammatory immune response in EAE, and a similar observation has been made in humans: circulating B cells from patients with MS overproduce IL-6 in vitro, and anti-CD20 treatment normalizes IL-6 production 59 . Indeed, in patients with MS, B cells that were reconstituted following BCDT had totally different cytokine profiles compared with B cells from untreated patients. Reconstituted B cells were characterized by limited proinflammatory cytokine production and higher production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 (rEF. 60 ).

In addition, the presence of CSF-resident highly proliferative IFN\u03b3-producing CD4 + and CD8 + T cells that express CD20 positively correlates with disease severity in MS 254 .

Following anti-CD20 treatment in patients with MG, the relative proportion of PCs to B cells is increased, and IgA + MBCs outnumber other MBCs 257 . It is unclear why this happens, but it is important to remember that BAFF levels increase after rituximab treatment 102, 103 . This elevation of BAFF may have different effects in different disease settings. In some patients with MS, BAFF levels are elevated in both the serum and the CSF 258, 259 . Moreover, Steri et al. showed that a variant BAFF (also known as TNFSF13B) allele that favours overproduction of BAFF has been associated with MS 260 . This observation suggests that BAFF may be deleterious in MS. However, others have found that high blood BAFF levels correlate with a more stable disease course of MS 261 , and, as mentioned, BAFF inhibition with atacicept worsened MS disease 180 . The consequences of high BAFF levels in MS are unclear because of these contradictory observations. We have found that high BAFF levels strongly protect against EAE. In our study, mice that overexpressed BAFF had an abundance of IgA-producing PCs in the gut. These PCs also produce IL-10, and, when transferred into mice that lack IL-10, can confer protection against EAE 81 . BAFF and the related cytokine APRIL are key survival cytokines that sustain LLPCs 262 . APRIL can also promote class switching to IgA 18, 19 . Thus, one potential mechanism for the efficacy of anti-CD20 therapy in MS is that BAFF levels are increased after treatment and consequently promote the survival of immunoregulatory PCs, particularly gut-derived IgA + PCs. Indeed, patients with RA who were treated with rituximab still have of IgA + PCs in the lamina propria in gut biopsy samples 263 . This may also explain why inhibition of BAFF by atacicept had a negative outcome for patients with MS 180 .",

            "text": "The field of BCDT began with a rather crude instrument (antibodies that deplete all CD20 + B cells). The clinical experiments performed with anti-CD20 therapy, however, have been surprising and revealing, spurring on research into how B cells impact disease. Our rudimentary idea that PCs and antibodies are 'bad' has matured considerably into a more nuanced view of B cells in health and disease. Moving forward, it will be important to not merely ascribe increasingly specific subset designations on the basis of emerging RNA sequencing data in the absence of a holistic view of the environment in which B cells differentiate and exist. For example, the microbiome is a key environmental factor that influences B cell phenotype 63 . Taking cues from our co-evolution with pathogens, new perspectives on the roles of B cells in autoimmune disease will undoubtedly emerge. These perspectives, combined with advances in antibody technologies, should increase the efficacy and specificity of BCDTs in autoimmune diseases. Fig. 4 | Future approaches using B cell-targeted therapies in autoimmune disease. The next generation of B celltargeted therapies, rather than B cell depletion therapies, will need to target specific proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory B cell functions. BAFF homotrimers versus higher-order aggregates (60-mers) of BAFF or APRIL impact different B cell subsets differently. Inhibiting BAFF homotrimers could have a beneficial effect because it may remove T-bet + B cells and/or B cells that participate in the extrafollicular response. Because a subtype of T-bet + B cells (double-negative 2 (DN2) cells, which are considered to be non-circulating memory B cells) gives rise to antibody-producing plasmablasts and plasma cells in an IL-21-dependent manner, IL-21 blockade may ameliorate disease by inhibiting these non-circulating memory B cells. However, supplementation with BAFF 60-mers or APRIL may promote the accumulation of IgA + immunoregulatory plasma cells, which could be beneficial in multiple sclerosis (MS). Likewise, the levels of immunoregulatory plasma cells may be increased by manipulating the microbiota. The germinal centre (GC) itself is the source of somatically hypermutated B cells that play an important role in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Interrupting the entanglement between B cells and T follicular helper cells T (T FH cells) by blocking CD40 (or other candidates such as inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS)) could provide a means for staving off this source of potentially bad B cells. In tertiary lymphoid tissues (TLTs), removal of B cells may change the cellular environment of TLT, reducing its ability to foster autoimmune reactions.",
