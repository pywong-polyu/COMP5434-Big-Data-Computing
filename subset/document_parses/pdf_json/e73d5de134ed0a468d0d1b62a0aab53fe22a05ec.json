Consequently, the role of COVID-19 vaccinations in complementing the individual preventive measures to face the pandemic has become vital, and vaccination coverage is regarded as critical for maintaining efficient public health measures [2] . Since the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, governments worldwide have exerted tremendous efforts to execute effective procurement and vaccination programs for individuals [3] . However, with the initiation of vaccination programs at the country level, several issues related to vaccines' acceptability, effectiveness, and safety have become the focus of community concerns [4] . Consequently, the expected and estimated acceptability rates of vaccines vary across countries. In addition, a significant difference in the efficiency of vaccination programs in terms of coverage of eligible communities and addressing vaccine hesitancy concerns have also been reported [5] . Vaccine hesitancy has been identified as a major determinant of vaccine uptake in the community [6] . An Italian study by Napolitano et al. reported that more than 50% of the study population expressed their need to receive further vaccine-related information to help in countering their vaccine hesitancy [7] . In addition, communication, media coverage, and the attitude towards prevention have been reported as primary factors that affect vaccine hesitancy [8] .",

However, there has been debate in the community about vaccines' permissibility in general, contributing to vaccine hesitancy in some cases [9] . Malaysia has increased its vaccination rate in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, to the point where 62% of the population has been fully vaccinated as of 01/10/2021 [10] . The national COVID-19 vaccination program is considered critical for future societal protection and economic recovery planning. According to previous international reports, vaccine acceptability and hesitancy are influenced by various cultural, societal, and awareness factors [11, 12] . Consequently, health care providers have implemented several vaccination advocacy initiatives to raise community awareness regarding the critical role vaccines play in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic [13] .",

Phase 1 of the national vaccination program for COVID-19 has been completed and effectively covered frontliners, including public and private healthcare personnel [3] . Phase 2 has started to cover the remainder of healthcare personnel and senior citizens, while phase 3 is dedicated to the remaining eligible residents of the country not covered in the first two phases [3] . With the program's implementation, it is essential to explore people's attitudes, perceptions, and experiences of side effects of their received COVID-19 vaccinations. These findings will be necessary to support the program further and identify the need to foster the success rate of this national initiative [14] . However, little has been reported regarding the attitudes and experiences of a sample of COVID-19-vaccinated and vaccine-eligible individuals concurrently with the ongoing national vaccination program. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the attitudes, perceptions, and experiences of side effects of COVID-19 vaccines in Malaysia.",

Other items with a CVI of <0.83 were omitted from the final questionnaire. The final questionnaire consisted of two main parts. Part 1 (19 items) covered primary participants' sociodemographic characteristics, attitudes, and perceptions toward COVID-19 vaccines and the national vaccination program. Meanwhile, part 2 (8 items) covered the experiences of vaccinated individuals regarding the type of received vaccine, experienced side effects and severity, the personal behavior after being vaccinated, and the source of information about COVID-19 vaccines. The questionnaire was designed and distributed via a digital platform. Depending on whether they had been vaccinated or not, the participants had the option of responding only to part 1 (general attitudes and perceptions) or part 2 (experiences). Incomplete responses, on the other hand, were not considered in the data analysis.",

However, about one-fifth did not believe that they received accurate and sufficient information regarding COVID-19 vaccines. An Italian study by Di Giuseppe et al. has highlighted that participants who perceived that they received adequate information about the COVID-19 vaccines were less likely to have concerns about the safety of the vaccines [23] . Transparency in disseminating vaccines and COVID-19 updates by government health officials is vital to prevent distrust towards vaccines. It has been reported that different countries had different COVID-19 vaccines acceptance rates. However, Malaysia was among the highest (94.3%) other than Ecuador (97.0%), Indonesia (93.3%), and China (91.3%), whereas the lowest acceptance rates were found in Kuwait (23.6%), Jordan (28.4%), Italy (53.7), Russia (54.9%), Poland (56.3%), US (56.9%), and France (58.9%) [5] . However, a recent finding from a repeated cross-sectional survey conducted in Hong Kong and China highlighted that the COVID-19 acceptance was lower by 10% in the third wave compared to the initially reported rate in the first wave affected by the growing concerns on vaccine safety and the increasing compliance to personal protective behaviors [24] . Therefore, maintaining acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines has also been linked to the level of trust towards information from government sources and employer's advice [19] , particularly in addressing newly developed vaccines with expedited development or approval with political orientation and interference [22] .",

The most common concern was related to the vaccine safety reported previously to hinder vaccine uptake to a certain extent [28] . Some other issues were related to the perceived effectiveness of the vaccine, and willingness to protect others had been reported to influence the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines [29] . A recent study conducted in Mozambique showed that the concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines were more frequently reported than the safety concerns (52% vs. 29.6%), which underpinned that vaccine hesitancy is significantly affected by the perceived benefit of getting vaccinated [30] . Vaccine hesitancy is a complex global issue involving differences in sociodemographic and external factors, and thus tailored strategies to local intervention must be implemented in the specific population [19, 31] . Community intervention has been shown to improve the influenza vaccination rate in specific populations by addressing their concerns [32] . In addition, educational interventions to increase awareness and recommendations of human papillomavirus vaccines has been reported to be effective [33] . In addition, a recent Italian study has examined the willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccines among the university population; the findings demonstrated that males were less likely to have concerns about getting vaccinated, and therefore they were more likely to receive their recommended vaccines [34] . In comparison, our findings showed a statistically significant difference between males and females on their perception of receiving accurate and sufficient vaccinerelated information, where males frequently believed that they did not receive adequate vaccine-related information. This point could be of relevant consideration in the vaccine advocacy initiatives.",

The side effects tend to be more pronounced with the second dose, especially those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (Cominarty \u00ae ) vaccine. These findings could be further explored in the context of vaccine pre-medications to lessen the severity of side effects. The results showed that males, older individuals (\u226560 years), and those receiving the Sinovac (CoronaVac \u00ae ) vaccine were less likely to experience side effects. Previous research conducted among health care workers in Turkey reported that females and younger individuals were more likely to report vaccine-related side effects [36] . Additionally, a previous report during the investigation of mRNA vaccines highlighted those older individuals were less likely to experience vaccine-related systemic side effects [37] .",

The Sinovac vaccine is an inactivated vaccine, while Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca are nucleic acid and viral vectored vaccines, respectively. Therefore, the differences in the intensity and pattern of side effects could be attributed to the difference in vaccine type as reported previously in comparing potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates [38] . Notably, preliminary reports on the differences between COVID-19 vaccine candidates indicated that Sinovac vaccines might be associated with approximately five times fewer side effects than the other two tested vaccines [38] . Meanwhile, our findings revealed that Sinovac had a 12 times lower correlation with side effects. The side effects after the second dose were more with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which correlates with the reported data that the systemic side effects of this type of vaccine tend to increase with the second dose [38] . Although several countries have suspended the Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S) vaccine, especially among younger people, due to reports of vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenic thrombosis [39] , the vaccine has been used in Malaysia taking the age and the overall vaccination benefit into consideration. The majority of respondents had minor/mild side effects, which were similar to what had been reported by previous studies [40, 41] , but 10.3% experienced moderately severe to severe side effects, which require further investigation.",
