Conditions existing during fi eld operations such as crowded living conditions may have untoward effects on operational readiness and effi ciency of military forces and could make them more susceptible to disease outbreaks (e.g., respiratory and diarrheal). 9 Laboratory-based disease surveillance can be useful during military operations to confi rm the presence of specifi c pathogens and lead to more accurate assessments of the local infectious disease threat. This information may also be useful in formulating effective prevention and treatment strategies for these acute illnesses in deployed military personnel.

Supplies including viral transport media (VTM; Remel, Lenexa, Kansas) and sterile Dacron swabs for respiratory specimen collection, cups for stool specimen collection, and dry ice were provided to the 31st MEU BAS medical staff by USAMC-AFRIMS. BAS medical staff was briefed about appropriate specimen collection and handling before start of actual collection. U.S. active duty personnel who presented for medical care with a chief complaint of acute diarrhea (3 or more unformed stools during a 24-hour period within 72 hours of presentation) or acute respiratory symptoms (history of fever [\u2265100.4\u00b0F] with cough or sore throat) were considered eligible for inclusion in the surveillance program. If the patient gave his verbal agreement, one stool specimen (for acute diarrheal symptoms) or two nasal swabs (for acute respiratory symptoms) were collected and frozen on-site. Stool specimens were collected at the BAS by providing stool cups to patients to collect samples. Approximately 4-10 g of stool were collected, and 3 aliquots of stool (approximately 1 g each) were prepared. Stool specimens were placed immediately on dry ice after aliquoting. For respiratory specimens, 2 nasal swabs were collected from each patient. A Dacron-tipped swab was inserted 1-2 cm into each nostril, rotated for approximately 5 seconds, and placed into a tube containing VTM. Nasal specimens were placed immediately on dry ice. In addition, a questionnaire about clinical symptoms, demographics, and exposures was completed by the BAS staff. All specimen containers and corresponding clinical questionnaires were anonymized by labeling only with a unique identifi cation number and the date of collection at the fi eld site with no link between the identification number and the patient's name. The specimens were transported on dry ice from the fi eld site to Manila (2-hour drive away) every 3-4 days and placed in a -70\u00b0C freezer for more extended storage. After the conclusion of the exercise, the specimens were shipped on dry ice to the AFRIMS laboratory in Bangkok, Thailand, for advanced testing.",

Viral RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers using Superscript III (Invitrogen) in a 20-\u03bcL reaction. Five microliters of cDNA were used as a template for MassTag PCR by using primers coupled to Masscode tags (Qiagen Masscode technology; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A 12-plex assay, which included 24 primers, was used to detect RNA viruses including infl uenza A and B; respiratory syncytial virus groups A and B; human coronavirus-229E and human coronavirus-OC43; human metapneumovirus; enterovirus; and human parainfl uenza viruses (HPIVs) 2, 3 and 4a. Five microliters of viral and bacterial DNA were added directly to the mixture of the 7-plex assay including 14 primers to detect DNA pathogens of human adenovirus, Haemophilus infl uenzae , Neisseria meningitidis , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Legionella pneumonia , and Mycoplasma pneumonia . Tests for HPIV 1 and Chlamydia were attempted but were considered not valid because 1 Masscode Tag was not detected for the HPIV 1 test and a positive control was not available for Chlamydia. PCR amplifi cation was performed using multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen) primers at 0.5 \u03bcM each, and the following cycling protocol was performed: initial heating step at 94\u00b0C for 10 minutes; fi rst 15 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 20 seconds followed by an annealing step with a temperature reduction of 1\u00b0C increments from 65\u00b0C to 51\u00b0C; and then continuing with the next 35 cycles using the following cycling profi le: 94\u00b0C for 20 seconds, 50\u00b0C for 20 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds using a DNA Engine PTC200 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, Massachusetts). QIAquick 96 PCR purifi cation cartridges (Qiagen; with modifi ed binding and wash buffers) were used to separate amplifi cation products from unused primers. Masscode tags were decoupled from amplifi ed products through UV light-induced photolysis in a fl ow cell and analyzed in a single quadrapole mass spectrometer using positive-mode atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California ).",

            "text": "The majority of the acute diarrheal illnesses were attributed to Campylobacter . The most likely source of this pathogen was from ingestion of contaminated food obtained from the local \"cafeterias\" situated adjacent to the Crow Valley camps. Of the personnel who experienced diarrhea, 9/10 (90%) reported having eaten food from the local \"cafeterias.\" This observation is similar to other studies that correlate an increase in the incidence of diarrhea with an increase in time spent off-base, suggesting increased exposure and consumption of locally prepared food and drinks. 6 Although the number of cases was small, 5 of the 7 Campylobacter cases occurred on the 5th day after the start of the exercise, which most likely refl ected the incubation period of the pathogen after initial exposure. Given the relatively short duration of the exercise, some individuals who were infected with an enteric pathogen may not have exhibited symptoms until after the conclusion of the military exercise and thus would not have been captured by the surveillance. Therefore, there may have been more cases than were actually captured. Surveillance continued for at least 1 week after the military exercises may have given a somewhat more complete picture of infectious disease incidence and etiology. 22 The information gathered from this laboratory-based surveillance program could potentially be useful during future exercises to decrease morbidity from diarrheal illness. For example, providing food sanitation training to local vendors and/or restricting access to locally purchased food could potentially decrease the number of diarrheal illnesses. Sensitizing medical staff at the BAS to etiologies of acute diarrhea may allow for more targeted counseling and treatment of military personnel. The fact that 8 of the 10 diarrheal cases were positive by PCR for some enteric pathogen indicates that under the conditions of this surveillance, PCR testing on frozen stool specimens from the fi eld is a viable approach to identifying etiological enteric agents. The limitation of this approach is that culture and, therefore, sensitivities of the pathogens are not available. However, in certain situations, maintaining frozen specimens may present a viable and feasible alternative to attempting to culture enteric pathogens within a prescribed time frame. In terms of the respiratory cases, all the nasal specimens that were collected were negative for infl uenza by PCR testing. A likely explanation is that the military exercise occurred in the summer months and the infl uenza virus was not actively circulating among the military personnel or in people within the camp vicinity during that period. However, 4 out of 6 respiratory specimens were positive for H. infl uenzae , which suggests that this pathogen was a signifi cant cause of morbidity during this deployment. The application of an advanced multiplex laboratory assay such as MassTag on samples collected and frozen on-site was able to reveal potentially useful public health information. The lack of infl uenza cases in this exercise certainly does not preclude the potential impact of an outbreak of infl uenza under different circumstances.",

Testing using advanced techniques such as PCR and MassTag of frozen diarrheal and respiratory specimens obtained under certain conditions may be used to identify enteric and respiratory pathogen threats in deployed military personnel. Development and testing of rapid and forward-based diagnostic tests for respiratory and diarrheal diseases, which can be deployed in fi eld settings, is also recommended.",
