The presence of infectious agents in the blood supply, for example, has had -and could again have -a profound influence on the safe use of both blood and blood-derived products in the care of patients with haemophilia. This article provides an overview of emerging infectious diseases in general and discusses some examples of viral pathogens that are currently cause for concern, including West Nile virus (WNV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza. It also lays the foundation for discussions about the implications of emerging infectious diseases for the safety of the blood supply and for the care of patients who depend on the safety of the blood supply, such as those with haemophilia.",

Outbreaks of disease once thought to be well controlled may be associated with a breakdown in core public health measures such as treatment of established infection (e.g. tuberculosis) or routine childhood immunizations (poliomyelitis) The continuum of potential disease threats also includes new antimicrobialresistant forms of established pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

International travel and commerce have affected the size and mobility of human populations, bringing some environments, humans and other animal species into contact with each other for the first time. These changing human demographics may enable an infectious agent to become adapted to and disseminated within a new host population, often resulting in an expansion of the agent's geographic range [5] .

In the case of SARS, patients can be screened, but the exact mode of human-to-human transmission remains uncertain. In contrast, reasonably (although not universally) effective screening exists for some newly described blood-borne pathogens such as WNV. Nonetheless, the hard-learned lesson from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) experience in the 1980s is that the importance of vigilance in the detection and elimination of newly recognized threats to blood safety cannot be overstressed. For these reasons, emerging pathogens will continue to be a reality requiring the best efforts of both public health officials and individual healthcare providers worldwide to identify emerging pathogens in a timely fashion, contain outbreaks and prevent transmission.",
