However, a looming global health workforce (HWF) shortage of 18 million by 2030, predominantly in low-and middle-income countries [1] is a serious threat. The deficit is traced to inadequate production capacity on the part of health professions education institutions, coupled with budgetary restrictions for employment and rapid attrition of existing health workers through migration and retirements [3] [4] [5] [6] . It is thus estimated that more than half of some US$3.9 trillion needed in health investments by 2030 must be in HWF education and employment [7] . Although this demonstrates the centrality of the HWF in global health goals, chronic underinvestment continues to be a drawback, and it is linked to defective and ad-hoc HWF planning [1, 8, 9] , which is a part of, and cannot be delinked from, the overall health service planning [10] .",

There are several approaches with varied conceptual underpinnings for this analysis. Some are based on the observed levels of health service utilisation (service demand); health services targets; number and size of health facilities (health facilities staffing norms); simple population ratios; and population health needs (or epidemiological approach). Several texts examine each of these approaches in depth [see, for example, [14, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] ]. Although each method has its merits and downsides, and none has been explicitly shown to be superior in all contexts, the needs-based approach to health workforce planning has a strong instinctive appeal in line with the UHC efforts. For instance, the World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted resolution WHA69. 19 in 2016 which profoundly urged countries to make a paradigm shift in health workforce planning toward matching ' . . . the supply of health workers to population needs, now and in the future' [1] .",

Thus, it can be assumed that the population in any jurisdiction has a specific need for health services whether or not they have demanded it and can afford it [14] . Therefore, to estimate the optimal need for health professionals, one would, first have to model the population's need for health services [28] . Building on the conceptual framework proposed by Birch and colleagues [35] , the population's need for health services is a function of three main drivers: (a) The size of the population and its demographic characteristics; (b) the state of health or level of health of the population; and (c) the level of services (type and frequency) that is planned or otherwise necessary to attain and maintain optimal health by the population. The interaction between these variables determines the population's 'Need for Health Services'.",

Whereas previous models implicitly used a constant rate of disease prevalence (level of health) from the baseline to extrapolate into the future, this model makes adjustments for the expected rate of change over time in the population's level of health. In one review, Murphy et al. [17] noted that there were ' . . . no documents [health workforce plans] that modelled the impacts of changes in [population] needs and potential associated changes . . . in terms of their impacts on HRH requirements' (p. 6). This represents a significant limitation in previous works which this model attempts to address in determining the future need for health services and ultimately the needs-based health workforce requirements. The need for health services can then be translated into the health workforce requirements if the category of health professional competent to deliver the service is identified [30] with clear work division [29] , and a measure of their productivity is established [27, 28] .",

The standard workload is, in turn, a function of the available working time of the health professional and the service standard (the amount of time necessary to deliver the given service task within professionally acceptable standards in the jurisdiction or based on service delivery protocols). When the need for health services (the evidence-based health service requirement) is compared with (divided by) the standard workload, the need-based health workforce requirements is established but only for services that can be counted or measured per person. To account for the support or catalytic activities that are undertaken by health workers to enhance the delivery of direct patient/person care, the estimated requirement has to be adjusted for these activities.",

The model recognises that not all the active stock (those qualified and with a valid license to practice) will find or take up jobs at frontline service delivery areas.

Within the overall stock (registered), those that maintain good standing with the professional regulatory body by renewing their licenses, are considered the professionally active stock-some of whom may be engaged in other career interests (such as teaching, research and policy) rather than direct health service delivery. Out of the professionally active stock, those that are engaged in (or are willing to find jobs to be engaged in) direct health service delivery are considered the practising stock of health workers. The interest in health service planning is to estimate as close as possible, the current and future stock of the practising health workforce. We modelled the supply using a stock and flow process [29, 39] as represented in Figure 1 and illustrated in the following equation: S n,t = [T n,t\u22121 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 a n ) + I n ] \u00d7 P",

The standard workload is defined as the amount of work of a particular service delivery task that one health professional who is well trained could perform in a year if the health professional dedicated all his/her working to delivering that service [37] . It is a function of two components: (a) The service standard (SS) for the activity to be performed-the average time that a well-trained and motivated health professional will spend to perform the service delivery activity to acceptable professional standards in the context of the jurisdiction; and (b) the available working time (AWT)-the time a health worker was available in one year to do his/her work, taking into account all absences.

[29] , needs-based models recognise that health workers spend some time performing the activities that are essential for supporting the delivery of direct patient/person services, but such activities are not linked to individual patients/clients. While the previous needs-based models accounted for the phenomenon from a supply perspective by defining and adjusting health workforce supply by activity rates (the proportion of health worker's time spent on direct care) [29] , we take the view that for planning, it is appropriate to estimate the number of health professionals needed to cover such support activities that are catalytic for the direct patient care. For example, the process of handing over from one group of nurses in a shift to another group is a crucial component for continuity of care, but because the activity may not necessarily be counted per patient, it could be ignored in needs-based models. Leveraging on the WISN methodology [37] , we define a support allowance standard (SAS) as the proportion of a health worker's time that is spent on the support (or indirect patient care) activities. When the total SAS (in a proportion) is subtracted from the whole, the difference represents a proportion of the health worker's AWT that is devoted to direct patient/person services [37] . To incorporate the SAS into Equation (4), an adjustment factor known as the support activities adjustment factor (SAAF) is defined-mathematically expressed as the inverse of the proportion of a health professional time left for direct per person care activities [37] .

Table 3 . Gap analysis between needs-based requirements and anticipated supply. For obstetricians/gynaecologists, the simulation shows that the needs-based requirement far exceeds that of the anticipated supply throughout the horizon of the projection. As shown in Table 3 , the needs-based shortage of obstetrician/gynaecologist specialist is about 534 in 2020, which could reach 599 by 2030 if there is no new intervention to increase the rate of supply or decrease the need or both. The SAR for obstetrician/gynaecologist is a paltry 26.1% in 2020, which is expected to improve to 36.7% by 2025 and 40.9% by 2030. Therefore, under the assumption of maintaining the current rate of production, the model suggests a needs-based shortage of obstetricians/gynaecologists by 74% in 2020 which may only reduce by 15 percentage points to 59% by 2030 (see Table 3 ).",

Thus, from the health profession education perspective, scaling up the training of midwives may not be warranted beyond the current rate of production. Efforts in the production of midwives could, therefore, be focused on improving the quality rather than further quantitative expansion. On the other hand, the massive needs-based shortage of obstetrician/gynaecologist signals the need to ramp up training by some 599 within the next ten years in addition to the current rate of production. Thus, roughly 60 obstetrician/gynaecologist must be produced per year in addition to the current rate of production. Given that enrolments into specialist medical education such as obstetrician/gynaecologist are drawn from the existing stock of general medical practitioners, it will have a knock-on effect on the need to scale up the training of general practitioners too.",

The SAR for obstetrician/gynaecologist then becomes 28.4% in 2020 (versus 26.1% with the assumption kept) which increases to 50.1% in 2030 (versus 40.9% with the assumption kept). Similarly, the SAR for midwives without the assumption in 2020 is 75.1%, compared with 72.5% when the assumption is kept. Without the assumption, SAR for midwives by 2030 is estimated to be 119.7% as compared to 101.9% when the assumption is kept. From the foregoing, therefore, the further into the future the needs-based projection is made, the more sensitive the results become to the assumption of applying an instantaneous rate of change in the health status of the population. Support activities adjustment factor: using available data from previous work in Ghana [56] , it was estimated in the applied example that two support activities of midwives together consume about 17.5% of their available working time. Similarly, the obstetrician/gynaecologist spends about 6 h per week on clinical meetings and capacity building seminars which represents 15% of the available working time. These translate into support activities adjustment of 21.2% and 17.6% of the needs-based requirements for midwives and obstetrician/gynaecologist, respectively (see Table 5 ). Exploring the impact of practice variations and standard workloads: The WISN activity standards in Ghana which was adopted for the applied example had a different set of standard time for accomplishing similar tasks between midwives in primary care health facilities (district hospitals, polyclinics, health centres and CHPS) and secondary/tertiary health facilities. These differences stem from variations in clinical protocols between primary care and tertiary health facilities; and differences in available technology and resources. In the base analysis, the activity standards in the primary care facilities were used since that represents more than 95% of health facilities in Ghana [57] . We explored the potential impact on the model output if the tertiary health facilities standard time (activity standards) were used. As illustrated in Figure 4 , the results show that the effect of using the tertiary facilities' standard time is about 20.3% increase in the needs-based requirements for midwives but weans marginally to 19.3% by 2030. Under this scenario, there will be a needs-based shortage of midwives of 7875 (compared to 4532 in the base case) in 2020. Under this alternative analysis, the staff availability ratio for midwives will be 60.2% in 2020 (versus 72.5% in the base estimation) and 85.4% in 2030 (compared with 101.9% in the base estimation). As shown in previous needs-based models, this finding tends to validate the suggestion that needs-based analysis is highly sensitive to the measures of productivity chosen [25, 58] , the setting and that of practice variations [27] as well as changing health technology are essential factors to consider in long-term health workforce planning. of standard time for accomplishing similar tasks between midwives in primary care health facilities (district hospitals, polyclinics, health centres and CHPS) and secondary/tertiary health facilities.

In addition, different from previous ones, a measure of productivity was incorporated using the concept of standard workload, which can be directly elicited from health professionals based on the average time they spend in delivering various health service activities. Thus, the model presented in this paper represents a critical and much-needed improvement in the empirical framework for the application of the needbased approach. The World Health Organisation has provided a wealth of description and guidance on the conditions necessary, and how to apply the different HWF modelling approaches [19, 24] . However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no dynamic open-access, ready-to-use tools for health planners and human resource practitioners to easily apply the needs-based framework in real-life health workforce planning, especially in the context of low-and-middle-income countries, where the analytical capacity to develop sophisticated models locally is often limited. To bridge this gap and facilitate policy-driven uptake of the needs-based approach to health workforce planning, an easy-to-use, open-access simulation tool developed in Microsoft \u00ae Excel has been made available as supplementary material 1.",

To account for this assumption, we incorporated an instantaneous rate of change in the population need for health services. Murphy et al. [17] lamented that the needs-based models reviewed failed to take this into account, which represented a significant limitation. Our applied simulation shows that the impact of this assumption on the outcome of needs-based projection is more pronounced, and further into the future the projection is extended. For example, when this assumption was relaxed in our applied example, and a fixed level of health was applied throughout the horizon of the projection (as used in previous models), the needs-based requirements for midwives decreased by up to 17.4%, and that of obstetrician/gynaecologist decreased by up to 23% over the ten years. However, in the base year, the difference was only 3.5% for midwives and 8.8% for obstetrician/gynaecologist. Therefore, not explicitly incorporating the assumption in the empirical framework could result in a substantial underestimation of the actual need for health professionals if longer-term planning is desired. For a one-time point (or static) analysis, the underestimation seems to be minimal and could be within reasonable planning limits, but for dynamic or longer-term analysis, it becomes imperative to take this assumption into account.",

Instead, some models defined a clinical focus term in the supply side of the analysis to adjust the anticipated supply to take into consideration only the proportion of time health professionals spent on direct clinical activities. It is our considered view that the support activities of health professionals are not a supply-side issue, for which reason it ought to be accounted for in the needs-based requirements to enable planning for the numbers needed to cover such support activities. For example, our applied simulation shows that 21% of the estimated requirement for midwives, and 18% for obstetrician/gynaecologist were needed to cover for support activities. Incorporating these assumptions in the needs-based estimates is necessary to inform planning for health professions education and employment to cover for both direct patient/person care and the support activities that catalyse direct care.",

Compared to the current estimate of 16,462 midwives needed in 2020 and 19,409 in 2025, the current model estimated 21.45% higher needs in 2020, but the two estimates converge towards 2025 with a variance of only 3.06%. Thus, despite the conceptual differences between the staffing norms and the needs-based approach, the medium-to-longer-term estimates seem to draw a similar conclusion from both approaches in this case of the midwives in Ghana. Furthermore, an administrative analysis of the Ghana Health Service suggested that the production of midwives is at the brink of exceeding the demand [62] , whose direction of evidence tends to corroborate with our applied simulation for midwives.",

Nevertheless, it was previously estimated that Ghana required 750 obstetrician/gynaecologist in 2020 (compared with 723 in the current estimation) and 1044 by 2025 (compared with 854 in the current estimation).

The present model partly addresses the latter but also requires extensive data on population size, demographic characteristics, the range of disease burden, health workforce absences and service delivery standards as well as data on the existing stock of health professionals, attrition rates, annual enrolments, pass rates and labour participation rates. Some of these data needs may not be routinely available in many low-and middle-income countries. However, as repeatedly put forward by Tomblin Murphy, Birch and colleagues [17, 29, 63] , an imprecise estimation of health workforce requirements, based on appropriate conceptual underpinnings with the view of progressive improvement in the data adequacy and quality, is more useful than using conceptually invalid models. Cometto and colleagues [64] admonish that health workforce planning is an inexact science; hence the potential impact of data imprecision and uncertainty should always be taken into account. The present simulation model provides an opportunity to explore the impact of data uncertainty on the model needs-based estimates in the form of best and worst cases scenarios. With many countries striving to improve their health workforce data availability and quality through the implementation of the national health workforce account [38, 65] , the use of needs-based models could become less burdensome and easy to use than first thought.",

A real-life example using maternal and new-born care in Ghana is included to demonstrate the value and how the model works. A sensitivity analysis based on the applied example demonstrated that without explicitly incorporating the assumption of a changing future population health status (and need) in the empirical framework could have resulted in a substantial underestimation of the actual need for health professionals in the longer term by up to 17.4% for midwives and 23% for obstetrician/gynaecologist. Also, the simulation results were sensitive to practice variations between primary care facilities and tertiary health facilities by up to 20.3% for midwives. When support activities were considered, the need for midwives and obstetrician/gynaecologist was 21% and 18% respectively higher than if the support activities were not taken into consideration. ",
