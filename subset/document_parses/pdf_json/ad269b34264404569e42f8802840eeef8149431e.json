Young calves mainly shed Cryptosporidium parvum, which has a wide host range and is potentially zoonotic. Clinical infection in calves is characterized by non-specific diarrhea, dehydration, depression, anorexia and abdominal pain. In most calves, diarrhea starts 3-5 days postinfection and lasts from 4 to 17 days (de Graaf et al., 1999) . Oocyst shedding begins at 4 days after birth and peaks at 7-18 days, decreasing after 3 weeks (Nydam et al., 2001; Trotz-Williams et al., 2007) . Higher oocyst shedding is frequently seen during episodes of diarrhea (Xiao and Herd, 1994; McCluskey et al., 1995) . Despite much endeavor in the development of effective drugs, halofuginone lactate (HL) is the only drug registered in Europe to treat cryptosporidiosis in cattle.

Previous studies have indicated that cryptosporidiosis may occur more frequently in dairy calves than in beef calves because the former are born throughout the year and are confined to pens or hutches, which can facilitate a high level of yearround transmission (Olson et al., 2004) . Other factors linked to passive immunity of the calf and management of large herds may also be relevant (O'Handley, 2007) . Several factors have been identified as significant in increasing the risk of shedding Cryptosporidium oocysts by dairy calves. Most studies have focused on factors associated with management of the herd, and attempted to resolve these issues by presenting a questionnaire to farmers (e.g., Garber et al., 1994; Mohammed et al., 1999; Trotz-Williams et al., 2007; Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2009b) . Significant risk factors may differ from survey to survey, indicating that different epidemiological practices may need to be adopted on different farms. Epidemiological data for dairy calf cryptosporidiosis in France is scarce, and there are no risk factor analysis. The first surveys in France underlined the importance of Cryptosporidium in neonatal diarrhea and reported that the prevalence of oocyst shedding ranged from 17.9% to 43.4%, depending on the sampling regime (Naciri et al., 1999; Lefay et al., 2000) .

Among them, the use of buckets without teats to feed young calves increases the risk of oocyst shedding. A plausible explanation could be that the walls of the buckets are highly contaminated by oocysts, which could occur when farmers stack them for storage. These oocysts are probably not removed by standard washing procedures and may contaminate subsequent food placed in the buckets. An alternative explanation could be the failure to satisfy the calves' need for suckling in those that are quickly separated from their dams and fed using buckets without teats. This separation may lead calves to suckle another calf (cross-suckling), or other points in their housing area or environment, thereby ingesting oocysts that cause early and repeated infection. A study investigating the effect of teat feeding on cross-suckling in dairy calves reported that teat feeding reduces cross-suckling compared to calves fed from buckets (Jensen and Budde, 2006) . Finally, teat feeding allows a more effective reflex closure of the esophageal groove than feeding from the bucket, which probably prevents fermentation and limits colonization by enteropathogens such as C. parvum (Ferran and Bouquet, 2013) .

A review of the effects of HL on calf cryptosporidiosis using a meta-analysis (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2009a) found that for prophylactic treatment, HL has a slight protective effect on infection and diarrhea prevalence on days 4 and 7 post administration. In a recent randomized controlled field trial, the halofuginone group showed a longer prepatent period than the control, although there was no difference in the number of oocysts shed (Almawly et al., 2013) . Other studies have reported a significant reduction in the shedding of oocysts and diarrhea by HL-treated newborn calves (Klein, 2008; de Waele et al., 2010; Trotz-Williams et al., 2011; Keidel and Daugschies, 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 161, "end": 186, "text": "(Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2009a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 518, "end": 540, "text": "(Almawly et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 664, "end": 677, "text": "(Klein, 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 678, "end": 700, "text": "de Waele et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 701, "end": 729, "text": "Trotz-Williams et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 730, "end": 758, "text": "Keidel and Daugschies, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Supplementation with fermented milk appeared to be a protective factor against the shedding of C. parvum. Fermented milk contains more probiotics (e.g., Lactobacillus sp.) than unfermented milk, and, through their modifying activities, these beneficial bacteria are able to prevent pathogens from colonizing and multiplying. Supplementation of feed with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus reuteri in mice and rats reduces fecal shedding of C. parvum oocysts (Alak et al., 1999; Guitard et al., 2006) . Another study reported that the oral administration of fermented milk supplemented with two probiotic strains significantly increased delayed-type hypersensitivity, plaque-forming cells and half-hemolysis values in healthy adult mice. Synbiotic fermented milk may help improve intestinal health and have a positive effect on the humoral and cell-mediated immunity of host animals (Wang et al., 2012) . Similarly, lactic acid bacteria isolated from the calf gut inhibit those causing diarrhea in calves (Maldonado et al., 2012) .
