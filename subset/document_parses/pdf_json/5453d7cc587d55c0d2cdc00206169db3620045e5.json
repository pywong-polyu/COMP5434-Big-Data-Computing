This online cross-sectional research was conducted using a mobile health application. Overall, 1,032 local residents who participated in the mobile healthcare program of a public health center were classified as being from either urban (n = 481, 46.6%) or rural areas (n = 551, 53.4%) for the purpose of this study. The Walkability Checklist, which includes sociodemographic information, was employed using a Chi-square test and a multivariate logistic regression to investigate whether or not the participants were satisfied with the environmental factors associated with walking. It was found that both urban and rural areas were more likely to be unsatisfied with walking comfort (adjusted OR: 24.472, 95% CI: 14.937-40.096). Regarding the walking comfort aspects of the walking environment, urban residents chose poor landscape (\"needed more grass, flowers, or trees\"; aOR: 13.561, 95% CI: 3.619-50.823) as their primary dissatisfaction, and rural residents chose messy streets (\"dirty, lots of litter or trash\"; aOR: 29.045, 95% CI: 6.202-136.015). Compared with urban residents, rural residents were more discontented with the walking environment. Thus, to promote walking activities at the community level, it is necessary to focus on walking comfort, and implement efforts related to environmental beautification.",

Physical activities, such as flexibility, strength training, and walking, improve physical and mental health, reduce risk factors for chronic diseases, play an important role in body maintenance, and impact the quality of life of individuals [2] . Physical activities not only have a positive effect on disease prevention but are also highly related to national healthcare expenditures [3] . Physical activity is a significant strategy that can decrease the health problems of the elderly population, and regular practice can help them to be healthy, thus lessening the medical use rate and care cost [4, 5] . On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (COVID-19) [6] . During the COVID-19 lockdown, restrictions on private gatherings, transportation, and industrial activities were put in place. Necessary methods such as social distancing and quarantine that limited physical activity and contact with numerous people, were implemented to prevent its spread [7] . It was under the influence of these limited activities that a reduced concentration of outdoor air pollutants was found [8] [9] [10] [11] . Walking is a typical physical activity that can be performed in such a situation while maintaining social distance. Walking is a low-intensity aerobic exercise with a low injury rate. It can be performed spontaneously anytime, anywhere, without any special equipment. Furthermore, since it has a low musculoskeletal burden, it can be applied to various age groups and is recommended for weight management purposes such as aerobic capacity [12] , body composition, reduction of high blood pressure and blood lipid levels, and obesity [13] . Performing physical activities, such as walking for disease prevention, is important in chronic disease treatment that protects the immune system, and the facilitation of an appropriate response to the treatment of COVID-19 [14, 15] .",

Core physical activity programs for the community include infrastructure building, supportive environment provision, community campaigns, health promotion education and public relations, physical activity programs for the elderly and obese, and exercise prescription programs [17] . Despite these efforts, the walking practice rate in Korea is only 42.6% for men and 37.1% for women, and demonstrates a downward trend [18] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, participation in walking activities has fluctuated according to the increase and decrease in COVID-19 cases, but it has not reached prior participation rates [19] .

The purpose of this program is to prevent chronic diseases and improve the health management ability of participants by changing their health behavior. A program team composed of various field experts provided individual integrated health promotion services. All study participants were people who actively partook in walking activities around their residential areas. They used a health app called Walk-On (Swallaby Inc., Republic of Korea) and their participation was voluntary. The survey was initiated with the consent of the Gangwon Provincial Office and public health centers in Gangwon-do. Prior to the initiation of the study, the research participants consented to the provision and use of personal information and were provided with sufficient explanation about the research contents. Additionally, contents that could identify individuals were excluded from the survey questions. Those wishing to participate in the survey were asked to \"start the survey\" by entering their date of birth, thus confirming that they fully understand the contents of the survey and agree to participate.

The responses for these four major factors were collected on the basis of a five-point Likert scale (where 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 represented absolutely not, no, neutral, yes, and very much, respectively). To divide these answers into satisfaction or dissatisfaction, we recategorized 1, 2, and 3 as dissatisfied and 4 and 5 as satisfied. If the participant's response was that of dissatisfaction in \"Was your walk pleasant?\", duplication of the response may be allowed as the cause of dissatisfaction. The responses to six representative problems (\"needed more grass, flowers, or trees,\" \"not well-lit,\" \"dirty, lots of litter or trash,\" \"unclean air due to automobile exhausts,\" \"scary people,\" and \"frightening dogs or other threats\") were extracted from the walking comfort-related issues in the Walkability Checklist. Although the Walkability Checklist is limited by its low predictive validity, it is possible to identify problems between various components through the evaluation of actual users [21] .",

Using a structured checklist, satisfaction levels related to various aspects associated to the walking environment were identified, and their relative proportion to the factors of dissatisfaction was confirmed. Consequently, the research confirmed that compared to urban areas, rural areas were more likely to be discontented with environmental factors related to walking activities. Regarding walking comfort, \"dirty, lots of litter or trash\" was a source of displeasure that had the most influence on the overall dissatisfaction with the walking environment. Regular physical activity must be encouraged for people to help them maintain a healthy immune system and bodily functions during unstable circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic [23] . From this perspective, walking exercises that can be performed while maintaining social distance should be further recommended, and various interventions to promote them should be implemented. Therefore, it is necessary to select an effective strategic plan despite limited financial resources and find the most effective method. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in positive environmental benefits due to restrictions on various industrial activities and transportation [9] . The reduction of environmental pollutants prompted a more pleasant outdoor environment [8, 10, 11] . In these circumstances, maintaining social distance and actively performing physical activity can provide reasonable health benefits. Health authorities need to encourage physical activities like walking, and monitor changes in the levels of environmental pollution. This study found that the proportion of dissatisfaction with all walking-related environmental factors was higher in rural residents. People living in rural regions are generally older and have lower income and education levels than those in urban areas, which can lead to differences in their health-related physical activity performance [24] . Therefore, it becomes more challenging for the former to perform physical activities, including walking, because their walking environment is poorly established. These residents can be physically active when a safe and accessible walking environment is created around their residential area [25] . Therefore, for rural areas, strategies to enhance walking conditions, secure pedestrian stability, and provide walking comfort that centers on residential areas, should be proposed to reduce the gap with urban areas. For both urban and rural regions, over half of the respondents reported their dissatisfaction with \"driver's consideration for pedestrians,\" which thus confirmed the need for education regarding drivers' concern toward walkers, and an increase of fines.",

Specifically, people with high income levels and those living outside the city tended to walk relatively long distances for recreational purposes [27] . A study conducted in Minneapolis-Saint Paul showed that people walk longer distances for recreational and exercise purposes than for other purposes [28] . From these findings, it can be inferred that the promotion of walking activity should focus on the provision of sufficient recreation rather than the simple replacement of the means of transportation for the purpose of moving. Thus, providing a comfortable walking environment is an effective way to increase pedestrian satisfaction. Environmental factors directly impact the likelihood of the performance of physical activities [29, 30] . Specifically, \"dirty, lots of litter or trash\" was the greatest element of dissatisfaction with the walking environment. It is necessary to prioritize the improvement of the pedestrian environment and keep the pedestrian path clean. In the case of urban areas, it showed a high correlation with \"needed more grass, flowers, or trees\"; hence, in these regions, environmental beautification and financial investment to enhance aesthetics will provide motivation for the conduction of walking activities. Additionally, the absence of walking companions lowers participation in such exercises [31] . Thus, social environment support, such as a walking club, should be provided.",
