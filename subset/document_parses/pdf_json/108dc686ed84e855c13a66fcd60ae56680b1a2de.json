Like the rest of the world, the Philippines has been greatly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and we argue that a stable and robust NR is needed to bounce back from the challenges and adversities of the crisis. This pioneering study on NR in Filipino adults was conducted to achieve two aims (1) assess the psychometric properties of the Filipino adapted National Resilience Scale (NRS-Filipino) and (2) determine demographic and psychological variables that influence NR. Data from 401 participants yielded an exploratory factor analysis with a good model fit for a four-factor solution that is similar to the original National Resilience Assessment Scale.

To fill this gap, Kimhi, Eshel, Lahad, and Leykin (2019) investigated the psychometric properties of the 25-item NRAS using data from Jewish Israeli adults. Findings of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) indicated that 24 items clustered into four distinct yet somewhat related factors: identifying with the state, solidarity and social justice (SSJ), trust in national institutions, and trust in public justice. The reliability of the NRAS was strong, which was replicated in a cross-cultural study (Kimhi et al., 2018) that included student samples from Australia, Germany, Great Britain, Israel, and Greece.",

Hibbing, Smith, and Alford (2014) described individuals with conservative or right-wing political orientation as more responsive and attuned to negative stimuli such as the threat of the current health pandemic, and there seems to be an emerging pattern on the influence of political ideology on coronavirus pandemic. Similar to the Philippines, a recent study by Dryhurst, Schneider, Kerr, and van der Linden (2020) indicated that people from the United Kingdom and the United States that lean more to conservative political orientation reported a lower risk of the coronavirus crisis.",

Specifically, we found that participants who felt more distressed, higher perceived threat, and aware of person(s) infected with coronavirus within the community reported lower levels of perceived NR. However, a sense of danger was not associated with NR. Earlier studies provided support that greater distress (Eshel et al., 2020; and perceived threat (Canetti et al., 2014) were associated with lower levels of perceived NR. Anxiety and distress are normal responses to such extreme circumstances of the coronavirus crisis. Our stress systems have evolved to respond in highly adaptive ways, thereby enabling humans to deal with these challenges (de Kloet, Sibug, Helmerhorst, & Schmidt, 2005) . It is possible that participants' negative feelings may have been affected by their knowledge of someone with COVID-19 illness within one's local community. Such emotional experience also can be explained by construal-level of psychological distance (Trope & Liberman, 2010) However, the present findings did not find support for the hypothesis that a sense of danger could have a significant negative influence on NR. One possible explanation is that the survey was conducted during the first 2-3 weeks of lockdown in the Philippines when there were only a few confirmed cases of coronavirus mostly in highly dense areas like Metro Manila; thus, sense of danger of the coronavirus crisis may not have been widespread and to a high degree. Findings may have been different if participants' sense of danger on the coronavirus crisis was assessed later during the lockdown with a possible surge of cases. For example, the study of Eshel and Kimhi (2016a , 2016b , 2016c showed that sense of danger was associated with NR following a disaster such as a missile attack.",

Since NR may be viewed as a collection of resilient individuals and communities, it is not surprising that Filipinos who perceive their local community as resilient would believe that the Philippine society, in general, may be capable to effectively withstand the coronavirus crisis. It is possible that since the response of one's local community during the coronavirus crisis (e.g., strict implementation of lockdown by local authorities, distribution of relief goods, and cash) has been relatively quick and directly observable, people tend to generalize these as indicators of effective management at the national level. Likewise, right-wing political attitude as a significant antecedent of NR explains the importance of trust in the political system during an intractable crisis such as the coronavirus pandemic.",
