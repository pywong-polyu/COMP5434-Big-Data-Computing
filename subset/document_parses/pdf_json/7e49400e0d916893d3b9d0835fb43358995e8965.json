In our analysis, this was true in men but not in women. Sex-related differences in the clinical presentation, course and outcomes of disease are well recognised in certain medical specialties [6] . The potential for sex differences in critically ill patients with sepsis is starkly illustrated by data from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the RECOVERY trial that examined the effect of dexamethasone on patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 36% of the recruited patients were women but only 27% of mechanically ventilated patients were women [7] . This raises important considerations for interpretation of results, where women and men may be more or less likely to acquire severe forms of disease and where treatment effects are dependent on disease severity, true effects in women and men may be masked if sex-disaggregated analyses are not performed in the appropriate subgroups.",
