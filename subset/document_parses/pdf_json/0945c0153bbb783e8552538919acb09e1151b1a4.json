Within the region, the survival of small states can no longer be taken for granted and power relations are conflictual. The hegemonic ambitions of larger regional state actors draw small states into a contested orbit and emphasize the fluidity of pre-existing notions of the balance of power. This has led to forms of fragmentation. Small states can no longer sit comfortably under the shelter of regional and even external super-powers. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small states like Kuwait and Qatar is a useful prism to examine the ways in which such small states attempt to project power and sovereignty through their diplomatic responses. Our argument, here, is that such discourse is framed as part of an ideational and material construct for state resilience within a regional and international system that is perceived as predatory. Yet pandemic politics reveals both the opportunities and limits of such approaches.",

Historically, this has made both countries vulnerable to the power-struggles between such states as they seek to dominate the region. In early 2020, such power politics were evident in the ongoing effects of increased tensions centred on Iran.",

In 1991, in the wake of the Iraqi invasion and occupation of their country, as well as accompanying plunder of their resources, Kuwait's ruling elite had experienced a painful lesson in vulnerability and dependence. One consequence of the American-led coalition to liberate Kuwait was the rise of domestic opposition groups in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Foreign policy began to reflect this duality of vulnerability and dependence as well as a rising sovereign assertion of Kuwaiti agency. For Kuwait, in particular, this was symbolized in its attachment to the coalition of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Kuwait and Qatar, along with other small states including the UAE and Oman, had attempted to cooperate to place constraints on the agenda of Saudi Arabia in its pursuit of domination of the Gulf regional order. Saudi Arabia's control was seen as part of the natural regional order because the state is the largest Sunni oil producing monarchy in the area.",

Contrary to expectation \"smallness\" was no impediment to a newly emergent trend of active foreign policy across the Middle East and North Africa region. This high level of activity from Gulf states was disruptive to dimensions of regional order that were already in significant upheaval or threat. Active foreign policy by a number of small states, including Qatar, was multi-dimensional and evident in diplomacy, peace-making, humanitarian efforts, support and advocacy for mobilized populations, armed actors, and defensive power holders as well as new power contenders. In some spheres of the Middle East and North Africa, small Gulf countries were standing shoulder to shoulder but in others they were on opposite sides of political divides. This new political environment also established greater agency and autonomy from the traditional consensus of regional leadership determined by Saudi Arabia. For its part, Saudi Arabia actively sought to preserve itself from any threat perceived as inherent within the populist risings and emergent political forces, including the sectarian ambitions of Iran in Arab states, as well as the Muslim Brotherhood, in the region.",

The truism that the COVID-19 virus recognized no borders, religions or ethnicities has been evident in its designation as a global pandemic and the threat it has posed to the stability, prosperity and effectiveness of governance in the region and beyond. The countries of the Gulf have thus not only contended with domestic challenges but part of responsiveness is clearly found in foreign policy activities. We thus commence this paper by analysing the literature on small states and niche diplomacy to assess the evolution of the concept in international relations literature. By examining Kuwait's and Qatar's approaches to foreign policy in the initial stages of the COVID-19 crisis, which we coin \"mask diplomacy\", we are afforded an opportunity to highlight the theoretical parameters and boundaries at work. We argue that, despite similar approaches to convert forms of small state power, the limits of niche diplomacy was reached in how both countries set or tailored their foreign policy agendas in this period.",

Theoretical frames have traditionally focused on the state and developing discourse reflected in realist narratives on power within the international system. Within such conceptions, state power was determined by size with inherent assumptions reinforced throughout the Cold War that big states would dominate world order and small states would remain much more subject and lacking in agency. This highlights what Steinmetz and Wivel call 'the focus from the power that states possess to the power that they exercise' (p. 7). Given the inherent symbiosis between power and size differentials at work, the notion that small states somehow constituted forms of diminished sovereignty entered normative discourse. Fox reinforces this by contending that within the international system small states can never leverage power in the way that larger states can. Nor, Fox argues, can they engage in effective opposition to the implementation of power wielded against them by such big states (Fox 1959) .",

Furthermore, as Waltz argues, this lends credence to a structuralist discourse on statehood where, within the international system, 'states are differently placed by their power' and their power status is dependent on size (1991, 31) . Differentials of power diminish, in such discourse, as small states are cast as almost perpetually seeking to attain forms of status akin to big or strong states (Hey 2003) . This dichotomy had implications for the interconnected realms of national interest, security and foreign policy making for small states. Much academic literature has portrayed their vulnerability as fundamental to the ways in which they forged external relationships especially with respect to security sheltering behaviours (Antola 2002) . In the wake of the Cold War, and uncertainty about the transitions within the world order international relations literature re-visited the concept of small states.",

In many respects, there is evidence of cognitive dissonance in relation to a new world order where in fact the majority of states could be classified as small and in many respects have become increasingly powerful.

Such approaches have tended to seek to preserve particular realist frames of the international order where small state power dynamics are deemed insufficient in and of themselves to adjust system norms and behaviours. As such, the exogenous environment is deemed to be far more significant to small states and thus places additional burdens in terms of having foreign policy approaches that establish sufficient defensive capacity so as to ward off the threats posed by larger hegemonic seeking neighbours (Jesse and Dreyer 2016) . Perceptions of small state characteristics are, it can be contended, part of the power projection dynamic of so-called larger or stronger states shaping the appreciation of the role and function of foreign policy (Vital 1971).",

We contend that small states are seen as increasingly resilient through necessary security sheltering bargains that in the case of resource rich states have a transactional character inverting some dimensions of dependency theory.

Nevertheless, the two countries could employ large and growing economic power (derived from hydro-carbon revenues to the state) to leverage particular dimensions of their foreign policy agenda and engage in forms of status and security seeking (Wohlforth et al 2018).

Qatar, according to Fromm, exemplifies positioning by such small states to become indispensable \"bridging\" agents regionally and globally which larger states have a concern to protect (2017). Conceiving and enacting foreign policy approaches that demonstrate this dynamic and autonomous character as a small state has permitted such countries to be perceived as 'punching above their weight.' This has allowed for the crafting of compelling narratives that demonstrate authority within and beyond a regional context that challenges assumptions about power. As such, discourse about the necessary element of dependence in the literature on small states, can, we argue, be appreciated in these contexts as a much more malleable and dynamic phenomenon that hitherto conceived (Henrikson 2001) .",

Discourse addresses effectiveness within foreign policy and emphasizes the 'creative use of diplomatic talents or entrepreneurship' (Cooper 1997, 9) . For small states such as Kuwait or Qatar, the argument that a niche offers a unique launch pad for the construction of narratives and agency around it does appear compelling in seeking to understand how such states amplify their status on the global stage. Cooper seems to account for this by arguing that as such these small countries 'identify and fill niche space on a selective basis through policy ingenuity and execution' (Cooper 1997, 3) . The logic of such an argument appears, however, to be limited in terms of recognizing particular realities around power dynamics, creativity, constraint, capacity and control in small non-liberal and non-democratic states. Nevertheless, authors such as Nye assert that Qatar, for example, exemplifies niche diplomacy and he describes the country as important to a sort of middle ground 'between the West and the Arab mainstream' (Nye 2008) . Such assertions clearly unconsciously perpetuate unhelpful construction and problematic dichotomies between the so-called 'West' and the so-called Arab mainstream rather than carefully advance the discourse on niche diplomacy. As such, it, as Fromm contends, continues to advance niche theory from a 'neorealist tradition' and its attendant assumptions about the post-Cold War world and the international state system (Fromm 2019, 24) .",

In the exogenous realms, these countries are members of an international state system relying on diplomatic, economic, security and other relations where theoretically their status as small states works against their interests and might have disadvantaged them with respect to vaccine procurement, food security, research and development, and international coalition building. Their unique national profiles and small state designation (including how their main sources of state revenue are accrued and how their security in a highly unstable geostrategic context is achieved) means that such states are frequently dependent on a number of primary bilateral relationships with larger and more powerful countries that have been hugely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Both countries, for example, rely on export of hydrocarbons (oil or LNG) to Asian states such as China, the Republic of Korea and Japan, as a primary source of state earnings. Moreover, both countries are also caught on the horns of dependent relationships between the two competing and increasingly rivalrous global powers of China and the USA and the exacerbation of tension between them throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We would argue that an interface of exogenous and endogenous impacts is also reflected in the issue of migrant workers in these contexts (Barbar 2021) .",

It also attempted to build on a narrative of 'preparedness' and a 'reputation for resilience built up during 3 years of blockade imposed on the country by the Arab quartet'. Claims centred on the ongoing abilities of decision-makers in Qatar to quickly organize logistical, humanitarian and medical assistance in times of crisis.

As such, both countries have tended to ignore the fact that under President Trump his government's policies have undermined the sovereignty and power of small states in the Gulf (Bordoff 2020). We would contend that because of the limits of strategic manoeuvre that Kuwait and Qatar have as small states they have to suffer slings and arrows thrown at them resulting from US preference for dealing with bigger states in the region, particularly when negotiating new regional security arrangements. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, small states like Kuwait have been virtually bereft and frequently reminded of the fact that US leadership is absent or unreliable. In the current pandemic, analysts pointed to a marked lack of US leadership on the world stage under Trump and a hope for reassertion under Biden. As the US continues its retreat from the Middle East, we know that other states, including China, Russia and middle powers in the Gulf such as Iran, and Saudi Arabia, will seek to take advantage. Small states have to begin to take account of this change when they make their own security calculations and in also balancing other primary bilateral relationships post-COVID-19.",

Such decision-makers also have to include the risk and vulnerabilities that a post-pandemic event horizon creates in terms of US decision-making, the decline of the socalled American model. This is evident in a variety of ways. Soft power credentials now need to expand and evolve conceptually to include global public health policy, digital nations and economies, the nexus between technological development and international cooperation and the particular strains on small city-states such as Kuwait and Qatar. With healthcare featuring much more prominently in international system policyplanning it can also be contended that R&D is key, especially in relation to medical equipment as well as pharmaceutical patents and production. Even though in the wake of the Blockade on Qatar, local experts highlighted their vulnerabilities in terms of a weak R&D contexts as well as obstacles to manufacturing pharmaceuticals and medically equipment locally the pandemic reveals the extent to which such approaches remained absent from foreign policy priority setting and the nexus to national security.",

The same is true with respect to digital and technology realms, with both countries becoming reliant on remote working digital and technology-based communication and employment. Such dependencies mean that Kuwait and Qatar must be ever-vigilant and double-down on cyber-security threats and protection which in turn necessarily entail relationship building with states such as China. There is already evidence of malign threats in exploitation of the pandemic to target Qatar (Ulrichsen 2020b) . Malware attacks, and sponsored campaigns to exploit the situation through VPN, videoconferencing and software lures have all been deployed to take advantage of the situation and attack. At the level of foreign policy, this means that an assessment of cyber-security cooperation protocols, agreements and mechanisms with other countries as well as choices about preferred providers of next generation (incl. 5G) technologies becomes all the more important. These, however, are under-powered realms in terms of framing narratives and policy approaches and are thus largely absent from the ways in which states like Kuwait promote themselves. It is thus a diplomatic niche that others have filled including small Asian states such as the Republic of South Korea (Won Sonn and Lee 2020).",
