However, most of these knowledge-enhanced PLMs embed static subgraphs of KGs (\"knowledge context\"), regardless of that the knowledge required by PLMs may change dynamically according to specific text (\"textual context\"). In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Coke to dynamically select contextual knowledge and embed knowledge context according to textual context for PLMs, which can avoid the effect of redundant and ambiguous knowledge in KGs that cannot match the input text. Our experimental results show that Coke outperforms various baselines on typical knowledgedriven NLP tasks, indicating the effectiveness of utilizing dynamic knowledge context for language understanding. Besides the performance improvements, the dynamically selected knowledge in Coke can describe the semantics of text-related knowledge in a more interpretable form than the conventional PLMs. Our source code and datasets will be available to provide more details for Coke.",

For example, given two entities Steph Curry and Klay Thompson in Figure 1 , we can infer that they play for the same basketball team, which is not explicitly described in the given sentence.

In order to enable PLMs to better understand the knowledge context, intensive efforts have been devoted to injecting various factual knowledge of KGs into PLMs. ERNIE links entity mentions in textual context to their corresponding entities in KGs and then inject the pre-trained embeddings of the corresponding entities into PLMs. Although ERNIE has shown the feasibility and effectiveness of fusing knowledge embeddings for enhancing PLMs, it still doees not consider the informative neighbors of entities.",

KnowBert (Peters et al., 2019) and KRL (He et al., 2019) employ attention mechanisms to learn more informative entity embeddings based on the entity-related sub-graphs. Nevertheless, the computation of entity embeddings is independent of textual context. K-BERT (Liu et al., 2020) heuristically converts textual context and entity-related sub-graphs into united input sequences, and leverages a Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) with a specially designed attention mechanism to encode the sequences. Unfortunately, it is not trivial for the heuristic method in K-BERT to convert the second or higher order neighbors related to textual context into a sequence without losing graph structure information. K-ADAPTER (Wang et al., 2020) proposes variant frameworks to inject factual knowledge in different domains, yet still suffers from the similar issue like K-BERT. Although most existing knowledge-enhanced PLMs are aware of utilizing both textual context and knowledge context, their knowledge context cannot change with textual context, like ERNIE using single entities, KRL and KnowBert embedding sub-graphs independently of textual context, K-BERT and K-ADAPTER using fixed subgraphs. In contrast, our proposed Coke model can leverage dynamic sub-graphs of arbitrary size as knowledge context according to textual context.",

WKLM (Xiong et al., 2019) is trained to distinguish whether an entity mention has been replaced with the name of other entities having the same type to learn entity types. LIBERT (Lauscher et al., 2019) and SenseBERT (Yoav et al., 2019) extend PLMs to predict word relations (e.g., synonym and hyponym-hypernym) and word-supersense respectively to inject lexical-semantic knowledge. Moreover, there are also efforts on continual knowledge infusion (Yu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . Although these models do not use extra knowledge context to understand factual knowledge, they are complementary to our work and can be used together towards better PLMs.",
