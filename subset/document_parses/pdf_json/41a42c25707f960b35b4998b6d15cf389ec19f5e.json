To contain an outbreak of COVID-19, the role of a large hospital in this effort pivots on its frontline doctors, namely, emergency department (ED) physicians, assisted by infectious diseases (ID) specialists, to ensure that potential cases of COVID-19 are identified early and isolated upon arrival. This is challenging as individuals with COVID-19 may be relatively asymptomatic in the early stages of illness and may present with atypical manifestations; 4 early stages of COVID-19 may thus be indistinguishable from ARDs caused by common respiratory viruses. Case definitions are hence essential in guiding the ED physician with regard to triage of potential suspect cases. The role of the ED as a line of defense in ensuring that suspected COVID-19 cases are contained and isolated from arrival is crucial, given the significance of nosocomial transmission. 5 In Singapore, a globalized Asian city-state with close travel links to mainland China, the risk of imported cases was recognized early. The local Ministry of Health (MOH) published initial suspect case criteria on January 2, 2020, that, in line with the initial case criteria published by the World Health Organization (WHO), focused on patients with pneumonia and a recent travel history to Wuhan, based on what was known about the outbreak at that time. 6 Subsequently, suspect case criteria from both the WHO and our MOH changed to keep up with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first imported case of COVID-19 in Singapore was reported in end-January 2020, followed by the first documented case of local transmission in early February 2020. 7 As of end-February 2020, less than one-third of cases in Singapore were imported, and the rest were locally transmitted. 6 Previous analyses have suggested that the surveillance system in Singapore is robust, with a high sensitivity for case detection. 8 Here, we report our institution's ED experience during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 over a 3-month period that saw a gradual shift from imported cases to locally transmitted ones, followed by a second wave of imported cases with onward local transmission. In line with the national strategy of containment, our ED aimed to minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission by utilizing a broader set of suspect case criteria to screen all attendees with respiratory symptoms for better detection; enforcing strict segregation of patients with respiratory syndromes and/or fever from the rest of the ED, with infrastructural modifications to accommodate the surge of patients and improve infection control; and adopting a risk-stratified approach to the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE). The impact of this strategy in case detection, resource utilization and infection control was assessed. Uniquely, the sensitivity and specificity of our suspect case criteria could be assessed, given that all admitted patients with respiratory symptoms were tested for COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 913, "end": 914, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1372, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1671, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1794, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1925, "end": 1926, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Our institution, Singapore General Hospital is the largest public tertiary hospital in Singapore, with 1,785 beds. Our institution accounts for about a quarter of the total acute hospital beds in the public sector and about one-fifth of acute beds nationwide. Our institution's isolation ward (IW) was used to nurse confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19. From February 5, 2020, after our institution detected the first case of local transmission, all patients presenting with respiratory symptoms without an obvious history of contact with travelers or known COVID-19 cases were admitted to designated inpatient cohorted wards (\"respiratory surveillance wards\" [RSWs]). In the RSW, staff wore N95 masks and eye protection and SARS-CoV-2 was tested for prior to transfer or discharge via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) of respiratory samples. The minimum criteria for transfer/discharge was two negative COVID-19 samples taken 24 hours apart. 9 Broadening Case Definitions for Suspected COVID-19 Cases at ED Triage On January 2, 2020, our local MOH issued a set of suspect case criteria for COVID-19, mandating admission and isolation for every person meeting the case criteria. The criteria closely matched those released by the WHO and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 10, 11 In this study, the WHO's suspect case criteria for COVID-19, with close reference to our own MOH's suspect case criteria to provide additional local context for relevance, was defined as the \"official case criteria.\" From February 27, 2020, the WHO case criteria were broadened to include patients presenting with ARD with no alternative etiology and a history of residence in any country reporting ongoing local transmission. Thereafter our own MOH's suspect case criteria were utilized as the official case criteria, because the WHO case criteria would have automatically included all patients with ARD presenting to our institution, given local transmission in Singapore. In our institution, however, apart from the official case criteria, a broadened set of internal screening criteria was used to improve case detection. Both the official case criteria and the internal screening criteria were used at ED triage to decide on isolation of patients presenting with either pneumonia or ARD of any severity, based on various epidemiologic risk factors; patients who had the relevant risk factors were considered as meeting case criteria.

Outside of the fever areas where the bulk of patients were classified as lower risk, ED staff wore N95 masks for extended periods in areas where they might potentially come into contact with patients with respiratory symptoms, such as at all triage areas, corridors of fever areas, in the observation ward where patients with respiratory symptoms might be held while awaiting admission, and in the critical care area where patients with respiratory symptoms might need urgent resuscitation. In other low-risk areas of the ED, usage of a surgical mask was made the mandatory minimum standard. Mask usage was made mandatory throughout the ED as asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients might also potentially transmit COVID-19. 12 If masks were used for extended duration, they could only be used up to 4 to 6 hours, with N95 masks being placed in a new and clean zip-lock bag each time the mask was removed.

Given close travel links between Singapore and China, with almost 300,000 visitor arrivals a day, 14 our country was at higher risk of imported cases 15 and our institution had maintained vigilance for potential cases of COVID-19 since the start of January 2020. While using a case definition based on travel history and contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 is possible in the early phases of an outbreak when cases are mostly imported, during ongoing community transmission, distinguishing between cases of COVID-19 and ordinary pneumonia becomes difficult. Our institution had previously experienced an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in 2003; and appropriate triaging, cohorting, and selective isolation was found to be an effective and practical model of intervention in cohorts exposed to a SARS outbreak. 16 However, to achieve appropriate triaging, case definitions are crucial. During SARS, early studies showed low sensitivity and potential undertriage at ED, when the WHO case criteria for SARS were used for clinical assessment, in areas with established local transmission. [17] [18] [19] Furthermore, distinguishing COVID-19 posed its own set of challenges. In SARS, fever was a predominant feature on initial presentation, and few patients were asymptomatic, 20 allowing for fever and severity of respiratory disease to form part of case criteria. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] However, it appears that fever, though common, may not occur in all patients with COVID-19 on initial presentation, and individuals may not present with severe respiratory disease. In a large study of more than 1000 patients with COVID-19, fever occurred in only 43.8% of patients on presentation but developed in 87.9% following hospitalization. 22 Thus, admission strategies adopted during SARS outbreaks that focused on isolating all patients with febrile pneumonia 23 may not be feasible in detecting all patients with COVID-19 ARD on initial presentation to hospital. Admission strategies adopted for MERS that focused on isolating and cohorting patients with significant travel history and a compatible clinical syndrome 24 may not be suitable during the later phases of an outbreak of COVID-19 with ongoing local transmission. While official case criteria were fairly sensitive, more than half of confirmed COVID-19 cases did not fulfil the official case definitions. The effectiveness of case definitions in practice depends on the context and the user. 25 The importance of early detection of COVID-19 at ED triage cannot be understated, given that a single case of COVID-19 managed without appropriate PPE can result in the quarantine of large numbers of HCWs and disrupt hospital operations during an ongoing outbreak. 26 As such, to improve case detection at ED triage, our institution allowed physicians on the ground more leeway in determining who to test/isolate, via the use of a broader set of internal screening criteria. This improved sensitivity and the pickup rate for COVID-19 at ED triage. Usage of a looser set of criteria and flexibility afforded to frontline staff likely enabled our institution to detect several of the country's \"firsts,\" such as the first imported case and the first case of local transmission. While official case definitions are important to appropriately target testing, there must be room for flexibility based on the latest available information and clinical suspicion. In China, laboratory tests for COVID-19 were originally requested according to the case definitions, which included an epidemiologic link to Hubei or other confirmed cases; subsequently, a more liberal clinical testing regimen allowed clinicians to test at lower thresholds of suspicion. 27 Similarly, the initial cases of COVID-19 in other countries were only detected because of a higher index of suspicion by frontline clinicians, because they did not meet official case criteria. 28, 29 However, increased sensitivity comes at the expense of specificity, and a fine balance needs to be struck, because an overly broad definition will strain hospital resources, especially in institutions with limited isolation beds. Infrastructural modifications are also necessary to accommodate the increased number of suspected COVID-19 cases identified using a broader set of internal screening criteria. By partitioning the ED into higher risk and lower-risk areas, and setting up different traffic flows, the risk of cross-infection can be mitigated. 30 Finally, while most COVID-19 cases presenting to our ED over a 12-week period were successfully isolated, one-fifth of cases did not have any known epidemiologic links that allowed detection based on case criteria alone. This suggests that, as community penetration deepens, likely through mildly symptomatic cases, it will be more and more difficult to use epidemiologic criteria to pick out potential cases at triage in the ED. Within the ED, managing all patients presenting with respiratory syndromes in designated fever areas and the creation of inpatient RSWs, with upgraded PPE and better bed spacing of patients, would appear to be the last line of defense against patient-to-staff transmission during an outbreak of COVID-19 with ongoing community transmission. This is essential, given that even a single patient in an overcrowded ED can ignite a nosocomial outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel pathogen, with devastating consequences. 31 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 347, "end": 349, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1088, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1365, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1370, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1375, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1641, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1646, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1647, "end": 1651, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1652, "end": 1656, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1661, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2009, "end": 2011, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2133, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2389, "end": 2391, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2724, "end": 2726, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2992, "end": 2994, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3971, "end": 3973, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 4167, "end": 4170, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4171, "end": 4173, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 4728, "end": 4730, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 5690, "end": 5692, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The limitations of our study are as follows.
