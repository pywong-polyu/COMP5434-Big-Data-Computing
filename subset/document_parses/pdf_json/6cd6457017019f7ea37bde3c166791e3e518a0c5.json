The findings reveal that young people's choice of a comprehensive secondary school, characterised by a higher dropout rate, is highly influenced by future expectations and family background. Further, teachers' role, learning methods and technology positively drive performance. Perceived cognitive skills only affect students' performance given their choice. Besides, an ANOVA analysis assesses that the interaction between cognitive and non-cognitive skills impacts performance. Peer study is pivotal for success in individuals with perceived cognitive difficulties.",

High school dropout is also more likely to suffer from depression or other mental health issues, join gangs or be involved in other criminal activities, and serve time in jail\".",

In this respect, the EU agenda promotes more inclusive and equitable access to education, a stronger focus on addressing the learning crisis and teacher deficit and more support in education and training in emergencies and protracted crises (European Commission 2020). As far as Italy is concerned, in July 2020, the unemployment rate amongst Italian young people (aged 15-24) was 31.1% (ISTAT 2020) against 15% in the EU (Eurostat 2020) . The quota of Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) in Italy was 27.8% against an average of 16.5% in the EU. These statistics reflect adverse socio-economic conditions for young Italians related not only to macroeconomic shocks but also, especially, to structural factors, such as unsatisfactory education and training systems; labour market barriers and segmentation; limited public employment services that are able to engage young people and, especially, the most exposed segments of the labour force (European Commission 2016). The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to augment challenges further for this most vulnerable cluster of the population (Schleicher 2020) .",

Given the school choice, those who experienced favourable economic conditions could attain higher performance. Hence, to estimate the effects of the socio-economic variables on students' achievement in the first stage, the factor of school choice had been considered by keeping all the other factors constant (Kearney and Levine 2014) . Besides, perceived cognitive skills are assumed to drive both the choice (first stage) and performance (second stage).",

Remarkable differences related to gender have been found out; NEET females were 17.7% against 24.6% of males (CRENoS 2019). In this respect, Sardinia offers a relevant socio-economic setting into the root causes of poor performance within a disadvantaged and peripheral area in the EU.

The authors provided a detailed account of relevant items and the impact of policy and practice interventions on secondary school dropout and school completion rates. The questionnaire was divided into eight main sections as follows: 1. Socio-demographic background: (a) gender, age, citizenship, spoken languages, civil and job market status; and (b) parents' age and place of birth, parents' education and occupation, number of family members and number of trips in Italy and abroad. 2. Economic motivation: (a) information on the high school attended, including grades obtained (in previous year and diploma, if attained), number of debts (in specific subjects, a lower mark than six, as a pass threshold, can be recovered before the start of the following secondary school year by passing remedial exams), number of times the student repeated a school year (because of complete failure), whether brothers/sisters of the student have repeated a year, preferred subjects and subjects considered more difficult; (b) expectations and motivations for high school attendance, based on a five-point Likert scale (1 = not at all important; 5 = very important), including fourteen propositions on the evaluation of expectations and motivations that led the student to attend that specific high school. 3.

As already stated, it is possible in this manner to reveal hidden difficulties that were never clinically diagnosed, and that may subtly affect a student's performance and well-being. 7.

This sampling technique elicited relevant information from two segments of young people. The first segment included students attending secondary school (typically aged 14-18). The second segment included young individuals (aged 19-24) who had already attended a secondary school and were likely to have greater awareness and detachment about their past secondary school experience. The latter age segment represented different education stages and NEET (see Strack et al. 2007; Basit 2009 ). Altogether, seven clusters of young individuals emerged: (1) the first year of secondary school, (2) the second year of secondary school, (3) the third year of secondary school, (4) the fourth year of secondary school, (5) the fifth year of secondary school, (6) university students and (7) other occupations or NEET.",

Two groups of trained interviewers collected the empirical data. The first group comprised psychologists and sociologists who obtained the approval of school board and parents to run the survey within all the secondary schools in the capital province. The second group included trained university students who voluntarily interviewed secondary school students, university peers, employed, unemployed and potential NEET and municipality stratification as a part of their more advanced training. Particular focus was devoted to the Centre and North of Sardinia, as more disadvantaged areas exist in the island. A snowball technique also minimised response bias and attained a higher level of individual heterogeneity for a representative sample of young individuals with different attitudes, socio-economic backgrounds, motivations and achievements (Morgan 2008) .

These perceived cognitive skills are pivotal for active and effective participation in educational settings and social and interprofessional contexts. Low performance in reading and writing ability is amongst the leading causes of dropping out in secondary schools.

Gender differences also played a significant role in the choice as males attend comprehensive schools more frequently than females. These findings reinforce the gender differences and dropout gaps encountered by MIUR (2019, see also CRENOS 2018), as previously remarked. Besides, the expectation of entering the job market immediately upon graduation is a further key factor that drives the choice and is more common in the male segment. As expected, those who wanted to study at a university were highly motivated to enroll in a grammar school. There is no statistical evidence that individual characteristics and self-perception of cognitive skills influenced the students' choice. The second 'achievement' equation revealed that motivation and attitude towards the subjects (i.e. 'study_time' and 'subjects_are_interesting') drive students' performance. In addition, an internet connection at home seemed to drive schooling achievement, implying that technology supports their studies as a complementary tool. This outcome is consistent with the fact that a family with a higher income and a higher education level can direct their children to explore new forms of knowledge. It is also compatible with the findings highlighted in the literature that family, socio-cultural and economic factors influence the performance and choices of young students (Ballarino and Checchi 2006) .",

The school attainment, treated as the dependent variable, is defined as the average mark in the past year obtained by the two groups (i.e. no perceived cognitive issues and perceived cognitive issues). Five separate ANOVA employed each perceived cognitive skill as the dependent variable. Pairwise comparisons on equal variances assessment, as the null hypothesis, rely on Tukey and Bonferroni adjustment (Williams et al. 1999 ). The first non-cognitive domain includes the emotional components feeling bored and feeling anger at school. The second non-cognitive domain comprises practicing sports and regularly studying with own peers. All these factors are dichotomous variables (the 5-point Likert scale was defined as no = 0 if Likert scale is 1, 2, 3; yes = 1 if Likert scale is 4, 5). Students who felt that they were struggling in different cognitive spheres tended to perform worse than those who did not perceive such learning issues (although equal variance is not always rejected as the null hypothesis). This outcome also occurs within the variable interactions when students are studying without peer support. On the contrary, students who study with peers show better performance (at least a pass, a minimum of six) and even higher marks than those who did not state as having any cognitive issues. This result is consistent with previous literature on peer education (Ryan 2000) and collaborative learning (Chandra 2015) that emphasised the effectiveness of peer support on educational achievement and learning.

Comprehensive secondary schools, characterised by high dropout rates, tended to be chosen by male students whose fathers were older than 40 and did not attain a secondary school degree. This outcome mirrors the official statistical data that detected remarkable gender heterogeneity and better performance for Sardinian young women. Besides, it is consistent with the literature. While men were more likely to leave their educational path earlier, women tended to have better schooling performance and higher academic aspirations. It is also consistent with previous research for Italy that shows a lack of intergenerational occupational and earnings mobility (Raitano and Vona 2015) .",

Students were more prone to enroll in a comprehensive school if they wished to get a job soon after graduation, while they tended to enroll in a grammar school if they wanted to follow a university path. Hence, students attending a comprehensive school are also likely to belong to the most vulnerable cluster of society. As expected, young people (predominantly female) and their families continue to appreciate grammar schools as more formative for an ex-post university path (MIUR 2018). Interestingly, perceived cognitive skills do not seem to play a role in school choice. Hence, there is additional empirical evidence that family background and expectations are the most significant drivers in school selection (RQ1). These outcomes suggest the need to strengthen the collaboration between schools and families through specific orientation programs.",

Self-commitment and an interest in the subjects play an important role in schooling performance rather than the teachers' role, which should be a key determinant, especially in low-achieving classes. In addition, while internet usage at home exerted a positive effect on school achievement, the presence of a personal computer at school does not have any statistically significant impact on students' performance. Hence, as expressed in delivering knowledge through technological innovation, the teachers' role appeared to be an additional critical issue (Erdogu and Erdogu 2015) .",

Indeed, economic difficulties, fewer overall resources to allocate to education, or even less time devoted by parents reduce opportunities and attainments. This finding offers valuable information to school managers and policymakers who should provide extra support to students with such needs. There is empirical evidence that in Italian students, even from the middle classes, the dropout probability increased during the recent economic crisis (Ghignoni, 2017) . The financial difficulties faced by families can explain this phenomenon. Adverse economic situations in families can increase inequality and intergenerational social mobility (Aina 2013) . Furthermore, the Italian reform (MIUR decree No. 270 of 2004) , while attracting more students with less academic-oriented skills, seems to have failed to reduce early dropout rates (Ghignoni 2017) .
