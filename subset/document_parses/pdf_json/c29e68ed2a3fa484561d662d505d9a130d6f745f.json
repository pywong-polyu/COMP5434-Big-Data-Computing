To identify patients who are likely to be diagnosed with severe COVID-19, we analyzed the risk factors for mortality in patients admitted to the hematology department at our institute. The mortality rate of all patients was as high as 62% (21 of the 34 patients), and most of these patients had malignant malignancies. Patients before an achievement of remission had a 10.8-fold higher risk of death than those in remission. The group receiving chemotherapy with steroids had a shorter survival time and had an 8.3-fold higher risk of death than that receiving chemotherapy without steroids. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to carefully monitor or follow-up patients with active diseases and patients receiving steroid-containing chemotherapy.",

Among them, patients with active cancer have been reported to have an increased risk of acquiring COVID-19, with more severe conditions resulting in intensive care unit admission or even death [5] . Furthermore, patients with hematological malignancies, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, have immunodeficiency because of the disorder itself and anticancer or immunosuppressive treatments. Furthermore, several studies indicated that individuals with hematological cancer have a significantly higher mortality rate than individuals without non-hematological cancer [2] . Nevertheless, data regarding patients diagnosed with nosocomial infection with hematological diseases are insufficient. Here, we characterized the outcomes of our patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and analyzed the risk factors for mortality. We previously reported \"Retrospective analysis of nosocomial COVID-19: a comparison between patients with Hematological disorders and other diseases\" in the past, an overview is given below. Among the patients with hematological disease and those with other diseases, mortality were 52.5 and 35.1%, respectively, median overall survival of the patients with hematological disease was poor (29 days; P = 0.078) [10] . In this report, we excludes those who believe they have died of the underlying illness or who have been transferred to another hospital and are unable to follow up in detail.",

In contrast, Yang et al. from China reported that patients diagnosed with hematological malignancies had a significantly poorer prognosis than those with solid tumors (41 vs. 17%) [11] . A recent report from the United Kingdom also demonstrated that patients with hematological malignancies had a more severe COVID-19 clinical trajectory, including a requirement for intensive supportive interventions or even death, compared to those with solid organ tumors [9] . Several other published reports are summarized in Table 2 [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [12] [13] [14] [15] , which demonstrated an average mortality rate of 40%. In our hospital, although the mortality rate was 43% (21 out of the 48 infected patients), the rate increased to 62% if patients with asymptomatic, transferred to the other institutions or those have died due to the underlying hematological illness, were excluded from the analysis. Nosocomial outbreaks in our hospital have spread viruses to relatively frail and elderly patients requiring hospitalization during the short period and also many cases with intractable basic hematological illness were included; all of which contributed to huge numbers of critical cases.",

Kuderer et al. [2] have also shown that advanced, specifically progressing, patients experiencing non-remission had higher mortality rate than patients in remission. In addition, Passamonti et al. [8] reported that older age, progressive disease status, and several disease types, such as acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and plasma cell neoplasms, were significant risk factors from a large database of 536 hematological patients.",

            "text": "Second, the group receiving chemotherapy with steroids had a significantly higher risk of death and shorter survival time than the group receiving chemotherapy alone. As a result, lymphoid malignancies tended to show a shorter survival than myeloid ones because steroid-containing chemotherapies were preferentially administered for malignant lymphoma and myeloma. In contrast, Lee LYW has shown that patients with leukemia, but not with lymphoma, showed a significantly higher case fatality rate [9] . It is assumed that chronic lymphoid leukemia, which is the most commonly diagnosed leukemia in the Western world but rare in Asia, including our country [17] , has been reported to be at particularly high risk of infection and poor outcome, leading to an increased fatality rate, which might have contributed to the inconsistency with our results. Several other groups have also shown that intensive immunosuppressive or cytotoxic treatment increased the risk of death [5, 6, 9] . However, to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate the risk of steroid-containing chemotherapeutic regimens. From these results, it was revealed that the decrease in cell-mediated immunity, which was prompted by a combined medication of chemotherapeutical reagents and steroids had a significant effect on the severity of COVID-19. It is widely acknowledged that lymphocytes count at disease onset estimate the prognosis in cases other than hematological disorder [5] . In our report, patients with low lymphocytes count at the onset tended to have shorter survival time without statistical significance. It was reasoned that already at the moment of exposure to SARS-CoV2, hematopoietic a b c d e Fig. 1 The Kaplan-Meier curve for survival. a All patients, b remission or non-remission, c chemotherapy with or without prednisolone, d subtypes of malignancies (lymphoid or myeloid), e presence or absence of hypertension malignancies themselves or immunosuppression by chemotherapy had decreased numbers of lymphocytes on the whole. The number of lymphocyte count decreased in parallel with clinical severity (data now shown), which should have caused dismal outcomes. This study has the following limitations. (1) This study comprised several patients who were relatively young and non-severely transferred to other hospitals; therefore, the mortality rate might have been overestimated due to the large number of elderly patients. (2) The sample size was significantly small to draw a definitive conclusion. Despite these limitations, we proposed the following instructions. Patients with hematological malignancies before an achievement of remission or patients undergoing chemotherapy including steroids, have a significantly high risk of acquiring a severe course of COVID-19. These high-risk patients should be more strictly followed up for clinical signs of COVID-19 or should be intensively monitored at the time of admission. Choosing a steroid-free or reduced chemotherapy regimen, specifically for lymphoid malignancies, might be considered as another temporal option.",
