The World Health Organization (WHO) developed Problem Management Plus (PM+), a non-specialist-delivered brief psychological intervention, for individuals who have faced adversity. PM+ comprises problem-solving, stress management, behavioural activation and strengthening social support. However, it does not include an emotional processing component, which is indicated in trauma-exposed populations. Objective: This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of PM+, adapted to Syrian, Eritrean and Iraqi refugee youth residing in the Netherlands, with and without a newly developed Emotional Processing (EP) Module. Methods: Refugee youth (N = 90) between 16 and 25 years of age will be randomized into PM+ with care-as-usual (CAU), (n = 30), PM+ with Emotional Processing (PM+EP) with CAU (n = 30) or CAU only (n = 30). Inclusion criteria are self-reported psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; K10 > 15) and impaired daily functioning (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule; WHODAS 2.0 > 16). Participants will be assessed at baseline, one-week post-intervention and three-month follow-up. The main outcome is the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted PM+ and PM+EP. The secondary outcomes are self-reported psychological distress, functional impairment, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity and diagnosis, social support, and self-identified problems. The pilot RCT will be succeeded by a process evaluation including trial participants, participants' significant others, helpers, and mental health professionals (n = 20) to evaluate their experiences with the PM+ and PM+EP programmes.",

            "text": "Every year thousands of people have to leave their countries due to large-scale conflicts, wars, and disasters. The number of forcibly displaced people worldwide reached 79.5 million at the end of 2019, with about half of them being children (UNHCR, 2020). Eventhough many conflict-affected children manifest resilience (Sleijpen, Haagen, Mooren, & Kleber, 2016) , evidence suggests an increased risk of developing poor mental health outcomes (Fazel & Betancourt, 2018) . However, studies focusing on adolescent refugees are limited. The prevalence of common mental disorders in young refugees in high-income countries (HICs) is substantially higher than their non-refugee counterparts; 10.3% vs. 32.8%, for depression; 19.0% vs. 52.7% for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); and 8.7% vs. 31.6% for anxiety disorders (Kien et al., 2019) . A recent study among Swedish youth (19-25 years) has shown that PTSD stands out as a major disorder among young refugees. Compared to Swedish-born youth, unaccompanied refugees had a nearly six-fold elevated risk, and accompanied refugees had a three-fold higher risk of PTSD (Bj\u00f6rkenstam et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "To address these barriers, scalable and culturally sensitive treatments that are delivered by trained nonprofessional helpers from the communities have been developed. These helpers usually have the same cultural background as the people to whom they deliver interventions. One such intervention is Problem Management Plus (PM+; WHO, 2016) , which aims to relieve common mental disorders through simplified evidence-based strategies such as problem-solving and behavioural activation (Dawson et al., 2015) . Several studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in adults through individual Rahman et al., 2016) and group format (Rahman et al., 2019) . Even though the intervention is mainly designed for communities affected by crises in low-and middleincome countries (LMICs), it might be feasible for refugees in HICs (de Graaff et al., 2020) . Up to today, PM+ studies included adults (over 18 years old) and this is the first PM+ study including participants under age 18. PM+ is a transdiagnostic intervention, which is desirable for refugee populations who exhibit high levels of comorbidity. However, PM+ lacks a traumaspecific component (e.g. exposure) which is indicated for populations with relatively high levels of PTSD (ISTSS, 2018) . PM+ was effective at reducing PTSD symptoms at 3-month follow-up assessments (Rahman et al., 2016 (Rahman et al., , 2019 , even without retrieval of traumatic memories being a component of the intervention. To further elucidate the contribution of traumatic memory retrieval in reducing PTSD symptoms, this study seeks to compare PM+ with PM+ including an emotion processing component (PM+EP). During EP, participants will be asked to identify one significant distressing memory and two pleasurable memories, which is added to a graphical representation (a jigsaw puzzle with three pieces, each piece representing a significant event). By constructing a life story, the participant is provided the opportunity to adequately contextualize significant events, which may facilitate the recognition of interrelated emotional networks of experiences (cf., Schauer, Neuner, & Elbert, 2005) . Since this module will be added to a transdiagnostic intervention to reduce psychological distress, the distressing event may be a traumatic event, or any other adverse event with negative impact. Previous research has shown that interventions that include exposure to traumatic memories can be safely administered to adolescents by task-shifting (Rossouw, Yadin, Alexander, & Seedat, 2018) . Further, studies have shown that processing positive memories can also result in positive mental health outcomes (Contractor, Banducci, Jin, Keegan, & Weiss, 2020) so we included pleasurable events as well. We investigate whether this module will be feasible for refugee youth, and acceptable in promoting psychosocial functioning.",

The CAPS-5 can be used with people older than 16 years old. The CAPS-5 is composed of seven clusters (from A to G) corresponding to the PTSD diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Each diagnostic criterion is rated from 0 to 4 (0 = absent to 4 = extreme/ incapacity). Total symptom severity (range: 0-80) is calculated by summing up the first 20 PTSD symptoms. When the symptom severity score is rated 2 (moderate/threshold) or higher, a symptom is considered as present. The presence of at least one Criterion B (intrusion), Criterion C (avoidance), Criterion D (cognitions and mood), and two Criterion E (arousal and reactivity) symptoms are needed for a diagnosis. In addition, Criterion F (duration of the disturbance) and Criterion G (distress or impairment) must be met (cf. DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013). A Dutch version of CAPS-5 is available (Boeschoten et al., 2014) . CAPS-5 will be translated to Arabic and Tigrinya for this study.",
