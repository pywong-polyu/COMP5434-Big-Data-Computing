Less is known about COVID-19's total use of health care services, including both inpatient and outpatient care both during the 1 st wave, but especially during the 2 nd , 3 rd , and 4 th waves striking spring and fall 2021 in Norway. To date, studies of outpatient care use during the pandemic have focused on structural changes in its delivery, such as telemedicine visits vs. office-based visits [5] , whereas studies of the use of outpatient care services (such as general practitioners and emergency wards) are scarce. The use of health care services may be hypothesized to have changed throughout the pandemic, starting with limited test availability and many persons in risk groups being hospitalized and eventually dying, to mass testing, mass vaccination of persons at risk and an increasing herd immunity. In the latest wave, the health care services may be hypothesized to be better trained in how to manage severely ill patients, leading to declining inpatient care treatment and fewer fatal outcomes in the end than in the beginning of the pandemic.",

Because of previously reported differences in vaccination status throughout the pandemic [6] , differences in disease severity by SARS-CoV-2 variant [7, 8] and strata of age and sex [9] , we hypothesized that we would also see differences in the 30-day pattern of healthcare use for men and women, girls and boys, the working age population, and the elderly in the different waves of the pandemic.",

BeredtC19 compiles daily updated individual-level data from several registers. It includes the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS) (all testing for COVID-19), the Norwegian Patient Register (NPR) (all electronic patient records from all hospitals in Norway), and the Norway Control and Payment of Health Reimbursement (KUHR) Database (all consultations with all general practitioners and emergency outpatient health care), as well as the National Population Register (age, sex, country of birth, date of death). Thus, the register includes all polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway with date of testing and test result, reported from all laboratories in Norway and all electronic patient records from primary care as well as outpatient and inpatient specialist care. The establishment of an emergency preparedness register forms part of the legally mandated responsibilities of The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) during epidemics. Overall, data from Norwegian health registers have been demonstrated to be of high quality with high validity and reliability, and together they can provide a complete picture of patterns of healthcare use [11] [12] [13] . Medical recording to the National registries is mandated by law in Norway, ensuring no missing data in our study. The Ethics Committee of South-East Norway confirmed (June 4th, 2020, #153204) that external ethical board review was not required.",

Thus, we regarded people who were still alive after 30 days as recovered. When combined, and sorted chronologically on dates of occurrence, these data provided a comprehensive picture of the peak and total use of outpatient and inpatient care, as well as COVID-19-related health care pathways in the acute phase.

The 2 nd wave of transmission (February 17 th , 2021 -July 10 th , 2021) was characterized by wide testing criteria and free testing, start of vaccination, and was dominated by the Alpha variant. The 3 rd wave of transmission (July 11 th , 2021 -December 27 th , 2021) was characterized by continued wide testing criteria and free testing, most people vaccinated with at least one dose and was dominated by the Delta variant.

As an example, Denmark and Sweden observed hospitalization rates of 20% and 16%, respectively, in the first wave of the pandemic [21, 22] , which contrasts with Norwegian hospitalization rates of only 5% (Table 1 ). The differences may be explained by differences in test criteria, but also differences in criteria for admission to the hospital. Further, the Danish and Swedish rates are based on a pandemic period that was shorter than studied in the current study [21, 22] . There were also differences in mortality between the Scandinavian countries. Whereas all-cause mortality among COVID-19 patients in Sweden was observed to be around 4-5% [22] , we find a mortality rate of only 0.9% in Norway between February 2020 and February 2021 (Table 1) . Again, the discrepancies might be explained by the difference in length of the study periods as well as differences in registration practices of deaths. However, in line with previous studies, we see higher mortality rates among men compared to women, particularly for those younger than 68 years [10] . Also, in line with previous reports, we find that a significant share of those who died, died within the first 10 days (S1 Fig) [23] .",

Reports have been inconclusive as to whether mutant viruses (Alpha/Beta/Gamma vs. Wuhan strain) result in more severe disease requiring more hospital care [19, 24, 25] .

As an example, S1 Fig shows that a larger share used inpatient care prior to outpatient care, than the other way around, suggesting that outpatient care to some extent has been used for recovery issues after hospitalization. As such, more knowledge of rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients (severely and mildly affected) in the community care services is needed.",

Indeed, when we excluded visits that were related to testing, the total share visiting outpatient care during the 30-day period decreased, yet only slightly (from~80% to~70%). Thus, the somewhat different patterns in outpatient care use from the 1st and 2nd to the 3rd and 4th wave (Fig 2) may be explained by differences in testing criteria, i.e., the start of the 1st wave was the only wave with limited test availability and strict testing criteria (the elderly, persons at risk and health personnel). We believe that such differences in testing patterns are less likely to explain the decreasing demand put on inpatient care services throughout the pandemic (because frail and elderly persons were tested to an equal extent independent of pandemic wave).",

This may be explained by increased knowledge of the disease and its outcomes (including lower mortality rates) as the pandemic progressed. The milder SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant and a higher vaccination coverage might also explain the observed shifts in health care use (Fig 1) . However, we cannot exclude that more severe mutations in the future again place an increasing demand on the health care services. Also, vaccines might have lower effects against new variants. Thus, if we again see SARS-CoV-2 variants that cause the same disease severity as the initial variants, our findings of an only halved outpatient care use but ten times lower inpatient care use from February 2020 to February 2022 suggest that an upscaling of the outpatient care services might be particularly important in the future.",

            "text": "Several limitations should be mentioned. First, we do not know the causes or severity of complaints behind the care use following a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. Although we only included care visits with diagnostic codes of COVID-19, we did not separate the complaints affecting e.g., the respiratory or digestive system. Also, we had no comparison group, simply because we did not aim for any causal inference and because comparable data are not available for a similar epidemic or pandemic setting with other infectious diseases. However, in recent studies of postacute COVID-19, we demonstrate a likely causal effect of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 on the post-acute health care use [27] . Here, we also exclusively included visits that were specific to COVID-19, i.e., we did not study all-cause visits. Second, our study was of an explorative and descriptive character. Thus, we looked for patterns and trends in a large amount of data using mainly graphs in a self-developed structure, such as the division of age into children and adolescents, adults in working age population and the elderly, and by sex. We did not apply any datadriven analyses in our exploration of pandemic trends in health care use, thus we might have missed important details. To combat some of these issues, we chose to present a large amount of raw data visualized as alluvial diagrams in the S1 Fig. Third , we may have underestimated the care use among persons aged 68 years or more. Very frail persons live in care homes and receive institutionalized care that may not be registered in our data sources. And finally, and as mentioned above, we cannot exclude that some of our observations of changing (or stable) trends are due to differences in test criteria or -patterns as the pandemic progressed. Such patterns may differ across our groups of age and sex. However, if this is the case, the testing is obviously a part of health care use in relation to COVID-19, or else we would not have observed these visits. Thus, because testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been a part of the outpatient and inpatient care services from the beginning of the pandemic, including care visits in relation to the detection of COVID-19 is still important in the public health question of whether the health services should be upscaled or downscaled in future similar situations.",
