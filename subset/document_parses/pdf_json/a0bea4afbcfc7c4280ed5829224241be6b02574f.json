One major outcome of these learnings has been a deeper understanding of the ways our technical interventions should be aligned with and in service of broader social outcomes, through partnering with existing institutions, communities, and organizations. A second major lesson is the need to ensure accessibility and transparency to the public to build trust, and determine when (and if) technological solutions are best suited for the task at hand. These insights and additional context should be applied in disentangling the recent surge of interest in COVID vaccine credentials.",

For example, an issuing hospital in Japan cannot be expected to have pre-established trust relationships with all potential verifiers in the US -airports, restaurants, hotels, etc. Thus, the usage of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) has emerged as a promising technology.

A fundamental vulnerability is the compromise of a private key. Another potential vulnerability is that if verifiers collude, they can track a user's movements. There are several ways to address these concerns, such as pairwise identifiers. Another common distinction between types of credentials is whether Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are integrated, which allow assertions to be verified about a credential without giving all the information in a credential (for example, calculating that someone is over 21 without seeing their age). This is one extreme of a spectrum of technologies to limit how much information is exposed when showing a credential, which range from only being able to show the entire credential, being able to only show specific bits of a credential, and being able to show just a fact that can be derived from the credential. The extent to which this creates or reduces privacy concerns also depends on the use case. However, the ZKPs have not been implemented at scale yet, and the technology is thus largely untested.",

This is yet another area where depending on the use case this may be more or less ideal. For airlines and employers, revealing common attributes of a person's identity isn't a privacy concern, since the verifier is already aware of these attributes. Another challenge is that identity verification of vaccine recipients has not been performed robustly during the vaccination process in some countries, including the US and the UK.

No matter how perfectly designed a credential system is, it won't interoperate in practice unless the necessary stakeholders adopt and implement it correctly. One approach to driving adoption would be to legislate mandatory use of a specific verifiable credential, which has been suggested but has significant downsides in preserving choice, consent, and privacy. Instead, regulation of credential technology must be approached with collaboration from those who would be required to implement and use it, to avoid implementation failure and backlash. This will in practice require significant investment in education across relevant institutions, stakeholders, and user communities to ensure an understanding of and access to the technology to facilitate adoption. As of now, there also does not yet exist a plan to interoperate digital verifiable credentials with the paper vaccine proofs and certificates that are currently being handed out to vaccinated individuals. Given that hundreds of millions of individuals have already been vaccinated before verifiable digital credentials are widely available, this is a significant gap in interoperable adoption. The DIVOC initiative in India does use paper certificates with QR codes as one version of digital credentials, [3] but we currently have minimal information on the rollout success of this.",

We should also expect to see our scientific understanding evolve as we learn more about covid, vaccines, and the effect of various public health interventions, including where the use of vaccine credentials has positive or negative outcomes. While we are hopeful that there is a place for vaccine credentials in public health policy to make people safer and incentivize staying up to date on vaccinations, this is still very much theoretical. Clumsy implementations of the technology may contribute to backlash or exacerbate existing disparities, leading to greater divisiveness surrounding vaccines. Vaccine credentialing also requires access to vaccines, and we should not contribute to gating services on proving vaccine use without universal vaccine access.",
