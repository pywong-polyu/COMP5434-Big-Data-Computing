As a result, differential gene expression analyses detected the cathepsin L (CTSL) gene to be significantly upregulated, with FDR < 0.05 and log 2 fold change value > 1; thus, this gene was identified as a differentially expressed gene. Given that the cathepsin L protein is related to invasion of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), mild cold stress might alter the susceptibility to coronavirus disease-19 in humans. The gene ontology enrichment analysis for 14 genes with FDR < 0.05 suggested that immune-related molecules could be activated by mild cold stress.",

            "text": "Anatomically modern humans emerged in Africa ~300,000 to 200,000 years ago [1] ; they then dispersed worldwide from Africa many tens of thousands of years ago, but the timing remains controversial [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . This migration event is called \"Out-of-Africa\" and these migrating human populations have genetically adapted to various local environments [7, 8] . Physiological thermoregulatory ability is one of the crucial factors for adapting to local environments, especially to cold environments outside Africa. In response to cold conditions, skin blood vessels are constricted to minimize heat loss from the human body, while metabolic heat production can compensate the heat loss occurring after vasoconstriction [9] . Humans have two main types of adipose tissue, white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues, along with a third adipose tissue called the beige or brite adipose tissue that is present in WAT (brown-like thermogenic adipocytes). BAT is involved in thermoregulatory nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) through adrenergic stimulation [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . NST is defined as \"heat production due to metabolic energy transformation by processes that do not involve contraction of the skeletal muscles, \" whereas shivering thermogenesis is defined as \"an increase in the rate of heat production during cold exposure due to increased contractile activity of the skeletal muscles not involving voluntary movements and external work\" [15] . Thermoregulatory ability can be affected by lifestyles such as exercise and seasonal acclimatization [9, 16] whereas repeated cold exposure can induce insulative cold adaptation without altered metabolic response [17] .",

The uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) gene is highly expressed in BAT related to adaptive adrenergic NST [18] , resulting from the uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration from ATP synthesis. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes of UCP1 can affect adaptive responses to cold environments as well as the development of obesity through energy expenditure in human populations [19, 20] and even in Japanese individuals [21] [22] [23] . Further, Japanese individuals with the AA genotype of SNP rs1057001 in the tribbles pseudokinase 2 (TRIB2) gene showed relatively high expression levels of several thermogenic-related genes [24] , suggesting that this genotype is adaptive to cold climates. A previous study has reported that positive natural selection may have operated on a regulatory genetic variant near the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) gene in Eurasian populations for cold adaptation [25] , whereas strong signals of positive selection were detected in genomic regions containing carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) genes on chromosome 11 in Northeastern Siberian populations [26] .",

Further, transcriptome analysis using a microarray-based assay to investigate shared molecular adaptive responses between cold acclimation (14-15\u00b0C) and exercise training in the skeletal muscles of patients with type 2 diabetes showed overlapping effects on the transcriptional profiles involved in tissue remodeling [30] .

The RNA quality for each sample is shown in Additional file 1: Table S1 . The sequence library was prepared using the TruSeq \u00ae Stranded Total RNA Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) after RNA integrity was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer or TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA-seq was conducted on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina) with 100-bp paired-end (PE) reads. The quality check, library preparation, and RNA-seq were performed by Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea). We removed the Illumina PE adapters and low-quality reads using fastp ver. 0.19.7 [33] . PE reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using STAR ver. 2.5.3 [34] .

Transcriptional profiles differ between WAT and BAT in humans [47] and mice [48] during cold exposure; thus, it is possible that the transcriptional profiles of saliva samples are largely different from those of adipose tissues under cold conditions and that the transcriptional dynamics are less sensitive to cold stress.

This analysis detected 11 and 3 significantly (FDR < 0.05) upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively (Table 2 ). However, the |LFC| value of 13 genes was less than unity (equivalently, their expression levels after cold exposure were less than twice compared to those before the exposure), whereas the value of the cathepsin L (CTSL) gene alone was higher than unity ( Fig. 2 ; LFC = 1.03, FDR = 0.049). Therefore, we identified CTSL as the DEG in the present study. Although the remaining genes did not reach the |LFC| threshold, some of the genes with smaller changes had sufficient read counts compared with CTSL, and these changes seemed to be sufficiently reliable. Therefore, we identified the 13 genes as moderate DEGs. Differential expression analysis for the hypobaric hypoxic experiment in our previous study identified 30 upregulated DEGs [40] , whereas the present study on cold exposure detected a single upregulated DEG (i.e., CTSL). The sample size of the previous study (three individuals) was smaller than that of the present study (six individuals); additionally, we confirmed no significant difference in the gene expression levels under no-stimulus conditions [40] . Consequently, the small number of the DEGs observed in the present study is unlikely due to the samples size and might be attributed to the possibilities described above (i.e., mild cold stress, short-term cold exposure, blunted transcriptional response in saliva to cold stress, or seasonal acclimatization).",

Promoter or enhancer regions are more likely to be the factor affecting transcriptional variations; however, we did not collect DNA samples. It will thus be desirable to examine genetic variants in the CTSL genomic region, including neighboring regions, to detect the genetic factors related to the differences in the transcriptional changes.

The mean values of relative quantification in the study subjects were higher after cold exposure than before the exposure with a mean fold change of 2.87 (Additional file 3: Fig.  S2 ), suggesting that the expression levels of CTSL were upregulated after acute cold exposure. However, the difference in the mean values of relative quantification was not statistically significant (p = 0.44, by Wilcoxon signedrank test). It is possible that the salivary RNA used for the RT-qPCR was degraded because this experiment was conducted at least 1 year later after the RNA-seq analysis. In fact, the gene expression level of subject 4 before cold exposure appeared to be curiously higher than those of other subjects (Additional file 3: Fig S2) . This may result from the low quality of RNA samples, even though the transcriptional data were normalized. The results of RT-qPCR analysis showed similar trends to those of RNA-seq analysis; however, further analysis of real-time RT-qPCR with a larger sample size is required in the future.",

The hierarchical tree of GO terms is shown in Additional file 3: Fig. S3 . The enrichment analysis identified a total of eight significantly overrepresented GO terms in the biological process category (FDR < 0.05, by Fisher's exact test). All the GO terms were related to migrations of white blood cell subtypes such as leukocyte migration (Table 3) ; thus, molecules involved in immune functions may be activated by the cold exposure experiments. In fact, it has been reported that acute mild cold stress may affect the proliferation of several white blood cell subtypes although effects of the proliferation on host defense remain unknown [49] . Incidentally, the expression change in the CD177 molecule (CD177) gene was the most statistically significant (FDR = 6.46\u00d710 -5 ) in the differential expression analysis. CD177 can be a neutrophil activation marker, and it has been reported that the expression levels were positively correlated with the severity of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) [50] . Since the LFC value of CD177 (LFC = 0.999) was quite close to the threshold (LFC = 1.000), it is possible that CD177 is upregulated by cold stress. We will examine the transcriptional alteration of this gene under improved experimental conditions in the future.",

            "text": "The cathepsin L protein is a lysosomal cysteine proteinase involved in the catabolism of intracellular proteins such as collagen and elastin [51, 52] . The GO terms of the human CTSL included fibronectin binding, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, adaptive immune response, cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, and protein binding. According to the KEGG database, CTSL plays major roles in immune responses including antigen processing and presentation ( Table 4 ). The cathepsin L protein has various functional activities including degradation of cellular proteins and autophagic degradation [53] . Notably, the cathepsin L protein is reported to be involved in cleaving the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [54] [55] [56] . The inhibition of cathepsin L can decrease viral infectivity, such as herpes simplex virus 2 [57] . In addition, the cathepsin L protein is required for SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the host cell [54, 56] and cold conditions may be a potential risk factor in the spread of COVID-19 [58] . One may hypothesize that cold stress increases susceptibility to COVID-19 infection in humans via the transcriptional changes in CTSL. Further analyses for transcriptional changes in response to different intensities of cold stress with different sampling points are required to examine whether consistent CTSL expression patterns are observed. The present study had several limitations. First, the transcriptional profiles observed in the present study were derived from saliva samples only; thus, transcriptome analyses of other tissues such as skin and blood are required because the gene expression patterns among tissues are different. Second, the effects of middle-or long-term acclimatization to cold stress remain unclear. Third, as the significant gene expression change in CTSL was not replicated, a replication study in other Japanese cohorts is required to validate this expression change. Fourth, the functional relevance of CTSL upregulation to physiological changes in response to cold stress remains unclear and needs to be elucidated.",
