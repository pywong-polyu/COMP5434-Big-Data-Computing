Different countries and regions have made different policies in control and prevention of the spread of SARS-CoV-2. It is known that the spread rate of a virus, i.e. SARS-CoV-2, heavily depends on population density. 1 Besides, population density has large impacts on the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of SARS-COV-2. 2 It is also observed that patients in high-transmission areas have a higher incidence of severe coronavirus disease outcomes when compared with patients in low-transmission areas. 3 To this end, this study investigates the spread rates of SARS-CoV-2 in different regions with different population densities.",

Second, number of infections heavily depends on the sufficiency of test facilities and reagents. When more tests are performed, the number of infections gets larger.",

First, SARS-CoV-2 has higher spread rates in regions with high population densities than regions with low population densities. Before mid-April, when the spread rates of SARS-CoV-2 achieve maximal values for the four regions, the spread rate of SARS-CoV-2 in region 4 is higher than the spread rate in region 3, followed by the spread rates in region 2, which exceeds the spread rates in region 1 ( Figure 1 ). On average, the spread rates in region 4 are 8.0 times as the spread rates in region 1 before 15 April 2020. Similarly, the spread rates in region 3 and region 2 are 3.9 and 1.7 times as the spread rates in region 1 before 15 April 2020. We note that SARS-CoV-2 achieves the maximal spread rates around mid-April in the four regions. However, control and prevention measures are adopted as early as 22 March 2020 when the residents of New York were required to stay home. 6 It was reported that the median time from illness onset to death is 18.5 days for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 7 Since the spread rate in this study is defined on number of new death, the spread rates achieve the maximal values at least 18.5 days after the control and prevention measures are adopted.",

However, the spread rates of SARS-CoV-2 in regions 3, 2 and 1 are reduced to 46.1, 73.3 and 100.6%, respectively, in the same time period. In other words, the control and prevention measures have very significant effects in region 4 (counties with very high population densities), i.e. the spread rate of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced for >10 times. On the other hand, the control and prevention measures have almost no effect in region 1 (counties with very low population densities), i.e. the spread rate of SARS-CoV-2 retains at the same level. In addition, the control and prevention measures have limited effect to reduce the spread rate of SARS-CoV-2 for region 3 as well.",
