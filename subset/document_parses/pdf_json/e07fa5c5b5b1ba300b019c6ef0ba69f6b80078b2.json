Onequarter of global newborn deaths occur in the Indian subcontinent. 4 Every newborn action plan (ENAP) launched in 2014 has set a global target of fewer than 12 newborn deaths per 1000 live births and fewer than 12 stillbirths per 1000 total births by 2030. 5 The sustainable development goals (SDG) newborn targets for NMR reduction are like ENAP targets. 6 India has set a more stringent target for itself by committing to reduce its NMR and stillbirth rates to a single digit by 2030. 7 As a step in this direction, India launched its newborn action plan (India newborn action plan; INAP) in September 2014 and has made concerted efforts to improve access and improve the quality of care.",

The Lancet Global Health Commission report on high-quality health systems in the SDG era 24 mentions that the universal health coverage strategy, without quality, is not sufficient to improve health in LMICs. The scale and scope of the aforementioned national programmes addressing the continuum of care around birth reveal a shift towards effective macrolevel interventions with a strong focus on strengthening other social systems and effective governance. This shift is essential for ensuring a better quality of care for the communities in LMIC settings. 1 This brief aims to introduce the readers to the policy instruments, the range of high-impact life course, multisectoral interventions and the role of quality of care in achieving the ENAP/SDG 2030 goals as implemented in India.",

The editorial team and the peer reviewers of the South Asian edition deserve congratulations for bringing out this issue amidst sequential waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and highly challenging situations across South Asia during this period. The current issue contains articles focusing on preventing medication errors, improving the duration of Kangaroo mother care, improving the quality of antenatal services and improving participatory family care, using a simple point of care quality improvement approach. This issue will continue to publish articles on a revolving basis and will be followed up by the third edition of the South Asia supplement in 2023.
