            "text": "Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare type of neurological disorder in childhood. Most polyneuropathies occurring in children, \u223c85%, are hereditary (1) . The immune-mediated origin, observed in conditions such as CIDP and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), is responsible for \u223c9% of causes of childhood polyneuropathy (1) . The prevalence rate of CIDP in children is 0.22 per 100,000 (2) . CIDP symptoms, by definition, progress gradually over a period of more than 8 weeks in most cases, although especially in children, the disease onset might be acute, developing in <4 weeks, or subacute in 4-8 weeks. An acute onset of childhood CIDP may help establish the correct diagnosis of inflammatory neuropathy. However, slow progression, especially in younger children or even infants, can be overlooked and lead to a Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease diagnosis. The course of CIDP may be polyphasic-relapsing-remitting in 61% of patients, or monophasic, progressive in 39% (3) . The typical presentation includes symmetric proximal and distal weakness and/or sensory dysfunction of limbs with hyporeflexia or areflexia. To be diagnosed with CIDP, apart from the clinical criteria, the patient should meet electrodiagnostic criteria of demyelination (4) (5) (6) . Recent studies show the role of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) nodal and paranodal antibodies, including antibodies against neurofascin (NF155, NF140, and NF186), contactin and contactin-associated protein (CASPR) (7, 8) . Although most cases are typical, there may be some misleading symptoms leading to delay in diagnosis and treatment. In this retrospective study, we describe the clinical course, treatment, and outcomes in a group of 37 children with CIDP.",

The analysis population consisted of 18 females and 19 males younger than 18 years. Based on potential difficulties to reach a correct diagnosis especially in the younger population, and in order to evaluate any potential diagnostic challenges in the youngest children, patients were divided into groups by age at onset: very early-onset CIDP (<4 years), early-onset CIDP (4-13 years), and young age-onset CIDP (13-18 years) . All patients underwent a clinical assessment and nerve conduction study (NCS); a cerebrospinal fluid test was performed in most of them. The NCS was performed using a Keypoint R EMG device (Skovlunde, Denmark). The spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol included standard sequences: short-TI inversion recovery (STIR) and T2-, T1-, and T1-weighted with gadolinium enhancement. The following sequences were included in the brain MRI protocol: T2-, T1-, and T1-weighted with gadolinium enhancement; Turbo inversion recovery magnitude (TIRM); diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI); and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). The MRI studies were done using 1.5 T (Siemens Avanto) and 3 T (GE Signa) scanners. As part of the differential diagnosis, an MLPA test (SALSA Probemix P405; MRC Holland) for the most common genes causing demyelinating CMT disease (PMP22, MPZ, GJB1) was performed. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher exact test. Because of skewed distribution of continuous variables, Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the groups. All tests were performed at 0.05 significance level. Pairwise comparisons of the groups were performed if p-value for overall comparison was <0.05. Statistical analyses were performed in R statistical software, version 4.0.3 (Vienna, Austria).",

In the differential diagnosis, we have done genetic tests of the most common mutations causing hereditary neuropathies (genes PMP22, MPZ, GJB1) in 25/37 patients (67.6%) with all negative results. In most children (21/37, 53.8%), including also patients in the youngest onset age group <4 (8/11, 72.7%), weakness was distributed similarly between proximal and distal weakness (see full summary in Table 1 ). Cranial nerve dysfunction was observed in 6/37 children (16.2%). Cranial nerve involvement was more frequent in children <4 vs. 4-13 years old (p = 0.05) and children 4-13 vs. >13 years old (p = 0.032). In our analysis, 19/37 patients (51.4%) had an atypical presentation: distal variant in 13/37 patients (35.1%), pure motor variant in 5/37 patients (13.5%), and pure sensory variant in 1/37 patients (2.6%). Variants of CIDP among our group are shown in Figure 1 . Furthermore, 3/37 patients (8.1%) had additional concurrent symptoms, including involuntary facial muscle movements and hand tremor. We have observed autonomic dysfunction in two patients (2/37, 5.4%)-gastrointestinal (constipation) in both. A cerebrospinal fluid examination was performed in most children (28/37, 75 .7%) with increased protein >35 mg/dL and normal cytosis <10 cells/mm found in 23/28 (82.1%) of these patients. Among our patients, cytosis in cerebrospinal fluid ranged from 1 to 5 cells/mm (median = 2 cells/mm), whereas protein level 27.5-871 mg/L (median = 69.5 mg/L). In our group, 11/37 patients were tested for antiganglioside antibodies with eight seropositive cases-details are enclosed in Table 1 . None of our patients was checked for other autoantibodies against the Ranvier node-consisting protein.",

In our study, no differences between sexes were observed: 18 females and 19 males, similarly to other pediatric CIDP groups in the literature (2, 3, 12) , although in adults, more frequent occurrence among males has been described (2) . CIDP is often preceded by an infection, in children this has been described in 23-57% (12) (13) (14) vs. 33% in adults (15) . In the studied patients, symptoms were preceded and identified by an event in 7/37 patients (8.1%), with similar frequency in patients with onset age of younger than 13 years (4/37, 10.8%) and those older than 13 years (3/37, 8.1%). The most typical triggering factors were infections-gastroenteritis or upper respiratory tract infection-in 4/37 (10.8%), but also acute-onset type 1 diabetes, ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia, surgery for scoliosis, or transient node enlargement. More than 80% (30/37) of patients had an insidious onset of the disease, probably in more than 2 months; more than half of them were referred to our center from other neurological departments after a few months of observation, and for this reason, the correct time of onset and triggering factor could be difficult to estimate. In contrast to adults, childhood CIDP can more frequently progress for <8 weeks. The subacute form defined as increasing symptoms in 4-8 weeks occurred in 2/37 patients (5.4%) in our analysis group, whereas the acute onset, within <4 weeks, was seen in 4/37 patients (10.8%). The rapid onset was seen in 4/37 patients (10.8%) with onset age younger than 13 years and 2/37 children (5.4%) older than 13 years. A progression of symptoms in <4 weeks needs to be differentiated especially from the GBS. Apart from that, if the patient exhibits deterioration after 8 weeks from onset, or when deterioration occurs three times or more, the diagnosis of CIDP is much more likely (16) . Our data show that the course of the disease in very early-onset (<4 years) and earlyonset (<13 years) CIDP can be more dynamic; however, in most children, the course is typical for chronic neuropathy. Some data indicated that a longer disease onset predicts also a long-term disability (12, 17, 18) . These authors also reported that slowonset (>3 months) patients required more immunosuppressive treatment and a longer time for recovery than the acute-onset (<3 months) patients. In rapid-onset subgroups, cranial nerve involvement and sensory dysfunction were more common (19) .",

Our experience indicated that AZA, MTX, and RTX could offer a chance for improvement in patients with persistent limb weakness previously treated with IVIG and steroids. Only a few studies regarded treatment of refractory CIDP. The immunosuppressive or biological therapy is usually added to or follows a previous conventional treatment. Kim et al. (38) reported 10 children refractory to the first-line treatment. In their monophasic group (n = 6), four patients were especially responsive to plasmapheresis [plasma exchange (PE)] vs. IVIg. In the polyphasic group, half of treatment-refractory patients received cyclosporine, resulting in a successful disease control. The author suggests that an early administration of plasmapheresis in a monophasic course and cyclosporine in a polyphasic course may be effective treatment options for refractory childhood CIDP. In our population, immunomodulatory agents were also added to maintain a longer remission and allow reducing the dosage of steroids (due to AEs) or IVIg (in case of IVIg shortages in the pharmacy market). The patient treated with RTX exhibited a great rapid improvement (mRS 4 reduced to 1); treatment with MTX also results in a progressive recovery. One patient during the entire observation period was additionally treated with PE (1/37, 2.7%); this patient deteriorated after 3 courses: he experienced a progression of global weakness, anisocoria, and bilateral ptosis. The PE treatment was interrupted, and IVIg infusions were performed with slow recovery and stabilization. No other significant AEs following AZA or MTX were observed. Our data are in accordance with the study by Kim et al. (38) ; although limited by the small size of the group, they provide a new option for treatment-resistant patients, including the administration of AZA, MTX, RTX, cyclosporine, and plasmapheresis to refractory patients. Thus, in order to implement these treatments, early referral to experienced neuromuscular centers may be crucial for the choice of an appropriate intervention to prevent irreversible axonal damage.",
