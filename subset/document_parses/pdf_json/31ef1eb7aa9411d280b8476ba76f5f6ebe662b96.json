While effective COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized worldwide at an unprecedented pace [4, 5] , individuals who do become infected currently face limited treatment options. In order to prevent their progression to hospitalization or death, there is an urgent need for oral antiviral agents specifically developed for effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 [6, 7] . The non-structural SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a promising biological target, in that it is highly conserved in coronaviruses (unlike the spike structural protein, for which the mutation rate is high). It also plays an integral role in viral replication, cleaving polyproteins to produce shorter, non-structural proteins that are vital to the replication process [6, 7] . Nirmatrelvir, identified as a potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor [6] , represents one of the first orally available antiviral treatments for COVID-19 [8] . It is intended for co-administration with a low dose of ritonavir, with which it is co-packaged [9, 10] . Ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, slows the metabolism of nirmatrelvir so that nirmatrelvir is of maximal therapeutic benefit [9, 10] . On 22 December 2021, nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir received an emergency use authorization in the USA for",

In these regions, nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir has been authorized under conditional (or provisional [15] ) approval schemes [10, 13] ; further data on nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir are awaited by the regulatory agencies. In January 2022, nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir was also approved in Canada, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 [16, 17] .",

The impact of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 Mpro polymorphisms (of unknown clinical significance) on nirmatrelvir activity has been characterized in a biochemical assay using recombinant Mpro [16] . Certain amino acid substitutions were associated with reduced activity (G15S, H164N, H172Y, and Q189K; 4-to 233-fold reductions). G15S is found in the Lambda variant of SARS-CoV-2, which nirmatrelvir retained potency against in cell culture. Based on limited SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data characterizing resistance to nirmatrelvir in clinical trials, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro substitutions A260V or A260T (n = 3 and 1, respectively) emerged in 4% (4/97) of evaluable nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir recipients in the phase II/III EPIC-HR trial (Sect. 2.3). These polymorphisms naturally occur infrequently in publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences, as of December 2021. The A260V substitution did not reduce nirmatrelvir activity in a biochemical assay (fold-change < 1). Cross-resistance between nirmatrelvir and remdesivir or anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies is not expected, as their mechanisms of action differ [16] .",

Steady state was achieved on day 2 (accumulation \u2248 2-fold). After a single dose of nirmatrelvir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg in healthy subjects, the median times to peak concentrations of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir were 3.00 h and 3.98 h, respectively. Administration of nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir with a high-fat meal modestly increased nirmatrelvir exposure relative to fasting conditions; nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir can be administered with or without food [9, 10] . In human plasma, nirmatrelvir has a protein binding rate of \u2248 69% and ritonavir has a rate of \u2248 98-99% [10] . Based on in vitro studies, nirmatrelvir is chiefly metabolized by CYP3A4 [10] . The metabolism of nirmatrelvir is inhibited by the concomitant administration of ritonavir. Ritonavir is in turn primarily metabolized by CYP3A (CYP2D6 is a minor pathway which contributes to the formation of M-2, an oxidation metabolite). Nirmatrelvir is primarily eliminated via renal excretion (with \u2248 50% and 35% of a 300 mg dose recovered in the urine and feces), mainly as unchanged drug. Ritonavir is primarily eliminated via the hepatobiliary system (\u2248 86% of a radiolabelled dose was recovered from stool, with some expected to be unabsorbed ritonavir). Both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir had arithmetic mean terminal elimination half-lives of 6.1 h [10] .",

To be eligible for enrolment in EPIC-HR, patients had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 symptom onset \u2264 5 days prior to randomization, and at least one risk factor for progression to severe COVID-19. Risk factors included, but were not limited to, diabetes, chronic lung or kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression, hypertension, cancer, being overweight [body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m 2 ], or being \u2265 60 years of age. Patients with prior COVID-19 infection or vaccination were excluded from EPIC-HR. Eligible patients were randomized (n = 2246 in a 1:1 ratio) to receive either nirmatrelvir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg or placebo administered orally every 12 h for 5 days. At baseline, patients had a median age of 46 years. The majority of patients were white (71.5%) and 80.5% had a BMI > 25 kg/m 2 . Study treatment was initiated within 3 days of symptom onset in 66.3% of participants. At randomization, a minority of patients (6.2%) received or were expected to receive COVID-19 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. The EPIC-HR modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included all patients treated within 3 days of symptom onset who, at baseline, did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-19 mAb treatment [24] . In a planned interim analysis of data from 774 patients in mITT population (primary efficacy analysis), the incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalization or any-cause death through day 28 was significantly lower with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir than with placebo (0.77% vs 7.01%) [difference \u22126.32%; 95% CI \u22129.04% to \u22123.59%; p < 0.001], corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 89.1% [10, 24] . Final efficacy results from EPIC-HR were consistent with those from the planned interim analysis [24] . In the full mITT population (n = 697 and 682 in the nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir and placebo groups, respectively), Kaplan-Meier estimated event rates for COVID-19-related hospitalization or any-cause death through day 28 were 0.72% with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir versus 6.53% with placebo (difference \u2212 5.81%; 95% CI \u2212 7.78 to \u2212 3.84%; p < 0.001), corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 88.9%. In patients treated within 5 days of symptom onset who, at baseline, did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-19 mAb treatment (mITT1 population; n = 1039 and 1046 in the nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir and placebo groups, respectively), nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir reduced the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause through day 28 by 87.8% relative to placebo; estimated event rates were 0.78% versus 6.40% (difference \u2212 5.62%; 95% CI \u22127.21 to \u2212 4.03%; p < 0.001) [key secondary endpoint]. When data from all patients treated within 5 days of symptom onset (including those who received or were expected to receive mAb treatment) were analyzed, event rates were similar to those in the mITT and mITT1 populations. In the mITT1 population, the efficacy of nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir was consistent across subgroups based on age (< 65 and \u2265 65 years), sex, diabetes, BMI (< 25 kg/m 2 , 25 to < 30 kg/m 2 and \u2265 30 kg/m 2 ), elapsed time from symptom onset at treatment initiation (\u2264 3 and > 3 days), and baseline SARS-CoV-2 serology status (positive and negative). Compared with placebo, nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir was associated with a \u2248 0.9 log 10 copies/mL greater decrease in viral RNA load at day 5 in evaluable mITT patients (p < 0.001), with a similar result seen in evaluable mITT1 patients [24] .",

EPIC-SR included both unvaccinated adults at standard risk of progressing to severe illness (and therefore at low risk of hospitalization or death) and vaccinated adults with at least one risk factor for progressing.

Adverse events (reported while patients were receiving the study treatment and through day 34) occurred in 22.6% of nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir recipients versus 23.9% of placebo recipients, and were mostly of mild to moderate severity [24] . The most common adverse events of any causality in nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir recipients (\u2265 1% incidence and in \u2265 5 patients more than with placebo) were dysgeusia (6% vs < 1% with placebo), diarrhea (3% vs 2%), hypertension (1% vs < 1%), and myalgia (1% vs < 1%) [9, 16] . Adverse events considered to be related to the study drug occurred in 7.8% of nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir recipients versus 3.8% of placebo recipients and, in nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir recipients, were most commonly dysgeusia (4.5% vs 0.2%) or diarrhea (1.3% vs 0.2%) [24] . Adverse events of any causality led to treatment discontinuation in 2.1% of nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir recipients compared with 4.2% of placebo recipients [24] .
