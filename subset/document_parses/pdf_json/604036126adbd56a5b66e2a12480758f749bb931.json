The COVID-19 outbreak has since been declared a global pandemic, with the first United States case confirmed on January 20th, 2020 in Washington state 1 . Transmission of the virus occurs primarily from person-to person via respiratory droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking. 2 Within the United States, Massachusetts has been one of the states most severely affected, with one of the highest cumulative incidence rates of To this end, Massachusetts launched a \"Stop the Spread\" initiative on July 10th, 2020, to provide free testing, regardless of symptoms, to eight of the most affected towns in the state, many of which are economically disadvantaged. One of the cities included in this initiative was the city of Lynn. 6 Lynn has a median household income of $56,181, compared to the national median of $68,703. 7 Additionally, 16.6% of the city population lives in poverty, compared to 10.5% nationally. 7 To understand why cities such as Lynn are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, our study aimed to elucidate the influence of race, ethnicity, and social determinants of health on COVID-19 diagnosis.",

However, Black persons account for 18% of the U.S population, Hispanics and Whites account for 13% and 76.3% of the population, respectively. 9 The CDC also found that racial and ethnic minority groups have four to five times higher rates of hospitalization from COVID-19 compared to non-Hispanic white persons, as well as increased rates of death. 10 This suggests that minority populations are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. These disparities are likely due to long-standing systemic racism and social inequalities present in both society and the medical system.",

We extracted all LCHC patient medical records that fit the following inclusion criteria: i) the patient visited LCHC between February 1st, 2020, and July 1st, 2020, ii) the patient was tested for COVID-19, and iii) the patient was screened for four social determinants of health (SDOH) risk factors (food access, transportation access, utility status, and housing status). 1,969 LCHC patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis sample. All patients meeting this inclusion criteria were included. There were no exclusions or eliminations from this group. Demographics including age group, sex, race, ethnicity, zip code of residence, and SDOH status were also extracted, if available. Note that because we did not require nonmissing demographics as inclusion criteria, some patients in our analysis sample may be missing these demographics. For this reason, while we have a final analysis sample size of 1,969, this is not necessarily the number included in every analysis utilizing demographic data.

Ultimately, adjusting for age only changed the odds ratio estimate by 4.1%. This suggested confounding by age on this association was minuscule, and hence the unadjusted results were appropriate (Table 2a) . Because SDOH risk factors were demonstrated to be an effect modifier on the relationship of ethnicity and COVID-19 status, it would have been ideal to evaluate the extent of confounding by age on this more complex association. However, due to low cell counts produced when splitting the data into multiple strata, this adjustment was not possible.",

While the presence of an SDOH risk factor alone was not significantly associated with COVID-19 status, it proved to be a significant effect modifier on the ethnicity and COVID-19 relationship. In other words, our results show that those who are Hispanic are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and those who are Hispanic and have a SDOH risk factor are at an even greater risk. This increase in COVID-19 risk for Hispanics with a SDOH risk factor is disproportionate compared to non-Hispanics in our population. These findings may be due to a variety of systemic factors and inequities in social determinants of health that put racial and ethnic minorities at increased risk for disease. The Hispanic population has been shown to experience discrimination, inadequate healthcare access and utilization, inequities in education access, wealth gaps, and increased congested housing, all of which increase the risk of contracting COVID-19.

            "text": "While this data does not describe why SDOH status and ethnicity cause such a significant change in COVID-19 status, it provides tangible evidence that these disparities do exist and that they affect health. This highlights the importance of recognizing, studying, and making changes to the inequalities that lead to these social disparities. SDOH have also proven to lead to disproportionate adverse health outcomes in many other instances, like premature mortality, mental illness, congenital anomalies, Type 2 Diabetes, and bacterial infections. [27] [28] [29] [30] Additionally, COVID-19 is not the first pandemic where SDOH have played a role in enlarging health disparities amongst minorities and those of lower socioeconomic status. For instance, the United States HIV epidemic has shown a greater overall illness burden amongst those at the lowest levels of socioeconomic status, 32 primarily of minority ethnicity and race. Even in the 1918 influenza pandemic, research has shown that those living in Chicago neighborhoods with higher illiteracy had increased risk of influenza mortality. 33 Additionally, age was significantly associated with COVID-19 positivity. This is a wellknown finding and many hypotheses have been published as to why age influences susceptibility to COVID-19. According to CDC data, age distribution for COVID-19 cases follows a bell-curve relationship, with those between the ages of 18 and 64 making up the greatest number of positive cases. 34 While there are many biological reasons as to why this may be the case, i.e., ACE2 receptor density amongst different age groups, there are also proposed social reasons for this. Long-term care facilities for elderly, as well as daycare and public schools were amongst the first to institute COVID-19 restrictions. On March13th, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a lockdown order, banning everyone but essential personnel from entering nursing homes. 35 On March 16 th , the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ordered the closure of all public and private elementary and secondary schools. 36 This decrease in contact with other persons in these two age groups prevents transmission of COVID-19. [37] [38] [39] Limitations Although this study highlighted the important relationship that SDOH plays in the COVID-19 pandemic in our cohort, it has limitations. In our patient cohort, we did not find the same result that the CDC and other publications had concerning race and COVID-19 status. This may be due to limitations within the questionnaire. Limitations include the lack of SDOH questions concerning specific housing conditions (e.g., congestion, ability to social distance), essential worker status, income, and medical insurance status. These limitations may have resulted in patients not being included in the study that had SDOH risk factors. These SDOH risk factors that were not included have been shown to be significantly related to COVID-19 cases. [24] [25] [26] In particular, essential worker status is an important metric that was not assessed by this questionnaire. Essential worker status has been shown to be associated with greater COVID-19 infection and mortality. This association is not free from disparity. Research has shown that Non-Hispanic Blacks disproportionately occupy essential-worker positions compared with Non-Hispanic Whites. 26 By not assessing essential-worker status, it is possible that Black patients who did have this SDOH were not included in the study.",

Additionally, patients may not feel comfortable disclosing these personal parts of their social environment and this will cause an under detection of patients with SDOH risk. Our patient population was limited to those who were tested at Lynn Community Health Center and therefore, these results may not necessarily be generalizable to other populations.

Additionally, measures should be taken to proactively record SDOH risk status as patients are tested for COVID-19 in order to provide a greater perspective of SDOH effects on acquisition and spread of the virus. Increased quantitative data linking SDOH and health outcomes would be influential in changing health policy. A lack of data on health equity outcomes, as well as methods that work to reduce disparities in said outcomes has been cited as a major obstacle to policy change. 40 The number of studies that evaluating public policy and its impact on health equity continue to rise, but the number is still relatively small. A few states in the U.S., one example being Oregon, are utilizing systems incentivizing providers based on equity performance. It will be important to evaluate the effects this has on health equity outcomes. 41 An increased focus on addressing social disparities in healthcare can aid in preventing a similar pattern in future health crises and decrease the gap of adverse health outcomes amongst minority populations in the United States. Additionally, a standardized method for healthcare systems to collect SDOH data and the impacts of programs and policy designed to address disparities in health outcomes must be implemented in order to make advances and prevent further studies needing to cite lack of data as a barrier to improvement.",

For both COVID-19 positive and negative patients, patients in the 18-44 years old age group were the largest cohort. The majority of patients selfidentified as White, of which 443 were COVID-19 positive and 512 were COVID-19 negative. 442 patients self-identified as Black, of which 198 were COVID-19 positive and 244 were negative. Self-identifying Hispanic patients made up the greatest number of patients in both positive and negative patients, of which 792 were COVID-19 positive and 619 were COVID-19 negative. Most patients in the study were negative for at least one SDOH risk factor, of which 701 were COVID-19 positive and 739 were COVID negative. The zip code 01902 made up the overwhelming majority for the place of residence for this patient group. Finally, female patients made up 61.71% of patients in our study (",
