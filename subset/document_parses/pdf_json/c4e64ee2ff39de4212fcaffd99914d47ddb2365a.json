Compared to the nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, several studies have established saliva as a more amenable specimen type for early detection of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the limitations and high demand for COVID-19 testing, we employed MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry in the analysis of 60 gargle samples from human donors and compared the resultant spectra against COVID-19 status. Several standards, including isolated human serum immunoglobulins, and controls, such as pre-COVID-19 saliva and heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, were simultaneously analyzed to provide a relative view of the saliva and viral proteome as they would appear in this workflow. Five potential biomarker peaks were established that demonstrated high concordance with COVID-19 positive individuals. Overall, the agreement of these results with RT-qPCR testing on NP swabs was \u226590% for the studied cohort, which consisted of young and largely asymptomatic student athletes. From a clinical standpoint, the results from this pilot study suggest that MALDI-ToF could be used to develop a relatively rapid and inexpensive COVID-19 assay.",

Globally, there have been more than 189 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including over 4 million deaths, as of July 2021 [1] . Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 predominantly include fever, dry cough, muscle pain, anosmia and fatigue [2] . Infections may also result in a number of medical complications, which worsen in patients of advanced age or with co-morbidities. In contrast to many other viral infections, 48% of persons who test positive for COVID-19 are asymptomatic [3] . Additionally, a report by Johannson et al. [4] concluded that at least 50% of new infections originate from contact with asymptomatic carriers. These reports are difficult to interpret, however, because not all persons who are asymptomatic continue to be asymptomatic throughout the course of infection; percentages of persons who remain asymptomatic are reported to range from 20% -50% [5] , [6] .",

False positive results, although uncommon, can occur because of contamination due to the template amplification nature of RT-qPCR, high viral loads in samples, and widespread prevalence of infection. False negative results are generally related to sampling issues, nucleic acid degradation, testing in the very early phase soon after exposure or late convalescent phase of the infection, or infections with variants that contain mutations in the primer/probe binding sites.

However, RNA is extremely sensitive to degradation by ribonucleases and its extraction process is time-consuming, expensive and demands trained personnel as improper storage and extraction can be a major factor in contributing to false negative results of COVID-19 [11] . Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 has mutated over time [18] . This might prove to be a major challenge for tests that operate by detection of viral RNA by RT-qPCR. Mutations in the primer or probe binding sites may decrease or severely limit the ability of the assay to detect SARS-CoV-2. As such, multiplex RT-qPCR with two or three primer/probe sets may be needed to avoid false negative results. Moreover, a constant and long-term surveillance for mutations in the primer/probe binding sites is needed to ensure adequate test performance.",

Iles et al. have published a preliminary report on utilizing water gargle samples to monitor COVID-19 associated proteins using MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) [21] . The current study proceeds in a similar direction and utilizes saliva to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 through a simple gargle procedure followed by MALDI-ToF MS analysis. However, this study also compares the mass spectral analysis to the RT-qPCR status of the individuals from NP swabs. The method described in this article potentially detects both viral proteins and the antibodies produced against them. For the 60 saliva samples that were analyzed, the area under the curve (AUC) of potential viral protein and host protein peaks was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and the host immune response against the virus. The values for AUC of the biomarkers and viral proteins were compared to RT-qPCR results from NP swabs sampled in parallel.",

In preprocessing, seven subranges (shown in Table 1 ) were identified where m/z values were presumably indicative of host immune proteins or viral proteins. The intermittent values in each of the seven subranges indicated the presence of similar protein masses, hence ion counts in each subrange were coalesced together through integration of points to calculate the AUC which produced seven features for each data sample. AUC was computed by leveraging the composite Simpson's rule for each spectral range [23] . Simpson's rule is a numerical integration method that divides the integral range into shorter subintervals (indicated by three consecutive data points) and uses a quadratic polynomial on each subinterval to approximate the curve. If we define the width between each point as ( ), the start and end of each range are \u210e 0 and , respectively, where is the total number of points, the width of each integral ( ) can be \u210e calculated as shown in equation (1) . One limitation of this approach is the requirement that h be uniform between each consecutive point. In the mass spectrometric data, protein peaks had two floating points precision, which were unevenly spaced with different widths between two consecutive points. To make the widths uniform, each protein mass was rounded to the nearest integer and the mean of ion counts was taken at each integer value. This made the widths uniform with .

By comparing numerous positive spectra, it appears that there are at least two distinct species with closely overlapping m/z envelopes. This peak could represent the S2 fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which is predicted by UniProt (UniProtKB P0DTC2) to have a mass of 64.5 kDa (unglycosylated) with additional mass arising from extensive glycosylation [32] . Alternatively, this peak may arise from a fragment of IgA. As such, this signal cannot be unequivocally identified at this time. It should be noted that, in the mass spectrum of viral isolates from cell culture, an intense peak from bovine serum albumin occurs at 66,600 m/z; this unfortunately would suppress the signal from S2 (if present) into the baseline for the control samples of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure  4 ).",

An aliquot of this saliva sample was processed using the protocol for saliva samples in this study (Section 2.3) and the MALDI-ToF mass spectrum was acquired using the same parameters as gargle samples. The observed signal in the mass spectrum for the potential biomarker peak found between 78,600 -80,500 m/z was approximately 3 times the baseline noise level (S/N = 3), a commonly accepted value for finding the limit of detection in MALDI-ToF methods ( Figure S2 ). Based on the S/N ratio, we interpreted this sample as being positive for SARS-CoV-2. This result suggests that the MALDI-ToF protocol may indeed be as sensitive as RT-qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 in specimens that contain very low viral loads.

Cutoffs were made that yield the best separation of negative/positive samples. The samples with AUC values above the threshold were assigned MALDI-ToF positive and values below were assigned negative. The cutoff values for a given feature chosen under this criterion are reported in Table 2 , along with the percent agreement between RT-qPCR results and our analysis. For all five potential biomarkers mentioned in Table 2 , we achieved 90% and higher agreement with the RT-qPCR results. Although the identities of the proteins are yet to be confirmed, these m/z ranges certainly exhibit a relationship with the COVID-19 status. We refined these observations further with ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis, a commonly used technique in clinical studies to determine sensitivities and specificities at different threshold values of an analyte [33] . The true positive rate (sensitivity) on the Y-axis was plotted against the false positive rate (100-specificity) on the X-axis at each of the observed AUCs for every peak, shown in Figure 6 . The analysis clearly demonstrates the ability of the MALDI-ToF assay to discriminate between positive/negative COVID-19 status while providing a quantitative optimization of sensitivity/specificity for each potential biomarker, as summarized in Table 3 . Table 1 . Panel 6A plots data for the internal quality control biomarker tentatively assigned as cystatin A. The data points lie closely along the diagonal line with the AUC indicating no discrimination between COVID-19 negative and positive samples, as predicted. Panels 6C-G utilize data for the potential biomarkers S1, S2/immune protein, immunoglobulin heavy/amylase, immunoglobulin heavy doubly-charged, and the potential biomarker near 112,000 m/z. These five biomarkers show highly sensitive and specific discrimination between the COVID-19 positive and negative individuals with AUCs \u2265 0.933 and sensitivities and specificities of 93.33-100% and 90-93.33%, respectively ( Table 3 ). The closer the AUC is to 1 for ROC curve analysis, the better the model for predicting the disease state. More detailed results of the ROC curve analysis for each potential biomarker can be found in the Table S2 . Panel 6B displays the graph for the immunoglobulin light chains m/z region that shows a much weaker discrimination ability; this phenomenon was also observed anecdotally from visual examination of the mass spectra. In summary, the ROC analysis indicates that five peaks in the MALDI-ToF spectrum are capable of highly sensitive and specific discrimination of COVID-19 status in individuals. It is interesting to note that 89% of the positive samples were from donors who were asymptomatic. This is not surprising given that the student athletes in this study are generally young, healthy individuals. This cohort has been an elusive group to track, particularly early in the pandemic when only symptomatic persons were eligible for RT-qPCR testing. The COVID-19 positive, asymptomatic group were reported to be as contagious as symptomatic persons [34] towards the beginning of the pandemic and had been suggested to be disproportionately responsible for spreading the virus due to a lack of symptoms. This could be of concern in a setting such as a university where communal housing, dining and recreational facilities are predominant. Recent reports, however, cast doubt on a linear relationship between viral loads, symptoms and transmissibility, i.e., how much of an RT-qPCR detected viral load is replicating virus that can be transmitted to other persons is unclear. Transmissibility will need to be confirmed by viral cultures [5] , [35] .",

The method described in this study is relatively rapid and inexpensive and is sensitive enough to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in samples with very low viral loads. It has advantages over other tests such as non-invasive sampling and the ability to observe both viral proteins and host response. Comparison of COVID-19 status (assessed by RT-qPCR of NP swabs) with MALDI-ToF analysis over a wide range of 2,000-200,000 m/z identified five potential biomarkers of COVID-19 infection. These results need to be validated on a larger cohort of samples. It is also crucial to further identify the potential biomarker peaks to understand the relationship of the proteins with the course of the disease. Preliminary studies to identify the peaks were performed by examining human immunoglobulins and heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus by this reported assay and comparing peak masses of these controls to those observed for gargle samples. Further confirmatory analysis such as sequencing of proteins that occur in a healthy and SARS-CoV-2-infected saliva proteome is required. The verification of the identity of the human immune biomarkers may serve as a useful tool for monitoring the immune response under various conditions and stressors. While discrimination of COVID-19 status was based on the AUC of the separate potential biomarkers, we aim to develop machine learning models for achieving unbiased, higher accuracies using multiple peaks in tandem for clinical diagnosis.",
