            "text": "Sir, we wish to highlight the recommendations from the Royal College of Surgeons of England regarding the management of dental trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. 1 The usage of orthodontic brackets and modules in the management of dental trauma have previously been proven to be effective. 2 The usage of brackets and wire splints by clinicians may eliminate the need for an AGP as brackets can be removed without the usage of a high speed handpiece. 1, 2 As the capacity of AGPs carried out generally in both primary and secondary care have been greatly reduced, there is also a build-up of patients awaiting treatment in primary care leading to difficulties in accessing primary care. As such, patients often end up in the emergency department (ED) of a hospital, are seen by oral and maxillofacial senior house officers and require follow-up appointments for splint/bracket removal to reduce the risk of ankylosis of the traumatised dentition. With limited access to a clinical assistant and the facilities found in the dental department, it can be a challenging procedure to perform and therefore the competence of the clinician is key.",

For these reasons it may be beneficial for general dental practitioners to attend CPD or refresher courses where appropriate. Ideally, the undergraduate curriculum should also be tailored to ensure this specific clinical skill is being appropriately taught. Students can practise these procedural skills in a suitable facility, as a minimum to ensure confidence and competence upon graduation. With the current surge in COVID-19 and the emergence of a new phase in dentistry, we must ensure the next generation of dentists are well equipped with the change in times.",

The 'messy' lives of their patients were framed as an 'inconvenience' for dentists who merely wanted to fix their teeth. These findings confirm the worst about dental education, the persistence of the biomedical approach and the prioritising of technical proficiencies and clinical competencies at the expense of advocating for a model of oral health that is socially determined and where oral care is interactional, dialogical and holistic. While the authors acknowledge the shortcomings of this model and its negative legacy on patientdentist relationships and the profession, they throw down the gauntlet to dental education to rectify this predicament.",

When asked of patients, research confirms that this open question facilitates a dialogue between patient and dentist where mutual respect and understanding about the needs, preferences, expectations and values of each party can emerge and grow. 4 When asked of dental educators and dental schools, the question 'what matters to you?' forces us to contemplate what is dental education for? Whom does it serve? Where is the patient in all our deliberations? Clarifying our curricular priorities in such a way can help us begin the process of paradigm shift and curricular transformation.",

As mentioned in the paper, there is a strong belief that once the abscess is formed, surgical drainage is mandatory to achieve resolution. We would like to draw attention to a few additional considerations in managing such situations, which are as follows: 1. Regarding elimination of the source of the infection, if the cause of infection is odontogenic and there is a possibility of saving the tooth, initiation of root canal treatment (RCT) with drainage of the abscess through the canal using copious amount of saline irrigation should be used before incision and drainage is attempted 2. If drainage of the abscess through the root canal is difficult, a sterile #10 or #15 K file can be used for slight over instrumentation beyond the apical constriction.
