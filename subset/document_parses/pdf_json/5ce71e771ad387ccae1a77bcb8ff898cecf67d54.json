Therefore, rapid and accurate tests for SARS-CoV-2 screening are urgently needed to expedite disease prevention and control especially in community transmission. Since late December 2020, Thailand has faced a new wave of COVID-19 outbreaks. The Thai National Disease Control program at the Ministry of Public Health has identified suitable measure for mass screening. A SARS-CoV-2 antigen-based assay is a surveillance option for active cases. Here, we evaluated the feasibility and test performance of a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen test during our field activities in 1,100 asymptomatic individuals in Samut Sakhon, Thailand, during the second wave COVID-19 outbreak (December 26-30, 2020). The results showed that the rapid antigen test had a sensitivity of 47.97% (95% CI: 36.10-59.96%) and a specificity of 99.71% (95% CI: 99.15-99.94%) versus standard reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The rapid test performed better in cases with higher viral loads determined by the cycle threshold value. In real-world setting, the test performance can be compromised by several factors including viral loads, logistic chains, temperature, technical expertise of the operators, validity, and accuracy of the testing itself. Our study highlights a prerequisite for reevaluation of any given testing before implementing it at the national level.",

Thus, Thailand has screened for infected individuals since the beginning of 2020. 2 The first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand spanned March and April 2020 with 3,310 COVID-19 patients by July 2020. 2 During the first wave, pandemic control was based on testing patients under investigation (PUI) and their close contacts using the real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detecting specific gene sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as the gold standard technique for COVID-19 diagnosis. [3] [4] [5] The Royal Thai government was able to successfully control the first wave of the outbreak after 2 months, and there was no report of any local transmission for more than 200 days. 2, 6 However, the tide turned in the second and third Thai waves, which emerged in December 2020 and are ongoing. The first cohort was found in migrant workers in Samut Sakhon province. Many infected individuals were later found throughout the country after having traveled. As of June 27, 2021, Thailand has 244,447 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 1,912 deaths; there are more than 3,000 cases daily via local transmission. 7 This alarmingly high number of new domestic transmissions in Thailand has raised considerable concern and inevitably drives policymakers to revisit our prevention and control strategy.",

They focused our screening in camps of migrant workers, wet markets, and factories because these are vulnerable and economically disadvantaged populations with limited access to healthcare. However, standard RT-PCR requires at least 4 hours of laboratory time and skilled staff. 8 Therefore, rapid screening tests with acceptable accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to expedite disease prevention and control management in widespread community transmission. One possibility is the use of lateral flow immunoassay based on chromatography and antigen-antibody interactions-these assays are rapid and do not require any instrumentation. 9 Data on the accuracy and reliability of lateral flow immunoassays and other rapid antigen test appear to be vary. [10] [11] [12] [13] The test sensitivity versus standard RT-PCR was reported to be high: 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 86.5-97.4%) in an early study using fluorescence immunochromatography (Ag-RDT, Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Shenzhen, China). 12 However, the sensitivities can vary even within the same kit, for example, 30.2% (95% CI: 21.7-39.9%) versus 50% (95% CI: 39.5-60.5%) using the dipstick immunochromatographic assay COVID-19 Ag Respi-strip (Coris BioConcept, Gembloux, Belgium). 10 8 They showed that the sensitivity of the rapid test is 98.33% (95% CI: 91.06-99.96%). However, a limited number of studies implemented this rapid antigen testing in a real-world screening setting. Therefore, it is critically important to evaluate feasibility in a real community outbreak before nationwide implementation.",

For example, all air passengers arriving in the United States must show a negative COVID-19 result based on NAAT or rapid antigen test to prove recovery from COVID- 19. 18 Similar measures have also been used in Germany, China, New Zealand, among other nations. Moreover, rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen test has been proposed for screening in asymptomatic people or high-risk congregate housing (such as nursing homes) as well as community settings such as prevention and control monitoring. 19, 20 Unfortunately, the use of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing in public health settings for surveillance in endemic locations remains rare. Rapid antigen testing is less sensitive than RT-qPCR and requires a higher viral load for SARS-CoV-2 detection. 21, 22 Bruzzone et al. recently showed rapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a hospital setting: they had 78.7% and 100% sensitivity and specificity, respectively. These results were similar to those detected by RT-PCR. A Ct of 29 was defined as a cutoff value to maximize the detection in rapid antigen tests. 21 The sensitivity of the rapid test was only 41.2%, and specificity was 98.4% versus RT-PCR results, whereas sensitivity was 100% compared with viral culture positivity. 23 A recent review also highlighted considerable betweenstudy variability in sensitivity and specificity estimates. These also varied by antigen testing kits and viral load of the sample. 24 For instance, a subgroup analysis by viral load as defined by the Ct quantified a 53.8% absolute difference in sensitivity between samples with Ct 25 and . 25. 24 The diagnostic performance of commercially available tests may differ substantially and primarily affect decision-making during test selection. The WHO recommends that SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing have a minimum of 80% sensitivity and 97% specificity. 9 The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) has recently proposed a more conservative threshold of 90% for the sensitivity parameter especially in low-incidence settings. 22 Therefore, the routine use of rapid antigen tests may be suitable in moderate-to-high disease intensity settings when high volumes of specimens are tested every day.",

One apparent reason is that in this active case finding, we performed the screening in asymptomatic individuals who might have low viral load representing various stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 29 Nevertheless, some individuals with low Ct values (Ct , 20) can be detected with 100% sensitivity, which is closer to the validation study of the manufacturer (96.52%) in symptomatic patients. 30 Moreover, several factors, such as variable clinical onset and immune status of the subjects, could play a role. 9 In addition, the use of such a screening kit requires an appropriate logistic chain including temperature control for kit transportation, technical expertise of operators who must interpret the results on site, and the safety of handling contagious nasopharyngeal specimens. 19, 31 Recently, a publication demonstrated transportation and storage temperature also impaired the performance of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen test. Up to 11 commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid tests were evaluated using different storage and operating temperatures as well as short-and long-term storage times. Their results indicated that higher temperatures (37 C) resulted in about 10-fold lower sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection (eight of 11 kits). On the other hand, lower temperature (2-4 C) during storage would lower the specificity with a higher false-positive rate. 32 Moreover, the validity and accuracy of any given screening test should be performed in various settings to recapitulate the heterogeneity of clinical settings from hospital-based work to fieldwork. There is clearly a vast difference in terms of viral and procedural factors. One cannot rely solely on a single study before it is adopted widely. Policymakers must use any new approach to slow the pandemic. Our evaluation is critical and complements the manufacturer's data; both should be considered before implementing new technology in a real-world setting.",

Due to logistical challenges, we could not perform direct preparation of the samples and testing for antigen detection immediately after sample collection. Therefore, we could not exclude the possibility that detection via this rapid test might lower leading to a lower sensitivity. We performed a rapid detection process using VTM collected in the laboratory within the four recommended hours-this time-lag was allowed based on the manufacturer's guidelines. We have carefully controlled the VTM's temperature during transport to preserve the viral integrity. Nevertheless, our study design could have minimized the effects of double samplings: one for VTM and one for rapid antigen testing.
