A major obstacle in studying large-scale networks is that their size tends to increase exponentially. In addition, access to large network databases is limited for security or physical connection reasons. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling method that works effectively for large-scale networks. The proposed approach makes multiple heterogeneous Markov chains by adjusting random-walk traits on the given network to explore the target space efficiently. This approach provides better unbiased sampling results with reduced asymptotic variance within reasonable execution time than previous random-walk-based sampling approaches. We perform various experiments on large networks databases obtained from synthesis to real-world applications. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing network sampling methods.",

            "text": "HMC adopts the concept of Hamiltonian dynamics (the hybrid Monte Carlo is thus also called the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) in physics to the probability state-space to avoid random-walk behaviors that are exhibited by other sampling algorithms. The HMC uses momentum m as an auxiliary variable and its related gradient information to facilitate finding regions with higher probabilities when traversing the state-space for the original variable x. The HMC goes through two stages to extract samples. First, candidates for the next state are proposed through discrete approximation to Hamiltonian dynamics such as leapfrog, which generates multiple Markov chains. Next, the MH algorithm is performed for the proposed candidates, which are either accepted or rejected, to remove any bias associated with the discretization. This allows the Markov chain to explore the target distribution much more efficiently by avoiding random-walk behaviors, resulting in faster convergence [17] [18] [19] . A detailed account of the HMC can be found in previous studies [17] [18] [19] . Figure 1a depicts a toy example of several trajectories in a given state-space for a one-dimensional Gaussian distribution as the target distribution. With the heterogeneous multiple chains produced by the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC), the gradient information by auxiliary variable space makes exploring on the space efficient and effective. The HMC makes several Markov chain trajectories in the extended space to avoid random-walk behavior. As seen in Figure 1b , we found inspiration for generating heterogeneous multiple Markov chains with transition traits within a network sampling from the HMC. This inspiration alleviates random-walk behaviors while extracting samples by creating various heterogeneous chain paths on the target space of a network. General sampling methods have greatly influenced research on sampling large-scale networks. Representative network sampling algorithms are listed in Table 2 . The main purpose of network sampling is to obtain a subset of the original network such that the statistical properties (characteristics) of the original network are well preserved without incurring excessive computational costs. Properties are the essential factors in network analysis. If a network sampling successfully preserves such properties in the extracted samples, there would be a significant reduction in computational cost compared to analyzing the original network directly. In previous network sampling studies, the quality of preserving properties was quantified by a smaller gap between the estimated distribution from the samples and the target distribution on the database.

We propose a new network sampling method by imitating the concepts of the HMC [17] , which offers better sampling results by avoiding random-walk behavior. The proposed method provides improved network sampling results by producing heterogenous multiple Markov chain paths to traverse efficiently the space. Under restricted access, the proposed method also achieves better unbiased sampling results than those obtained by common reversible random walk. Figure 2 shows the overall process of the proposed sampling method for estimation on a large-scale network. A key point of our work pertains to the highlighted region in gray. The proposed method produces multiple heterogenous Markov chains, which was inspired by HMC to avoid random-walk behavior. These chains are based on non-reversible random walk with different traits by adjusting an auxiliary value, similar to the movement of HMC. In addition, the diversified chains are diffused over the network by avoiding random-walk behavior. To generate multiple heterogenous Markov chains, the newly defined momentum in the proposed method determines the movement trend between nodes while adjusting the random-walk behavior. The optimal momentum is derived from the characteristics of a scale-free network [32] [33] [34] .",

            "text": "The sequential version of the proposed network sampling method has a time complexity of O(|s|) and space complexity of O(|s| + |w|), where |s| and |w| are the size of the sample and its weight vector, respectively. As shown in Figure 9 , the time costs of the sequential version of the proposed method are moderate, even for large network databases obtained from real applications. The run time is shown as the average of the time of 2000 independent sampling tests on each network database. To handle extremely large network databases with limited access effectively, we can easily extend the proposed method by generating multiple cbs in parallel, as outlined in Algorithm 2. First, cbs 0 is processed as in Algorithm 1 with m cbs 0 = 0. Then, differing from Algorithm 1, as many as the hub nodes |cbs| \u2212 1 are selected in the descending order of d(i) from the generated cbs 0 . Finally, other cbs (cbs z , z > 0) begin simultaneously from each hub as a seed node to realize parallelized sampling. From a scalability perspective, the proposed method can be also executed on existing distributed systems to analyze of huge networks.",

            "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a network sampling method for databases with huge scale-free networks with improved performance on restricted access. The proposed method begins with the concept of reducing random-walk behaviors of network sampling methods by imitating multiple chains of the HMC. The proposed method adopts a momentum parameter on non-reversible random walk for a variety of state-space traversals. Multiple heterogenous Markov chains generated by the proposed method have optimized characteristics for a scale-free network. As a result, the proposed method produces effective and efficient sampling from a network database. In experiments with synthetic and real-world network databases, we observed and verified that the proposed method produces better unbiased samples in reasonable execution time than existing methods. In addition, the sequential and parallel versions of the proposed method can be implemented easily and are applicable to large network databases from a diverse range of practical applications such as the Internet of Things, sensor networks, social networks, and traffic networks.
