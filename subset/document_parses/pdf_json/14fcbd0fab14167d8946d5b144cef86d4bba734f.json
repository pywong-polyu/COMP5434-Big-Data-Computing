            "text": "Background: The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM) established the adolescent and young adult (AYA) oncology program in 2014 to address the unique needs of AYA by delivering targeted, evidence-based care through a multidisciplinary team. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent a consultation with the PM AYA program from 2014 to 2020. The association between the health domain concerns reported and age at consultation, cancer diagnoses, and time since diagnosis was analyzed using chi-square test of independence in SPSS. Results: In our cohort of 1128 AYA, the median age at assessment was 28.2 years. The most common diagnoses were lymphoma (n = 251, 22.2%), leukemia (n = 207, 18.4%), and breast cancer (n = 162, 14.4%). The most common concerns reported were related to fertility (n = 882, 78.2%) and work/school (n = 472, 41.8%). Fertility concerns were most common in 25-34 age group (443/540, 82.0%) and work-/school-related concerns were highest in 18-24 age group (191/355, 53.8%). Diagnoses significantly affect majority of concerns reported. Fertility concerns were most common in AYA consulted near diagnosis, while body image-, exercise-, and diet-related concerns were more frequently reported, while on active treatments. Conclusions: Supporting fertility concerns remains the cornerstone of any successful AYA program. Work-/ school-related concerns deserve more elucidation and attention. We identified important patterns in the healthrelated concerns of AYA, especially as they relate to age, diagnoses, and time since diagnosis. This insight will guide us for improving patient-centered care delivery to AYA.",

            "text": "A dolescents and young adults (AYAs) diagnosed with cancer face unique set of challenges, given their dynamic developmental stage. During this transitional period, AYA work toward establishing autonomy, developing a positive body image and sexual identity, fostering peer relationships, starting careers, and beginning families. [1] [2] [3] Receiving a diagnosis of cancer and undergoing associated treatments can disrupt the achievements of these key milestones. Accordingly, this population has psychosocial and supportive care needs that are especially complex and differentiate them from their pediatric and adult counterparts, and are thus not ideally suited for either pediatric or adult cancer care programs. 4, 5 Across diagnoses, AYA with cancer experience many unique challenges associated with their diagnosis and subsequent therapies, such as undergoing fertility preservation, maintaining sexual health and body image, developing coping mechanisms, keeping a healthy diet, having financial security, and sustaining work/school commitments. 6-10 AYA with cancer exhibit significantly poorer health-related quality of life relative to healthy populations. 11 Comprehensive programs to address their unique needs have been attempted in various parts of the world by different groups such as Teenage Cancer Trust UK 12 and The Australian Youth Cancer Service. 13 Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM), the largest tertiary cancer referral center in Toronto, Canada, established its AYA Program in 2014 with the goal of delivering highquality, evidence-based, comprehensive, and age-appropriate care to AYA. Over the last 7 years, we have aimed to deliver personalized care to AYA across their treatment journeys through a multidisciplinary team involving members from medical oncology, nursing, physiotherapy, psychology, psychiatry, social work, fertility specialists, occupational therapy, palliative care, physiatry, kinesiology, nutrition therapy, and community partners. Patient-reported value addition in the core domains of sexual health, fertility, social support, physical appearance, and work/school concerns, by the program, have been documented in the past. 14 Now we report a retrospective audit of all patients registered in the PM AYA program from its inception to December 31, 2020, with aim to explore possible associations between the AYA health concerns reported and patient demographics. This would help improve our delivery of care and provide an example for other similar programs worldwide.",

However, being diagnosed with cancer and undergoing treatment can affect AYA physically, cognitively, and psychologically. 9 These effects can manifest as concentration problems, decreased energy and motivation, fatigue, changes in mood, chronic pain, and difficulties performing physical tasks, 26 in turn affecting the ability to attend school or work, and thus to achieve their educational and career goals. 27 It is clear from our findings and is abundantly previously documented that AYA programs could benefit from more robust services that involve vocational and occupational therapy expertise and can play a key role in the transition to healthy survivorship, fostering productive futures.

Thus, interventions to maintain body image in AYA undergoing treatment for breast cancer should be prioritized in their treatment plan. Another noteworthy finding was the high proportion of work-and school-related concerns reported in patients diagnosed with sarcoma. While the impact of specific cancer diagnosis on RTW and school has not been extensively studied, this finding is in line with a recent study reporting that AYA patients with a diagnosis of hematological cancer or sarcoma were less likely to RTW. 39 In a qualitative study conducted by Zambrano et al., sarcoma survivors identified several limitations on their capacity to perform tasks that they were able to complete with ease before their diagnosis. 27 Some participants noted needing to take longer breaks or to work at a slower pace, whereas others had to find different jobs entirely.",

It is well established that support from both family and friends is instrumental for AYA throughout their cancer trajectory. 41 However, AYA with cancer experience challenges in maintaining current friendships. In a qualitative study conducted by Breuer et al., AYA experienced a lack of support from friends as they reduced or completely stopped contact over their illness trajectory. 42 Furthermore, a diagnosis of cancer and its treatment may impair their ability to stay connected with peers through social activities and work/school attendance. A unique type of support that is considered valuable to AYA is support from peer survivors. 43 In fact, AYA placed a significantly higher value on interacting with other survivors than support from family and friends. 44 This may be the case because survivors can provide advice on navigating challenges associated with cancer and the AYA can connect with them on a deeper level. Evidently, social support can be defined in a variety of ways. Perhaps, concerns related to social support were not appropriately defined and documented and hence not adequately recognized in our cohort, which we will endeavor to address in the future, especially regarding peer support mechanisms.",
