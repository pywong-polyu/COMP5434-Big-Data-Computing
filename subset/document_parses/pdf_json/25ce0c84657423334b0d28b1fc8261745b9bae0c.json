This method can be used in a Fitness For Duty system (FFD). The research focuses on determining the effect of external factors such as alcohol, drugs, and sleepiness on the Central Nervous System (CNS). The aim is to analyse how this behaviour is represented on iris and pupil movements and if it is possible to capture these changes with a standard NIR camera. The behaviour analysis showed essential differences in pupil and iris behaviour to classify the workers in \"Fit\" or \"Unfit\" conditions. The best results can distinguish subjects robustly under alcohol, drug consumption, and sleep conditions. The Multi-Layer-Perceptron and Gradient Boosted Machine reached the best results in all groups with an overall accuracy for Fit and Unfit classes of 74.0% and 75.5%, respectively. These results open a new application for iris capture devices.",

Working in rotating shifts at night can be a significant risk factor. Also, several studies performed in different regions such as the U.S., Australia, U.K., Japan and others, show an essential correlation between shift-work at night with alcohol and drug consumption, which can be considered as important triggers for occupational accidents [4] . Workplace alcohol and drug use and impairment directly affect an estimated 15% of the U.S. workforce; about 10.9% work under the influence of alcohol or with a hangover [5] . The Australian Government alcohol guidelines report shows 13% of shift-workers, and 10% of those on standard schedules reported consuming alcohol at risky levels for short-term harm [6] . It is essential to point out that these numbers are similar in different parts of the world.",

Alcohol and substance abuse disorders and their consequences on the heart, liver, immune system, and other organs are on the rise worldwide [8] . Which are made worse by the economic and health crisis generated by the COVID-19. According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) of the National Institute of Health's (NIH), alcohol, illicit drugs and tobacco cost between $600 billion and $740 billion per year via lost work productivity, crime, and healthcare [9] - [15] . Fatigue is estimated to cost employers another 136 billion dollars [16] - [19] . Only in the U.S. alone, the total cost of workplace injuries in 2019 was $171 billion. The cost per worker was $1,100, the cost per medically consulted injury was $42,000, while the cost per death was $1,2 million. Fatigue, drowsiness, and sleepiness caused about 22% of all injury crashes according to Road Safety Annual Report 2020 1 published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The percentage of fatal crashes caused by fatigue can reach up to 30%. Reported percentages can differs because it can be difficult to figure out whether fatigue played role in an accident. Nevertheless, these numbers can be underestimated. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that fatigue accidents cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product [20] . Hence, it is necessary to take proactive measures to prevent fatigue, alcohol consumption, and drug abuse from negatively affecting employees and companies.",

The Central Nervous System (CNS) controls the iris and pupil movements [23] . In this condition, the subject can not voluntarily change the pupil's or iris' movement. This action is initiated automatically in response to an external factor such as light, or an internal factor such as alcohol consumption, drug abuse or fatigue. On the other hand, iris recognition allows identifying and distinguishing one worker from another and, thus, guaranteeing that the measurement is from the worker under testing. Therefore, the iris and pupil are highly reliable to measure the fitness for duty of the subject. Hence, there is a need to develop an automated and reliable FFD model tool based on iris recognition framework [24] .",

The test method consists in applying a light stimulus to one eye and to capture the dynamics of constriction of both eyes. For extracting the pupil size profiles from the video sequences, a two-step methodology is described. In the first phase, the iris/pupil search within the image is performed. In the second stage, the image is cropped to perform pupil detection on a smaller image to improve time efficiency. The undesired pupil dynamics arising in the PLR are defined and evaluated. A spontaneous oscillation of the pupil diameter is observed in the range [0, 2] Hz, and the accommodation reflex causes pupil constriction of about 10% of the iris diameter. A set of features is introduced to compare the two populations of responses and is used to design a Support Vector Machine classifier to discriminate between \"Sober\" and \"Drunk\" states.",

            "text": "The PMI-FIT2000 2 uses eye-tracking and pupilometry to identify impaired physiological states due to fatigue and other factors, such as alcohol or drug use. The test requires one minute to complete. The system employs an algorithm that compares an individual's established baseline to present state on four variables (i.e., pupil diameter, pupil constriction amplitude, pupil constriction latency & saccadic velocity). The baseline is established by the average of 10 trials taken during non-impaired conditions. After the baseline trials, each subsequent trial provides the user with scores on the four test components plus a composite score, the FIT Index. The PMI-FIT2000 has been used in multiple fatigues and impairment studies in other contexts, such as motor vehicle operation. Note that this system does not perform biometric recognition. Sobereye 3 is a portable device used to predict impairment caused by substance abuse or fatigue. It uses a smartphone attached to an opaque enclosure that fits a user's eyes to measure the PLR. The PLR is an involuntary reflex that changes the size of the pupil when the eyes are exposed to light. A high-intensity light will cause the pupil to constrict, and low-intensity light will cause the pupil to dilate. The user holds the enclosure over the eyes for one minute before any measurements are taken. This time allows the pupils to dilate. After the camera flash turns on for four seconds, a video is taken at 60 frames per second in full high definition resolution (1920 \u00d7 1080pix). Like other FFD examinations identifying a PLR alteration requires establishing a PLR baseline for each employee. The process of establishing a PLR baseline takes 10 days (starts of the workday) to monitor the typical day to day PLR variations. After about ten tests, an employee's PLR baseline is established. The baseline is then stored and used as a reference for future tests. By comparing day to day measurements and calculations to the baseline, PLR alterations can be identified. A standard scoring system is used to evaluate the degree 2. http://www.pmifit.com/ 3. https://www.sober-eye.com/ of PLR alteration. An employee can be classified as either \"High Risk\" or \"Low Risk.\" This measure indicates the probability of the employee being affected by impairment due to an altered PLR. Additionally, Sobereye uses iris recognition [45] .",

The binocular NIR image sequences captured correspond to the periocular area (eye mask) to obtain both eyes, pupils, iris, and sclera (see Figure 1 ). Other images were acquired using a monocular capture device to get the area corresponding to each eye separately. For the acquisition of the image sequences, the subject stays in front of the capture device, the equipment detects the eyes and starts the recording (see Figure 2 ).

These networks output a mask that highlights pixels that belong to the iris and the pupil in the images. In order to use this information, we employ pupil and iris localisation algorithms, which find the centres and the radii of the circles that best adapt the pupil and iris contours by using the mask as input. This method employs the morphological erosion operation and a XOR function to find the shape of the valid iris area. Then, the mean square error was used to determine the circle that best fits the right pupil and iris. The outputs are the radii and centres of pupil and iris in pixels for each image in the sequences (see Figure 7) . ",

Thus, it is possible to define the baseline behaviour curve for people in Fit and Unfit conditions. Note that this analysis shows the average behaviour, so it is not possible to use it as a single variable to separate the classes. Figure 10 present two plots with the differences in the temporal behaviour of pupil for X and Y axes, with a greater radius size (more significant dilation) in alcohol and drug subjects, followed by sleep deprivation records. In contrast, control subjects have the lowest dilation levels. All curves show an initial period with a pronounced increase in pupil radius size due to the natural adjustment process by the effect of the capture device. Then, control subjects tend to stabilise and produce a slower dilation level. In contrast, in the unfit cases, the dilation trend curves present a higher slope, being especially pronounced in the case of the alcohol records. The behaviour of sleep recordings is closer to control subjects. Figure 11 shows the behaviour of the iris throughout the sequence. In contrast to the pupil (Figure 10 ), the iris does not show a significant variation for control subjects with respect to the other classes. This makes sense, as the iris size should not change, except in some pathologies such as uveitis (inflammation of iris). Although the curves show a slight shift in the iris size, this effect should be to the unfit subjects; these tend to keep closed eyes and blink more times, and in many cases, to move in front of the capture device. This action makes the segmentation process difficult and, therefore, the estimation of the iris radius. This effect is not evident in the case of the pupil due to its smaller size. In the case of the radii values measured along the horizontal axis, as pointed out above, it is not possible to establish significant differences between the classes, which is correct. Also, there is no eye closure effect in this direction. However, the impact of partial eye closure appears in the case of iris radius estimation along the vertical axis. This effect is more marked in drugged subjects, who present a completely different curve than the other classes, with considerably smaller iris sizes. This effect is because subjects under the influence of drugs (mainly marijuana) tend to have droopy eyelids, and therefore the estimation of the iris size is affected. On the other hand, the difference in the beginning values recording in both analysed axes is due to the natural adjustment process subject in front of the capture device.",

In the case of sleep-deprived subjects, a difference can be observed concerning the control group, but not very marked. This difference could be due to the low number of recordings of this type or the lack of subjects with total sleep deprivation or night shift schedule work. Subjects who have consumed alcohol and drugs show the highest ratios, which means a very significant pupil dilation. The iris size effect described above for the drug recordings on the vertical axis is reflected in the estimation of the pupil-iris ratio in this group, showing the most significant difference when the analysis is made along this axis. Figures 13 and 14 show a movement analysis of the subjects in front of the captured device at the recorded time. It is expected that fit subjects can keep a better posture in front of the capture device during the recording than unfit subjects who should exhibit more significant movements in all directions. Figure 13 presents the estimation of the distance of the pupil and iris centres concerning the (0,0) position of the image. It can be seen that in the control cases, the subject tends to maintain a more stable posture throughout the registration. In contrast, the behaviour is more erratic for the unfit subjects, with constant movements in front of the capture device and moving away from the established reference point. Figure 14 shows a similar analysis. In this case, the position of the pupil centre concerning the image is observed. The control and alcohol subjects show similar and relatively stable behaviours for the pupil centre position in the image. Conversely, the subjects with sleep deprivation and those who have consumed drugs show more eye movements in the image. Moreover, the centre position is completely displaced in the horizontal axis for the drugs case, which shows the subject's movement in front of the capture device.",
