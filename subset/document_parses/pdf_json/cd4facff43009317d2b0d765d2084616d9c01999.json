A significant amount of research has been done on human coronaviruses, due to relatively recent outbreaks of zoonotic viruses such as SARS, MERS and the current SARS-CoV2 (etiologic agent of COVID-19) (Peiris et al., 2003; Hayden et al., 2014; Menachery et al., 2015; Wan et al., 2020) . Due to high economic losses, coronaviruses of agricultural animals have also been a focus of research. Coronaviruses infect diverse cell types, such as epithelial and various immune cells (Rossen et al., 1995; Totura et al., 2015) . Consequently, host innate immune responses have become of particular interest due to the lack of effective vaccines and the strong innate immune component in pathogenesis (Frieman et al., 2008; Totura and Baric, 2012; Shi et al., 2014) .",

Human coronaviruses have been shown to target apoptotic pathways, with virally induced apoptosis occurring in immune cells and target tissues (Collins, 2002; Krahling et al., 2009; Chu et al., 2016) . Viral proteins, such as SARS-CoV S, N, E, M, ORF-6, 7a and 9b, activate pro-apoptotic pathways (Lim et al., 2016) . Other interactions of the virus with the immune system involve immune evasion of the virus and preventing a robust innate immune response. Several members of the coronavirus family have been shown to inhibit innate immune responses by targeting IFN type I (Spiegel et al., 2005; Kint et al., 2016) . Other pathways, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses, autophagy, MAPK, and NF\u03baB are modulated by coronaviruses (Fung et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2014; Lim et al., 2016) , and these modulations enable the virus to efficiently replicate. Insight into these modulations will further elucidate the pathogenesis of these viruses.",

Host-pathogen interactions have not been studied extensively due to the complex pathogenesis and development of clinical disease. Two feline coronaviruses feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) exist which manifest with different pathologies. The enteric virus, FECV, commonly causes an asymptomatic infection presenting with mild gastrointestinal signs, and can persist in certain individuals (Pedersen et al., 1981) . When the infection turns pathogenic, a highly fatal systemic immune-mediated disease develops, so-called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (Pedersen et al., 1981) .

The absence of a robust cellmediated immunity is likely responsible for the fatal outcome of the viral infection. In cats with confirmed FIP, serum tests showed increased inflammatory cytokine expression, and clinical signs are closely correlated with inflammation (Pedersen, 1976 (Pedersen, , 2019 Dean et al., 2003; Kipar et al., 2006) .",

Transcriptome studies based on next-generation sequencing have the potential to elucidate the early responses of cells after viral infection and, consequently, give further insight into the pathogenesis of viruses (Radford et al., 2012) . Since both FIPV and FECV pathotypes replicate similarly in Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells, analyzing the transcriptome of these cells can provide information on replication of the virus and hostpathogen interactions. Recent studies have investigated host responses to FIPV via transcriptome studies in CRFK cells after infection (Harun et al., 2013; Mehrbod et al., 2015) . In one of these studies, the gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infected cats (Harun et al., 2013) was also investigated. However, due to the important role of immune cells in the disease, analyzing the responses of macrophages is critical to better understanding innate immune responses to feline coronavirus.",

These included, but were not limited to, several viral pathways (Kaposi, cytomegalovirus, HIV, Epstein-Barr, Hepatitis, Measles, Influenza, and others), \"viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor, \" \"Toll-like receptor signaling, \" \"NF-kappa B signaling, \" \"JAK-STAT signaling\" and many more that play a role in host responses to viral infections (Supplementary Table S5) . Overall, 32 pathways were enriched for upregulated genes at 17 h post-infection, with the large majority of these having immunological significance, particularly in the host response to viral infection. The network shows strong interactions between many immunological pathways, specifically those involved in host-virus signaling and interaction. Major nodes are Toll-like receptor signaling, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways, and several other virally induced pathways. A multi-color node means that genes within that labeled category are also placed/present in other associated higher hierarchy terms, represented by their respective colors elsewhere in the network. The top 20 terms for downregulated genes were very similar to the top terms at 2 h, with many processes related to neuronal and cellular development, organization, and differentiation. (B) For upregulated genes, the top 20 terms were similar to enrichment terms at 2 h in regards to neuronal and cellular responses. Additional terms found were \"response to the virus,\" \"defense response to the virus,\" and the \"semaphoring-plexin signaling pathway.\" Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org Cytoscape network analysis did not show significant interaction of nodes among downregulated pathways ( Figure 3A ). Network analysis of upregulated pathways at this time point shows strong interactions of several immunological and viral pathways, such as \"Toll-like receptor signaling, \" \"RIG-I receptor signaling, \" and many other immunological/viral pathways ( Figure 3B) .",

The implication was that FECV was present only in the intestines, while FIPV would now replicate mainly in monocytes, and that the infected monocytes subsequently cause the disease by transporting the virus systemically. However, FECV has been shown to be present systemically in monocytes (Kipar et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 2010) and FIPV can be present in the intestines without being infectious (Pedersen et al., 2012) . Ex vivo studies on monocytes/macrophages host responses have been limited by the fact that the presence of the virus is extremely low, in only about 0.2-2% of infected cells (Dewerchin et al., 2005) . We previously demonstrated that at 2 h, the virus is taken up by the macrophages, as evidenced by the presence of viral RNA, but were not able to observe a significant increase of viral RNA at 17 h using RNA sequencing, while even limited uptake of the virus into CRFK cells led to several log fold of replication (Drechsler et al., 2020) . This discrepancy in viral amplification in the two cell types, combined with their different function, most likely accounts for the pronounced difference observed in gene expression in this analysis.",

In macrophages, those two pathways were part of a larger network of connected pathways. At 17 h, this difference was even more pronounced, with few pathways enriched for CRFK, while macrophage pathways form a larger network of several pathways.

            "text": "It has been shown that viral miRNAs of DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus, interfere with several host signaling pathways, including axon guidance, cell growth, and cell differentiation (Carl et al., 2013) . Herpesviruses are not necessarily replicating in neurons though, but rather enter and go latent, so interfering with neuronal pathways might be a feature of latency in those cases. Recent studies imply that RNA viruses potentially also generate these viral miRNAs (Rouha et al., 2010) and it would appear that these consequently try to interfere with the host signaling. Up to one-third of cats with FIP manifest with neurological signs (Foley et al., 1998) and coronaviruses of several species have been shown to be neurotropic (Bergmann et al., 2006) . Therefore, it is of interest that this pathway is targeted by the virus. Further studies are needed to better understand the viral host interaction with regards to these neuronal pathways, particularly considering that this was more pronounced in CRFK, and less so in macrophages. Another function that was clearly targeted was cytoskeleton and associated functions. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to counter the host response, including the reorganization of host organelles to form viral replication sites, generation of viral countermeasures, and the assembly, transport, and release of new viral particles (Naghavi and Walsh, 2017) . This involves the host's cytoskeleton and microtubules, which is what was seen in the gene expression in response to the virus in both cell types. By differentially regulating these pathways, the virus is hijacking the normal functions involved in cellular homeostasis and using them to its advantage. Among the 10 most significantly downregulated genes at 2 or 17 h, there was no overlap between the cell types. In both, CRFK and macrophages, members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family were downregulated. However, the subtypes were different, hnRNP K in CRFK and hnRNP U and D respectively in macrophages. Proteins from the hnRNP family play important roles in mRNA processing, RNA metabolism, and transport and are host factors important in the replication of RNA viruses (Dinh et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2017) , so it does not seem surprising that the transcription of several of these proteins appears to be differentially regulated in both cell types by FIPV. Further investigation of specific subtypes and their role in feline coronavirus is warranted. In CRFK, the top downregulated gene at 17 h was talin 1, an integrin-associated protein needed for all integrin adhesive functions (Klapholz and Brown, 2017) . Integrins play an important role in cell signaling and recent research indicates that Hepatitis B degrades talin 1 to facilitate its replication (van de Klundert et al., 2016) , but much is still unknown about this protein and viral infection. In summary, many more genes and pathways are strongly downregulated in macrophages, but not CRFK, and there is almost no commonality in regards to those genes and pathways.",

Macrophages are innate immune cells generally hard to infect in vitro (Stoddart and Scott, 1989; Dewerchin et al., 2005; Shirato et al., 2018) . While epithelial cells generally function as part of the innate immune system in a wider sense, only macrophages are professional antigenpresenting cells and considered one of the most critical players in host-pathogen interactions. Epithelial cells, in general, are targets of coronavirus infection and CRFK cells have been used as the primary way to grow the virus in cell culture. However, it appears that macrophages might not serve as a primary cell to replicate the virus, and rather play a different role in the pathogenesis of the disease. This would have to be further investigated in vivo, where monocytes have been shown to be viremic, and release inflammatory factors that cause vasculitis, a key clinical factor in disease (Dewerchin et al., 2005) . It is conceivable that macrophages serve as a vehicle to transport the virus and consequently interact with or activate T cells. T cells are depleted in FIP affected cats, but the underlying mechanism is also not well understood. It has been suggested that macrophages are responsible for the apoptosis of T cells (Haagmans et al., 1996) , so further investigations of macrophage gene expression and the effect on T cells will be needed. Gene expression of monocytes/macrophages can give us further insight into the early responses of these critical immune cells to infection and subsequently elucidate the pathogenesis of FCoV infection leading to T cell depletion, inflammatory responses, and clinical disease. Comparisons of gene transcription in these immune cells important for antigen presentation and interaction with other immune cells to epithelial cells which are permissive for productive replication can possibly lead to discerning pathways relevant to pathogenesis in the early stages of infection.",
