Many of the women who develop these problems do not have risk factors, making complications which occur in pregnancy difficult to predict. The risk of pregnancy complications can be, in part, informed by the background rates of these events in any given population. However, data on background rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes may not always be available. 7 Hence, it is challenging for clinical investigators to know which prior and current pregnancy risk factors are appropriate study exclusion criteria. The selection of criteria for inclusion or exclusion of subjects in the study is among the more critical study design decisions. In early phase clinical trials, it is common to enroll the healthiest populations to minimize risk. As the product profile is better defined in later stage studies, a broader group of individuals are generally enrolled.

In clinical studies where there is a placebo or comparator group, similar frequency of obstetric adverse events is expected to occur in both groups. For Phase III trials, ideally the study population should mirror the target population. Exclusion criteria based on selection of women with low risk for obstetric complications can be too restrictive and limit the ability to assess safety of the vaccine in the populations who need it the most. Additionally, exclusion criteria may act indirectly to alter study results by excluding participants who would otherwise be at increased risk for a condition. For example, Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is considered an important cause of stillbirth and preterm labor globally. Eliminating pregnant women with a prior stillbirth or prior preterm labor from participation in clinical research on GBS may also impact efficacy results of an intervention and may add bias to the study. 58, 59 In fact, inclusion of \"higher risk\" populations may better allow the ability to demonstrate differences between vaccine and control and potentially make a vaccine available to women sooner.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1481, "end": 1484, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1485, "end": 1487, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Researchers should determine what population they will evaluate (such as healthy and at risk), Using the information provided in this manuscript and its supplements may actually be most useful for the design of the studies that are currently being planned for some emerging infections.

To our knowledge, this delination and frequency mapping of exclusion criteria based on a comprehensive search of prior maternal immunization trials has not been done previously. Adding stratification by study phase offers additional information for trialists.

However, given that a standardized approach to the selection of participants in studies of vaccines in pregnancy is necessary, this information may serve to help clinical researchers reassess how conservative they need to be as a product progresses in development. The balance between deciding exclusion criteria and choosing a study population that mirrors the general population is complex. As clinical trials for vaccines specifically designed for an indication in pregnant women are novel, initial early phase trials may have more strict exclusion criteria.

Appendix 2 is a summation of all exclusion factors included in these studies and risk factors in practice guidelines. The exclusion and risk factors were grouped by MedDRA criteria/organ system classification. Because the exclusion factors listed and referral risk factors were consistent, they were included in one matrix for ease of analysis. Exclusion Factors Tabulation: When evaluating the matrix, for all phases of studies and for the practice guidelines investigated, a few obstetric risk factors were most commonly chosen as exclusion criteria. These included general risk factors present during the current pregnancy such as advanced (over 35) or young (10-19 years) maternal age, and current alcohol or drug use; past obstetric history of congenital anomalies, hypertensive disease during pregnancy, perinatal death or stillbirth, prior preterm birth, and spontaneous abortion; current maternal medical conditions varying from HIV or other immunodeficiency, to psychiatric disorders (see BOX 1and Study Development Phase: More exclusion criteria were utilized in earlier phase clinical trials, as depicted in the overall heat map (Appendix 2) of potential factors. In Phase I/II trials (n=25), the number of exclusion criteria listed at least one time was 119. Thus far, the number of Phase 3 clinical trials in maternal immunization was limited (n=7). While the number of exclusion criteria (74 ) was less than in the Phase I/II trials, exclusion criteria were extensive.

Adverse outcomes may occur in normal low risk pregnancies without interventions. These obstetric risks do not imply an increased risk of vaccination. Therefore, a better understanding of obstetric risks may facilitiate not only a more informed choice of inclusion and exclusion criteria in these clinical studies of vaccines in pregnant women, but also a tailored use of obstetric risk criteria based on the phase of development of the vaccine. The field of maternal immunization has continued to evolve and rapidly expanded after the 2009 influenza pandemic. Because of obstetrics risks and the complexity of the maternal-fetal dyad, pregnant women have been considered a vulnerable population, excluded from participation in experimental trials of vaccines and drugs, particularly when these are not intended for the management of obstetric conditions. To facilitate inclusion of pregnant women in studies and research on immunizations targeting pregnant women, bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institues of Health have addressed and published guidance on inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials. Topics addressed have included ethical and consent consideration, 49 and development of standards for laboratory and physiologic parameters in pregnant women to assist in evaluation of outcomes in pregnant women participating in clinical trials. 50-54 General guidance on the conduct of research in pregnancy has been developed by the National Institutes of Health after conducting clinical trials of licensed and experimental vaccines since the 1980's, and global experience has been growing as more studies funded by industry and other organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are being pursued in all resource settings in the last decade. 1 Consensus statements, such as PREVENT, advocating for inclusion of pregnant women in vaccine trials are now published. 55 The exclusion of pregnant women and their infants from the benefits of potentially life-saving drugs and vaccines through clinical trials is no longer considered acceptable. 56,57 At present, vaccines specifically for use in pregnant women against at least two pathogens: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Group B Streptococcus (GBS), are in clinical development. Active evaluation of these and other vaccines for women during or prior to pregnancy is ongoing (eg. Pertussis, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Hepatitis E).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "understand the potential risks (obstetric risks versus vaccine risks), and wherever possible, utilize the background rates of certain obstetric, maternal and neonatal events of interest in the general population for interpretation and assessment of these risks to determine if vaccination would potentially increase the occurrence of these events above such expected background rates. While the assessment of exclusion criteria presented in this article does not differentiate obstetric risks from vaccine risks, the quantitation of risk may facilitate trialists' ability to consider appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria that reaches a balance between minimizing risk to participants and enabling inclusion of relevant populations. Its use may facilitiate not only a more informed choice of inclusion and exclusion criteria in these clinical studies of vaccines in pregnant women, but also a tailored use of these criteria based on the phase of development of the vaccine. Having more granular information about the obstetric risks, as provided in Appendix 3, may help trialists to anticipate the potential obstetric risks in each trimester. For instance, with spontaneous abortion risks mostly in the first trimester, or pre-eclampsia in the third trimester, a trialist could have a more accurate estimation of magnitude of adverse events, and consider these combined these considering the expected (background) risk in the studied population, the known or anticipated product safety profile, and the timing of the intervention (trimester of exposure) in pregnancy.
