            "text": "Background: As we age, the functioning of the human immune system declines. The results of this are increases in morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disease in elderly individuals, as well as a weakened vaccination response. The aging of the immune system is thought to affect and be affected by the human virome, the collection of all viruses present in an individual. Persistent viral infections, such as those caused by certain herpesviruses, can be present in an individual for long periods of time without any overt pathology, yet are associated with disease in states of compromised immune function. To better understand the effects on human health of such persistent viral infections, we must first understand how the human virome changes with age. We have now analyzed the composition of the whole blood virome of 317 individuals, 21-70 years old, using a metatranscriptomic approach. Use of RNA sequencing data allows for the unbiased detection of RNA viruses and active DNA viruses. Results: The data obtained showed that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the most frequently expressed virus, with other detected viruses being herpes simplex virus 1, human cytomegalovirus, torque teno viruses, and papillomaviruses. Of the 317 studied blood samples, 68 (21%) had EBV expression, whereas the other detected viruses were only detected in at most 6 samples (2%). We therefore focused on EBV in our further analyses. Frequency of EBV detection, relative EBV RNA abundance and the genetic diversity of EBV was not significantly different between age groups (21-59 and 60-70 years old). No significant correlation was seen between EBV RNA abundance and age. Deconvolution analysis revealed a significant difference in proportions of activated dendritic cells, macrophages M1, and activated mast cells between EBV expression positive and negative individuals. Conclusions: As it is likely that the EBV RNA quantified in this work is derived from reactivation of the latent EBV virus, these data suggest that age does not affect the rate of reactivation nor the genetic landscape of EBV. These findings offer new insight on the genetic diversity of a persistent EBV infection in the long-term.",

Resulting from this are increases in morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disease in elderly individuals, as well as a weakened vaccination response [1] . These age-related changes to the human immune system are referred to as immunosenescence. The disproportionate number of deaths of elderly individuals in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been a grim reminder of the susceptibility of older immune systems to novel pathogens [2] . Functionally, immunosenescence is associated with an increased rate and severity of infections, autoimmunity, and decreased response to vaccinations in elderly individuals [3] . At the cellular level, the hallmark of immunosenescence is the accumulation of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype of CD8 positive T cells, which have lost the CD28 antigen required as a co-stimulatory signal in T cell activation. In addition to this, the proportion of CD14 positive monocytes and macrophages is increased (associated with the general increase of inflammation, often called inflammaging) and the proportion of antibody-producing B cells is decreased [4, 5] .",

The human virome, the collection of all viruses present in an individual, is not limited to disease states, as chronic but asymptomatic viral infections are thought to be common [6] . The word infection is used here only to denote the presence of exogenous viruses in the body, as the viruses may be silent and inactive, without any form of active infection. However, study of viromes is challenging, especially due to the small size of viral genomes and the high degree of sequence similarity between them [7] .

For example, cytomegalovirus (CMV) is thought to add to the progressive accumulation of senescent dysfunctional Tcells, contributing to the frailty syndrome and mortality [9] . While EBV has been thought to have similar impact to immunosenescence as CMV [10] , the connections between EBV, immunosenescence and disease are not fully clear [5] . It is important to note that herpesvirus infections do have the potential to be severe, which usually occurs in conditions of immune immaturity, age-associated immune decline or immune dysregulation [11] . Herpesviruses establish persistent infections that are occasionally reactivated [5] . In case of persistent, latent CMV infection, monocyte differentiation results in the transcription of CMV genes without reactivation [12] . Identification of detrimental immunomodulatory elements of the microbiome is needed to better understand how the immune system ages and what could be done to slow its decline.",

Viral diversity is multifaceted, as it can be studied across hosts or within-hosts, it may change over time, and it exists on different levels such as species, strain and nucleotide level. The same individual human can be infected with multiple different strains of the same virus simultaneously [16] , while separate copies of viral genomes can have small, nucleotide level differences between copies. Within-host viral populations may evolve towards greater diversity for the sake of increasing readiness to adapt to new selective pressures [17] . Yet diversity may also be reduced over time as the more robust variants of the virus become increasingly dominant [18] . One example of the impact of viral diversity is seen with the COVID-19 variants and the significant differences seen between them in infectivity [19] .",

No significant difference in abundance was observed between the sexes (non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test, p = 0.64). Furthermore, no age-associated significant differences were seen in abundance when each sex was tested separately, as non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test resulted in a p-value of 0.26 for male sample donors and 0.41 for female sample donors.

Of the 317 studied blood samples, 68 (21%) had EBV expression, whereas the other viruses were only detected in at most 6 samples (2%). Therefore, for most of the viruses detected in this study, with the exception of EBV, the frequency that they appear in the studied samples was too low to be able to make meaningful statistical comparisons between age groups. We therefore focused on EBV in our further analyses. Frequency of EBV detection, relative EBV RNA abundance and the genetic diversity of EBV was not significantly different between age groups (21-59 and 60-70 years old). Neither was a significant correlation seen between EBV RNA abundance and age of sample donor. This lack of significant difference between age groups and absence of significant correlation with age was true even when testing separately for male and female sample donors. The RNA-seq data used in this work measures frequency and magnitude of EBV reactivation rather than seroprevalence of EBV, as seroprevalence of EBV is likely to be very high in the individuals studied in this work (21-70 years old). EBV seroprevalence has been reported to be as high as 89% already in [18] [19] year olds [20] , meaning that seroprevalence of EBV between young adults and the elderly does not differ significantly. In this context, the results indicate that aging does not contribute to EBV reactivation.",

We observed RNA widely from EBV genome outside of the aforementioned latent genes, thus implying that this RNA expression results from EBV reactivation. With this interpretation, there was ongoing reactivation event in 21% of our samples.

In this context, we hypothesized that chronic infection would result in increased genomic diversity as seen in the acute infection. However, there was no significant age-associated difference in the EBV diversity, which implies that aged state differs from that of acute EBV infection. It is possible that our sample population was too young to reveal the age-associated chronic infectious state. It is also possible that nucleotide-level comparison using DNA sequencing would still indicate smaller scale differences, such as in a study by Weiss et al.

No significant correlation was seen between EBV RNA abundances and age. No significant differences were seen between the sexes, nor were there age-associated differences when tested separately for male and female sample donors.

The GTEx project as a whole is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and regulation. As part of the project, 17,382 samples have been collected from organ and tissue donors, originating from 54 types of tissue and from 948 individuals. Samples used in the project are collected from nondiseased tissue sites and are studied using primarily molecular assays, including WGS, WES, and RNA-Seq. The whole blood samples studied in this work originate from 317 persons. Each person contributed one sample and their age varied between 21 and 70 Fig. 2 Sample-wise total RNA abundances of HSV-1. Number of individuals where HSV-1 RNA was observed, was 5. Of these, four were considered old and one was young years. All donors were surgical patients or postmortem donors [37] . For whole blood collection the GTEx Tissue Harvesting Work Instruction states that the collection site preference is the femoral vein, while the subclavian vein and heart are other possible sites [38] . The Instruction also states that the preference of location will vary for organ donors (usually arterial line for beating heart donors) compared to non-beating heart tissue donors (venous route) [38] . Eligibility criteria and sequencing of biological samples has been described in more detail elsewhere [37, 38] .",

[25] was run in Puhti supercomputer cluster of CSC (Espoo, Finland). Paired-end RNAsequencingreads of 317 samples were downloaded from Sequence Read Archive in FASTQ format with SRA Toolkit (v2.10.8). Low-quality ends (Phred score < 20) and Illumina Universal Adapters were trimmed with TrimGalore (v0.6.4; https://github.com/ FelixKrueger/TrimGalore; 10.5.2021). Other quality filtering was performed with following qualifiers of PRINSEQ (lite v0.20.4) [40]: read length \u2265 50 nucleotides, mean quality score of read \u226525, proportion of ambiguous bases \u22641%, filter all kinds of duplicates, DUST score measuring low complexity \u22647. Quality filtering was confirmed with FastQC (v0.11.8; https:// www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc; 10.5.2021). Quality reads were subtracted sequentially by aligning them with STAR (v2.7.1a) [41] against human reference genome (GCF_000001405.26_GRCh38_genomic.fna from NCBI) and non-viral Human Microbiome Project genomes (2236 archae, bacterial and fungi genomes downloaded 15.11.2019 from NCBI)",
