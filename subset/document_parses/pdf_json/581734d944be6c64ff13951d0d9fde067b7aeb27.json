Prior to implementation of a web-based application for cancer family history collection, we aimed to review the quality of collected CFH in a gynecologic oncology outpatient clinic and determine contributing patient factors. Medical records were reviewed for 200 new patients presenting between 4/2019-7/2019. CFH was collected during the patient interview and evaluated for inclusion of eight elements based on standards set by the genetics community. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were utilized to evaluate the effect of patient characteristics on the number of relatives included in the CFH. Among our cohort of 200 patients, CFH was documented for 185 patients (92.5%). On univariate analysis, patients with a family history of cancer and prior genetic testing had significantly greater median number of relatives included in the CFH. On multivariable analysis, patients with family members with cancer had significantly more relatives included. Our data are consistent with the literature, suggesting that the current collection methods may not adequately capture all measures of a high quality CFH. Patients reporting no family history of cancer and those without prior genetic testing were least likely to have CFH that included key quality elements and these patients might benefit from health information technology CFH collection tools.",

For gynecologic cancer syndromes, including hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and Lynch syndrome, diagnosing familial mutations is critical, with implications for the health of the patient and at-risk relatives. Individuals with a cancer predisposition syndrome may be candidates for targeted therapies, increased cancer surveillance (e.g., breast and colon screening) and cancer prevention (e.g., salpingo-oophorectomy, mastectomy, colectomy), which can decrease cancer morbidity and mortality (Wood et al., 2014; Moore et al., 2018) . Multiple organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) have guidelines that rely on family history to prompt referral for genetic assessment (Hereditary Cancer Syndromes and Risk Assessment, 2019;Committee on Practice Bulletins-Gynecology CoG, Society of Gynecologic Oncology, 2017).",

To the best of our knowledge, there exists no prior literature on the quality and comprehensiveness of cancer family history in a gynecologic oncology setting.

A three-month time period was chosen to allow an appropriate number of new patients to matriculate. Standard of care was collection of CFH verbally during patient face-to-face interviews. For non-English speaking patients, a telephone interpreter was used for the collection of all health information. The CFH was transcribed into the electronic medical record (EMR) (EpicTogether) by attending physicians and physician assistants at the time of the visit.

Associations between categorical variables were evaluated using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate for category size.

There are approximately four million individuals in the U.S. with a deleterious mutation in a cancer-associated gene but fewer than 20% are aware of their underlying genetic condition and cannot take advantage of genetically targeted preventative cancer care (Childers et al., 2018) . Collection of accurate and comprehensive CFH is invaluable for identifying at-risk patients for triage to genetic counseling and testing. However, prior literature suggests that the current system of CFH collection results in data inadequate to accurately assess disease risk (Acton et al., 2000; Murff et al., 2007; Summerton and Garrood, 1997) . We found, in a population of patients presenting for a gynecologic oncology appointment, that CFH often lacks important quality elements.",

Patient age, ethnicity, and personal cancer history were not significantly associated with the quality of collected CFH. Not surprisingly, patients who were aware of a prior diagnosis of cancer in their family provided information on a greater number of relatives and were more likely to provide information on relatives' gender, relatives' lineage, pertinent negatives, and relatives' cause of death. Cancer diagnoses in families may prompt greater awareness and discussion among patients and their relatives. However, patients who are unaware of cancer diagnoses in their families could also benefit from a dedicated discussion of this topic with family members. Patients with prior genetic testing provided information on a greater median number of relatives and were more likely to include information on relatives' lineage, three generations, pertinent negatives, and age of relatives' cancer diagnosis. It seems plausible that patients with prior genetic testing previously underwent genetic assessment with a genetics provider, prompting in-depth discussion of family cancer history.",

There are patient-related barriers including lack of awareness of relatives' health, inaccuracies in recall, poor family communication, and language barriers in the medical setting. Conversely, clinician-related factors include inadequate time to collect CFH, lack of standardization, and lack of training needed for providers to feel confident collecting CFH and transforming the data into an appropriate management plan (Sussner et al., 2011) . There is no way to ascertain whether patient or clinician-related factors contributed more to deficiencies in documented CFH. Due to the small patient population, it also is difficult to fully assess the impact of race and ethnicity on CFH, but this is a topic that should be evaluated in future larger studies. Additionally, these data were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains to be seen how the emphasis on limiting a patient's in-person time with medical providers and on telemedicine will affect CFH collection.",

We have planned a prospective randomized trial utilizing health information technology to collect CFH versus standard of care (face-toface collection by a medical provider), as our data demonstrate that there is ample room for improvement. Health information technology has been shown to successfully improve clinical documentation, workflows, quality of care, patient safety, communication, and clinical decision support (Ritchie et al., 2020; Committee opinion no, 2015) . With the growing recognition that it is critically important to identify individuals with cancer-associated pathogenic variants, medical providers must review the quality of the CFH they collect, as we have done in this study, and use these results to drive innovation in patient care and preventative medicine.
