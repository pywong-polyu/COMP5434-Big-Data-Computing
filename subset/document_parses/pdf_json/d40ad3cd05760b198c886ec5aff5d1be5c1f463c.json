During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Singapore implemented large-scale institutional isolation units called Community Care Facilities (CCFs) to combat the outbreak in the community by housing low-risk COVID-19 patients from April to August 2020. The CCFs were created rapidly by converting existing public spaces and used a protocolized system, augmented by telemedicine to enable a low health care worker-patient ratio (98 health care workers for 3200 beds), to operate these unique facilities. In the first month, a total of 3758 patients were admitted to 4 halls, 4929 in-house medical consults occurred, 136 patients were transferred to a hospital, 1 patient died 2 weeks after discharge, and no health care workers became infected. This article shares the authors' experience in operating these massive-scale isolation facilities while prioritizing safety for all and ensuring holistic patient care in the face of a public health crisis and lean health care resources.",

The CCFs act as a step-down care facility after diagnosis and admit low-risk foreign workers from dormitories or patients who have recovered well in the hospital and have been discharged. Patients may stay in the CCF for up to 2 weeks and are then transferred to another step-down isolation facility to serve the rest of the minimum 21-day isolation period after diagnosis.",

CCF@Expo was partly modeled after the Fangcang shelter hospitals, the first large-scale COVID-19 isolation facilities, which were built quickly by modifying exhibition centers and stadiums in Wuhan, China (6 -9) . However, CCF@Expo's design included a few unique considerations. First, it served as an isolation facility rather than a hospital. As such, patients who were identified to be at risk for deterioration were sent to a general hospital for further evaluation and monitoring. Second, the staffing level at the facility was low to avoid overwhelming the health care system. Third, the facility served a unique population-foreign workers living in crowded dormitories who were predominantly non-English speaking and had low literacy rates.",
