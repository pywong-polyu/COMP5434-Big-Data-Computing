Although several drugs are expected to be useful as treatments for FIP, no drugs are available in clinical practice. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of combined use of adalimumab (an anti-human-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody, ADA) and itraconazole (ICZ), which are presently available to veterinarians. The neutralizing activity of ADA against fTNF-alpha-induced cytotoxicity was measured in WEHI-164 cells. Ten specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats were inoculated intraperitoneally with type I FIPV KU-2. To the cats that developed FIP, ADA (10 mg/animal) was administered twice between day 0 and day 4 after the start of treatment. ICZ (50 mg/head, SID) was orally administered daily from day 0 after the start of treatment. ADA demonstrated dose-dependent neutralizing activity against rfTNF-alpha. In an animal experiment, 2 of 3 cats showed improvements in FIP clinical symptoms and blood chemistry test results, an increase in the peripheral blood lymphocyte count, and a decrease in the plasma alpha 1-AGP level were observed after the beginning of treatment. One of the cats failed to respond to treatment and was euthanized, although the viral gene level in ascites temporarily decreased after the start of treatment. ADA was found to have neutralizing activity against rfTNF-alpha. The combined use of ADA and ICZ showed a therapeutic effect for experimentally induced FIP. We consider these drugs to be a treatment option until effective anti-FIPV drugs become available.",

            "text": "We previously reported that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays a critical role in the progression of FIP. TNF-alpha is produced excessively by FIPV-infected macrophages. TNF-alpha is involved in lymphopenia and increased levels of the cellular receptor of serotype II FIPV, aminopeptidase N (APN) [10, 11] . It has also been reported that neutrophil apoptosis in cats with FIP is inhibited by TNF-alpha [12] . This finding suggests that neutrophilia in cats with FIP is due to TNF-alpha-induced neutrophil survival. We previously reported that the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2-4, with high neutralizing activity against feline TNF-alpha (fTNF-alpha), is applicable as a treatment for FIP [13, 14] . However, anti-fTNF-alpha mAb has not been marketed and cannot be used clinically in animal hospitals. In human medicine, an anti-human-TNF-alpha mAb is used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease [15] . It is commercially available and can be used by veterinarians in their practice. However, whether this human antibody is effective against FIP, a cat disease, is unknown. Several antiviral agents have been reported for FIPV [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . These drugs have been confirmed to reduce the proliferation of FIPV, but they are not commercially distributed as veterinary drugs. We previously found that itraconazole (ICZ), which is used in veterinary medicine, reduces the proliferation of type I FIPV [21] [22] [23] . However, the therapeutic effects of ICZ in cats with FIP remain unclear.",

Total RNA was isolated from supernatant and cells from ascites using a High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using RNA-direct Realtime PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) with the specific primers 3'-UTR-F (5'-GGA GGT ACA AGC AAC CCT ATT-3') and 3'-UTR-R (5'-GAT CCA GAC GTT AGC TCT TCC-3') and a probe (FAM-5'-AGA TCC GCT ATG ACG AGC CAA CAA -3'-BHQ1). The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 20 \u03bcL/well in 48-well PCR plates using a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 90 \u00b0C for 30 s, 60 \u00b0C for 20 min, and 95 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 45 cycles of 90 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. To obtain control RNA for quantification, cDNA fragments amplified with primers 3'-UTR-F and 3'-UTR-R were cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The linearized and purified plasmid was transcribed using a RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System-T7 (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of transcribed RNA was measured using a spectrophotometer. Tenfold dilutions of the RNA transcript, ranging from 1 \u00d7 10 1 to 1 \u00d7 10 9 copies/\u03bcL, were prepared with 10 ng of MS2 RNA per mL. The RNA copy number was calculated following the procedure described by Fronhoffs et al. [25] .

However, it is costly and time-consuming for anti-fTNF-alpha mAb to be approved as a veterinary drug in each country. We therefore focused on an anti-human TNF-alpha mAb that is already being used to treat human inflammatory diseases. Before conducting animal experiments, we examined whether the anti-human-TNF-alpha mAb can neutralize fTNF-alpha. ADA, which is an anti-human-TNF-alpha mAb, demonstrated dose-dependent neutralizing activity against rfTNF-alpha, similar to anti-fTNF-alpha mAb 2-4. The nine anti-fTNF-alpha mAbs that we reported previously had an IC 50 ranging from 5 to 700 ng/mL against rfTNF-alpha at the same concentration [13] . The IC 50 of ADA (36.9 \u00b1 23.4 ng/mL) suggests that it has high neutralizing activity against fTNF-alpha compared with these anti-fTNF-alpha mAbs. Generally, mAbs against human cytokines show no cross-reactive neutralizing activity against animal cytokines. However, Aguirre et al. reported that human and feline TNFalpha have similar neutralizing epitopes [26] . Furthermore, the deduced amino acid sequence of human TNF-alpha is 89.7% identical to that of feline TNF-alpha, and 10 of 12 residues that interact with ADA are present in both [27] . This appears to be the reason that adalimumab has potent neutralizing activity against feline TNF-alpha.",

ADA (10 mg/animal) was administered intravenously to the three cats on day 0 and within 4 days after the start of treatment. In addition, ICZ (50 mg/animal) was orally administered daily starting on day 0 of treatment. In cats 2 and 3, improvements in clinical symptoms and blood chemistry test results, increases in the peripheral blood lymphocyte count, and decreases in the plasma alpha 1-AGP level were observed after the beginning of treatment. Symptomatic improvements were observed between 1 and 2 weeks after the start of treatment. Furthermore, in cats 2 and 3, no ascites or pyogenic granulomas were observed pathologically at the end of the experiment, and no changes suggestive of the recurrence of FIP were observed until the end of the treatment period. Cat no. 6 failed to respond to treatment and was euthanized, although the viral gene level in ascites temporarily decreased after the start of the treatment. These VEGF is produced by FIPV-infected macrophages and improves the permeability of feline endothelial cells [28] . In cats with FIP, the plasma VEGF level is correlated with the amount of ascites. Cat no. 6, in which ascites was evident by gross examination and palpation (160 mL of ascites was collected at euthanasia), had a high plasma VEGF level of \u2265 100 pg/mL for 3 weeks. However, in cats 2 and 3, in which no signs of ascites were noted, the plasma VEGF level remained low or only increased temporarily.

As increases in liver enzymes are observed in cats with FIP, the development of adverse effects after ICZ administration was of concern. However, in cats 2 and 3, liver function marker levels, which increased during treatment progression, returned to the normal range, and plasma jaundice disappeared. Therefore, no adverse effects of ICZ were observed. Thus, from the Fig. 9 Blood chemistry panel. The white areas of the graphs represent the normal ranges. \u2020: The cat was euthanized because its clinical condition had reached the humane endpoint viewpoint of adverse effects, the administration of ICZ is considered to be safe for FIP cats.",

GC-376 and GS-441524 are efficacious drugs that produce therapeutic effects in 30-80% of FIP cats. Although these drugs are expected to be useful as treatments for FIP, they have not been approved. Therefore, no drugs are available in clinical practice for the treatment of FIP. In this study, we demonstrated that the combined use of ADA and ICZ, which are presently available to veterinarians, is effective for the treatment of FIP. We consider these drugs to be a treatment option until antiviral drugs such as GC-376 and GS-441524 become available. In addition, these antiviral drugs exert therapeutic effects on FIP by mechanisms different from those of ADA and ICZ [16, 18, 21, 23] . In the future, the evaluation of the therapeutic effects of their concomitant use may aid in the development of more-effective treatments for FIP.",
