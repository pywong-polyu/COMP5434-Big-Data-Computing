The hospitality industry has become of growing importance to the global economy, and the COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the industry's vulnerability. The hospitality industry involves a large number of customers and employees and high exposure to both national and international guests, which dramatically increases the potential for exposure to and spreading of infections (Leung & Lam, 2004) . However, the COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing event and only a few previous studies have focused on the impact of public health crises on the hospitality industry, as most research has focused on economic rather than public health crises (Mair et al., 2014; Jian et al., 2017) .",

According to Schroeder and Pennington-Gray (2014) public health-related crises, such as epidemics, are always covered by the media in a negative light. Countries heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic went as far as to close down (Tanne et al., 2020) . In 2020, travel restrictions took effect across the globe, creating an economic crisis of unprecedented magnitude (Tanne et al., 2020; Fernandes, 2020) . In Israel, 82% of all employment is in the service sector (Plecher, 2020a) . In Sweden, 65% of gross domestic product (GDP) is generated by the service sector (Plecher, 2020b) . In the United States, the service industry is responsible for 77% of GDP and is one of the largest job creators (Duffin, 2020) .",

            "text": "As the global economy moves from a manufacturing economy toward a service economy, the of study of hospitality crisis management is crucial for two reasons. First, overreliance on revenue from the hospitality industry can be devastating (Israeli and Reichel, 2003) , as lost revenue contributes to a downward economic trend and increased unemployment (Henderson, 2007; Karsavuran, 2020) . The second reason is that the way a country, industry, or company manages its recovery plays a significant role in how well that country, industry, or company emerges from a crisis (Racherla and Hu, 2009) . As Racherla and Hu state, \"An organization's crisis management capabilities should be of such quality that an evolving crisis can be resolved quickly and prevented from spreading to the extent possible\" (2009 p. 562) . The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing event so understanding its full impact on the international hospitality industry from a leadership perspective and its potential consequences are not yet fully understood. This qualitative study has three aims: 1) to examine the opinions and viewpoints of hospitality leaders on the impact of COVID-19 on their personal life, the company they work for, the hospitality industry, their country, and the world, using Social Systems Theory (SST); 2) to evaluate what actions were taken to ameliorate effects of 3) to evaluate whether perceptions of COVID-19's effects on the hospitality industry vary, using Hofstede's five cultural dimensions. In the following sections, the literature is revised with further explanations that justify the proposed prediction.",

The impact of these outbreaks on the hospitality industry in the affected countries was enormous. Some researchers have studied the effects of such outbreaks on the hospitality and restaurant industry. For example, in 1976, Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia experienced a fatal Legionnaires' disease outbreak and closed four months later due to a drop in bookings, which went from 80% occupancy to as low as 3% (Markel, 2018) . In 1993, the Jack-in-the-Box restaurant company in Fan Francesco experienced a large-scale E. coli outbreak, which nearly bankrupted the company (Andrews, 2013) .",

The outbreak caused an unprecedented move by the WHO: after 45 years, it issued a \"general travel advisory\" that closed borders and discouraged travel to affected areas. China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Singapore lost an estimated US$20 billion in GDP and three million jobs in the tourism sector (Kuo et al., 2008) . Many destinations experienced dramatic declines in revenue and visitor numbers. Toronto, Canada, lost 4.5 million dollars in revenue over the same period the year before, and in 2004 Asia saw a 70% decline in tourist arrivals (McKercher and Chon, 2004; Rosszell, 2003) .

It is concerned with the interaction or relationship between each subgroup (Dossa, 1990) . SST posits that the components (parts) of the system are interconnected, and what happens in one component affects the others and the system as a whole. The foundation of SST is communities (Reicherter and Billek-Sawhney, 2003) . While SST has not been extensively used in hospitality and tourism research, it was employed by Reicherter and Billek-Sawhney (2003) as a tool for analyzing social systems and emphasizing the need for older adult communities to promote welfare among the community and residents (Reicherter and Billek-Sawhney, 2003) . SST was used to examine the interrelations between individuals and their communities, such as hospitality organizations, the hospitality industry, the country, and the world as they relate to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The five dimensions are individualism vs collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs. femininity and long-term vs. short-term orientation. In 2010, Hofstede et al. (2010) added a sixth dimension by the name of indulgence vs. restraint. and Crotts and Pizam (2003) found that national cultures affect the evaluation of travel services and ultimately the willingness to do repeat purchases. Furthermore, Crotts and Erdmann (2000) p. 417) provided in their study \"tentative evidence in support of Hofstede's conceptual framework that national culture influences consumers' willingness to report dissatisfaction.\" Respondents from highly masculine societies with dominant traits being achievement, assertiveness, and material rewards more often showed a willingness to report dissatisfaction than respondents from low to moderately masculine societies. Ahlawat (2016) study concludes that Hofstede's scorecard for each country can provide human resource managers better insight into the employees' countries culture while also helping to manage various aspects of human resource management practices. Kristjansdottir (2019) found that Hofstede's cultural dimensions suggested that only uncertainty avoidance and individualism positively impacted tourism inflow, while power distance, masculinity, and orientation had a negative impact on tourism. Litvin (2019) found that prior research has indicated that Hofstede's cultural dimensions of uncertainty avoidance explain travel planning and vacation behaviors. Furthermore, current research indicates that cultural dimensions also explains post-trip attitude and satisfaction. Each country in comparison to each other will vary; for instance, Israel's data may be skewed as they have such a large immigrant population, and new citizens change the existing values (Hofstede Insights, 2020) .",

Low scores on this dimension reflect a normative society that honors traditions and is skeptical of change, while high scores reflect pragmatism and looking to the future in an open-minded way. Both the USA (26) and Israel (38) are considered normative societies. Israel's score supports its high score in the uncertainty avoidance dimension: Israelis do not stray from traditional culture and focus on the present. Americans tend to validate the information in search of the truth, making them practical rather than pragmatic. Sweden (46) shows no preference for a pragmatic or normative approach (Hofstede Insights, 2020) .",

The COVID-19 pandemic is novel so not much is known about the evolving and increasing crisis. In the instance of novel problems where understanding must be developed about how things are happening, qualitative research is more appropriate than quantitative research (Strauss and Corbin, 1998; Tetnowski and Damico, 2001; Kaushal and Srivastava, 2020) . This study used non-probability criterion sampling, which seeks cases that meet some criterion that is useful for quality assurance . The key criterion for inclusion was a formal leadership position (in a top or high-level management position), working in the USA, Israel, or Sweden, and employed in the hospitality industry. Beyond these critical factors, we recorded other demographic aspects that might influence findings, such as position, level of education, marital status, and gender. We did not aim to collect a generalizable sample, but we did seek a homogeneous criterion for a comparative sample from three countries. Consequently, we recruited people in leadership positions or business owners for a valid comparison. Further, for ethical reasons, we left it optional for participants to report their income, and we did not ask about sexual orientation to avoid the perception of segmentation or purposeful selection and to show sensitivity. Most participants willingly identified their gender, marital status, and education but did not disclose their income. All names and affiliations are kept confidential (Fig. 1) .",
