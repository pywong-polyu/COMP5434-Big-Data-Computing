            "text": "This study reports a comprehensive empirical investigation of the nature and correlates of anti-mask attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accumulating evidence underscores the importance of facemasks, as worn by the general public, in limiting the spread of infection. Accordingly, mask wearing has become increasingly mandatory in public places such as stores and on public transit. Although the public has been generally adherent to mask wearing, a small but vocal group of individuals refuse to wear masks. Anti-mask protest rallies have occurred in many places throughout the world, sometimes erupting violently. Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between anti-mask attitudes and mask non-adherence and little is known about how such attitudes relate to one another or other factors (e.g., non-adherence to social distancing, anti-vaccination attitudes). To investigate these issues, the present study surveyed 2,078 adults from the US and Canada. Consistent with other surveys, we found that most (84%) people wore masks because of COVID-19. The 16% who did not wear masks scored higher on most measures of negative attitudes towards masks. Network analyses indicated that negative attitudes about masks formed an intercorrelated network, with the central nodes in the network being (a) beliefs that masks are ineffective in preventing COVID-19, and (b) psychological reactance (PR; i.e., an aversion to being forced to wear masks). These central nodes served as links, connecting the network of anti-masks attitudes to negative attitudes toward SARSCoV2 vaccination, beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, disregard for social distancing, and political conservatism. Findings regarding PR are important because, theoretically, PR is likely to strengthen other anti-masks attitudes (e.g., beliefs that masks are ineffective) because people with strong PR react with anger and counter-arguments when their beliefs are challenged, thereby leading to a strengthening of their anti-mask beliefs. Implications for improving mask adherence are discussed.",

The most common of the assessed reasons for not wearing masks were: Not believing that masks are effective, finding masks uncomfortable, difficulty establishing the habit of mask wearing, and lack of concern about COVID-19 [14, 15, 17, 31] . Newspaper reports of protest rallies offer additional, anecdotal information on antimasks sentiments. Several reasons for not wearing masks were suggested by news reports of anti-mask protests: Beliefs that masks violate civil liberties, beliefs that masks are ineffective and possibly harmful because masks make breathing difficult, and beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated [3, 20, 22, 23, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Despite the range of anti-mask attitudes, a common theme running through these reports is that protestors believe that mandatory masks are a violation of civil rights. In other words, anecdotal news reports suggest that the rallies are motivated, at least in part, by a phenomenon known as psychological reactance (PR).",

Accordingly, non-adherence to wearing masks is a socially important phenomenon as well as one that is relevant to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, the study of mask nonadherence during the COVID-19 pandemic has been largely limited, with some exceptions discussed later [50, 51] , to a small number of opinion polls, with a limited assessment of antimasks attitudes.

The final aim was to investigate how anti-mask attitudes are related to attitudes and behaviors that are associated with non-adherence to other pandemiccontrol measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as disregard for social distancing and anti-vaccination attitudes. Recent research provides evidence for a COVID-19 disregard \"syndrome\" [52] . This is not a syndrome in the medical sense of the term, but rather a constellation of inter-related attitudes and beliefs. People with this syndrome tend to (a) believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has been exaggerated, (b) see themselves as physically robust to any illness they may experience as a result of being infected with SARSCoV2, and (c) tend to disregard social distancing because they see it as unnecessary [52] . This syndrome is also associated with negative attitudes toward a potential vaccine for SARSCoV2 (i.e., beliefs that a vaccine is unnecessary or that the benefits of such a vaccine are outweighed by the potential risks) [52] .",

The remaining aims were address by network analyses, which are well-suited for gaining insights into the complex interplay among variables. Network analysis provides important information about relationships among elements (nodes) in a network (e.g., sets of attitudes or behaviors). Network analysis assumes that nodes are inter-related because they are, in some way, causally linked with one another. In network analysis, the links are known as \"edges.\" The presence of statistically significant edges does not assume that nodes are influenced by some underlying factor such as a latent variable. Instead, network analysis assumes that nodes may directly influence one another [53] . In the present study, anti-mask attitudes were predicted to form a network of interconnected nodes. Given that PR theoretically amplifies the strength of other attitudes, mask-related PR was predicted to be one of the central nodes in the network of mask-related attitudes. Network analyses were also conducted to determine how the network of anti-mask attitudes is related to other variables: Political conservativism, the elements of the COVID-19 disregard syndrome, and SARSCoV2 anti-vaccination attitudes. If nodes causally influence one another, then changes in a central node are most likely to lead to changes in other nodes in the network through the spreading of activation. Central nodes, as compared to peripheral nodes, are defining features of a network. Identifying central nodes has the potential to inform which elements to target in interventions. As a caveat, note that network analyses in crosssectional designs such as the present study are suggestive of, but do not establish causality. Significant edges might represent causal influences (either unidirectional or directional) but experimental designs are needed to establish causality. Accordingly, network analyses provide a source of hypotheses about causal links among variables in a network.",

How attentive were you when responding?\": \"Very Inattentive\" to \"Very Attentive\"). Participants were included only if they provided correct responses to three or more of the four attention checks (e.g., \"Strongly agree\" or \"Very attentive\"), indicating that they were sufficiently attentive.

Indices of centrality, also calculated with qgraph, were used to assess the relative importance of each node in the network [60] . Three indices of centrality were computed: Strength, betweenness, and closeness. Strength refers to how well a node is directly connected to other nodes in the network. Node strength is computed as the sum of the absolute values of edge weights (regularized partial correlations) that directly connect that node with other nodes. Closeness refers to how well a node is indirectly connected to other nodes in the network. Closeness is calculated by computing, for a given node, the inverse sum of edge weights for the shortest path between that node and each other node, and then summing the values for these paths. Betweenness refers to how important a given node is in the average path between two other nodes; that is, how often a given node is the most efficient (shortest) path between other nodes. This is an index of the importance of a given node in connecting nodes with one another. The stability (reliability) of the relative order of magnitude of edge weights and their strengths were tested by the correlation of stability coefficient, also calculated via bootnet [53] . Coefficients exceeding.50 suggest stable (reliable) results [53] . Due to the number of statistical tests conducted in this study, the \u03b1 level was set at.01 instead of the conventional.05.",

Negative attitudes about masks were largely uncorrelated with demographic variables (see S1 Appendix). Wearing of masks because of concerns about COVID-19 was also largely unrelated to demographic variables (see S1 Appendix). That is, mask wearing (coded 1 = yes, 0 = no) was uncorrelated with age, gender, education level, and employment status (rs ranged from -.03 to.02; see S1 Appendix). Mask wearing was significantly correlated with ethnic minority (non-White) status, but the correlation was very small (r = .07, p < .001). Mask wearing also had a small but significant correlation with country (coded as 1 = Canada, 2 = US); r = .13, p < .001). That is, significantly more people from the US than Canada reported wearing masks (90% vs. 78%). This may have reflected the significantly higher per capita prevalence of COVID-19 disease and mortality in the US than Canada at the time the study was conducted (i.e., late July/early August, 2020). At that time, Canada was classified as a moderate mortality country and the US a high mortality country, with the estimated number of deaths per 100,000 people being 25 for Canada and 60 for the US [61] . Table 1 provides details about the degree of endorsement of negative attitudes about masks. People who did not wear masks because of COVID-19 tended to have more negative attitudes about masks as compared to people who wore masks. People who did not wear masks were most likely to report that they did not like being forced to wear a facemask (i.e., mask-related PR), believed that masks were ineffective and possibly harmful, believed that masks had adverse interpersonal effects, found masks to be esthetically unappealing, and found mask wearing to be an inconvenient habit to form (see Table 1 ).",

The core reasons identified in the present study are remarkably similar to the reasons voiced in 1919 by the Anti-Mask League; that is, respondents in 2020, just like those in 1919, believed that masks were ineffective and violated their civil liberties. Fig 2 shows that the network of anti-mask attitudes is linked, via its central nodes (mask-related PR and beliefs that masks are ineffective), to other variables such disregard for social distancing and anti-vaccination attitudes.

If a person refuses to wear a mask simply because he or she believes them to be ineffective, then it might be that targeted education may be sufficient. However, given that the belief that masks are ineffective is strongly correlated with mask-related PR (r = .66, p < .001; see S1 Appendix), this approach may be insufficient in many or perhaps most other cases. People who believe masks are ineffective also tend to have high levels of PR. If one tries to persuade a person with high PR that masks are effective, this will elicit reactance in which that person generates further arguments against the effectiveness of masks. The same applies to other reasons for mask refusal (e.g., the belief that masks make people look suspicious). Attempts to counter the majority of reasons for mask refusal will also elicit reactance because mask-related PR lies at the heart of the network of anti-mask attitudes.",

A nudge is something that alters a person's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.

In terms of strengths, the sample was large and the present study was, to our knowledge, the first to use network analysis to understand the interrelationships among anti-mask attitudes and their relationships to other variables that have been shown to influence attitudes and behavior in the context of pandemics. A further strength of the present study was that, compared to previous surveys, the present study examined a larger number of different types of anti-mask attitudes as they related to mask wearing and other variables. A limitation is that not all possible anti-mask attitudes were assessed. Future research is needed to investigate anti-masks attitudes that were not investigated in the present study. For example, the present study did not assess the belief that mask wearing is a sign of weakness, which was an attitude voiced in an Ohio anti-mask rally [66] and identified as a reason for not wearing masks in research published after the present study had been completed [50] . The replicability of the findings across different countries and cultures also remains to be investigated in future research. A further limitation is that network analysis, as a statistical modeling method, is insufficient for determining the causal nature of the relationships between nodes. Nevertheless, the present findings provide a strong rationale for conducting future experimental studies on the causal status of mask-related PR and beliefs that masks are ineffective. The present study also underscores the importance of conducting future research to investigate the efficacy of messaging strategies that take PR into consideration as a means of addressing the problem of mask non-adherence.",
