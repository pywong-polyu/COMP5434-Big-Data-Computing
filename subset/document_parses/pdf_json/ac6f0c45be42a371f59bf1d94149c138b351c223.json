More objective parameters are progressively incorporated and integrated into comprehensive models, on which to support the adoption of therapeutic strategies, since the mere clinical distinction between mediator-related signs/symptoms and \"true\" organ damage can sometimes be complicated. The development of novel targeted drugs is progressively extending the therapeutic alternatives available, which ranges from conventional agents such as interferon and cladribine, to the more modern approach based on KIT inhibition. Ultimately, the choice of the most appropriate therapy should be rationalized on the basis of the clinical picture and molecular data.

Although the clinical manifestations of advanced SM often mandate early initiation of treatment, in other cases the distinction between mediator-related signs/symptoms and \"true\" organ damage can be complicated. As such, the apparently straightforward dichotomy between indolent and advanced variants has to confront with some challenging subsets often encountered in clinical practice (Fig. 1) . In this context, the risk is on one side to overtreat with cytoreductive drugs, on the other to overlook subtle disease-related issues that might deserve a timely therapeutic intervention to avoid further damage. Several biomarkers, including clinical, hematologic, and molecular variables, have been explored, with the aim to provide robust support to clinical management. The inclusion of biological parameters into prognostic models follows this direction. Currently, main therapeutic decisions still rely on the clinical appraisal of the benefit/risk ratio of treatment modalities within indolent and advanced variants according to WHO Classification, with all related limitations to be discussed below.",

In routine practice, the clinician often deals with some challenging subsets, where the choice of the most appropriate therapeutic modality should be evaluated carefully in individual cases Although prognostically meaningful [2] [3] [4] , WHO classification is limited by some relevant flaws. In clinical practice, the distinction between some categories is not always clearcut and the appraisal of some key parameters may be affected by variable interpretation. Furthermore, all C-findings lead to the definition of ASM subset, but they are clearly featured by wide variability in terms of clinical impact. As an example, the clinical impairment caused by liver involvement and portal hypertension can be much more burdensome than a moderate, stable over-time cytopenia. Often it is not just the organ damage per se, rather it is the time of progression of that impairment (Fig. 1) .",

However, SM can also accompany relatively indolent disease (such as essential thrombocythemia) and the SM-AHN incidence is likely underestimated, especially when mast cells burden is low. As such, the enrichment in unfavorable cases likely affects the published survival analyses. Despite WHO allocates this category to \"advanced\" group, in individual cases the SM component should be stratified by B/C-findings in order to estimate its actual clinical impact, even if it can be challenging due to the overlapping with the concomitant AHN ( Fig. 1) . From a therapeutic standpoint, KIT inhibition approach in this setting may lead to different patterns of response depending on the extent of disease addiction to KIT. The latter may be potentially estimated by KIT allele burden, even if there is no established standard yet [8, 9] .",

These findings open an important question about the role of KIT inhibition especially in multi-mutated, myeloid neoplasms, where the efficacy of the approach may be expected to act on the SM component more than on the AHN. The selective pressure exerted by KIT-targeted drugs could remodel the clonal architecture of advanced variants, especially of SM-AHN. That clearly supports the concept of treatment combinations (i.e., KIT inhibitors plus conventional chemotherapy) to be assessed within clinical trials, wherever a complex molecular background would determine scarce response to targeted agents alone.",

The results of a phase 2, nonrandomized clinical trial on 89 patients led to drug approval by regulatory agencies in 2017 for the treatment of adult patients with advanced SM [42] . Midostaurin was given at 100 mg twice daily and showed an overall response rate of 60% according to modified Valent and Cheson criteria [43] . Responses were obtained regardless of KIT mutational status or the presence of concomitant AHN. Midostaurin ameliorated also symptom burden [44] and was well tolerated: beyond hematological toxicity, expected for the clinical context, nausea and vomiting were the most frequent adverse events. They were generally manageable with prophylactic antiemetics and assumption with food. A recent update of data after a 10-year follow-up was published: median overall survival was 40 months in the whole cohort and 18.5 months in MCL subset [45] . No relevant long-term toxicities were observed. Midostaurin is thus an effective therapy both as first-line approach, as well as salvage treatment after other cytoreductive therapies.",

A multiplicity of parameters, clinical and biological, have demonstrated to influence the risk of progression and overall outcome: the most objective among them (molecular genetics in primis) are progressively providing a guide for the selection of the appropriate therapeutic modalities. KIT inhibition currently represents the emerging approach, but also its use needs to be adapted upon the clinical/biological context. Severe mast cell activation syndrome and advanced, multi-mutated SM variants still present many unresolved issues to be tackled in the next future, ideally within prospective clinical trials.",
