            "text": "The design of bone scaffold involves the analysis of stress shielding, which can occur when the Young's modulus of the implant is higher than the Young's modulus of the bone it is replacing, leading to bone decay in the surrounding tissue. It is therefore very important that the material is adequately designed to match the properties of the surrounding tissue, allowing an appropriate load transfer. While some approaches exist in the literature exploring functional gradients of material density, there are much less solutions based on biological laws. A homogenized model of gyroid infill obtained with PLA ( E = 3145 MPa) was obtained through mechanical tests of 3D printed specimens, namely tensile and compression, and the obtained model was implemented in a bone remodelling algorithm. The homogenized law was compared to the results obtained with a bone tissue law to assess the equivalence of density distribution and mechanical properties. Through a radial point interpolation method, it was found that similar density fields were obtained for the gyroid infill and for bone tissue when subject to the same boundary conditions. The finite element method was also used for comparison and validation. With the density field results, the gyroid mechanical behaviour was extrapolated to other materials, and similar stiffness values were obtained for bone tissue and titanium alloy ( E = 110 GPa) scaffold, which justify this proposal of gyroid scaffolds for mimicking bone properties.",

With this approach, it is not necessary to use high-fidelity discretization of the cellular geometry, which decreases the computational cost of the analysis. These approaches take significant interest in the field of biomechanics where unit cells can be designed in a way that its homogenized properties will fit the properties of the tissue it replaces. For instance, Lin et al. [14] developed an homogenization-based optimization procedure which aimed at obtaining the unit cell matching the necessary mechanical properties. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a homogeneous material law which simplifies the RVE in the form of C C * = f ( r ) where C is the homogeneous material constant, C * is the respective constant of the building material, and r is the relative density of the RVE. In this work, the material law being used to characterize the gyroid infill was obtained experimentally and is the form of E = f ( app ) , that is, the law is defined for the building material.",

            "text": "With regard to the use of bone remodelling and topology algorithms to develop and study bone implants, there are several examples in the literature. In 2007, Harrysson et al. [15] mentioned the possibility of using optimization algorithms to develop non-stochastic mesh implants to improve the properties of the hip stem prosthesis. Ghaziani et al. [16] studied a bone growth through a bone remodelling algorithm to test the design of several functionally graded material (FGM) prostheses. The algorithm uses a strain energy density (SED)-based approach, where the density is updated according to the stimulus and Wu et al. [17] evaluated bone ingrowth in the scaffold as a function of the mechanical stimulus. These approaches are concerned with the osteointegration of bone in the implant, by considering previously defined scaffold designs. Wu et al. [18] used topology optimization to develop bone plates with optimal design to maximize bone density where the bone remodelling step is followed by an optimization step. On a different approach, Chuah et al. [19] applied topology optimization to design a spinal interbody cage with the aim of reducing stress shielding. This work presents the main difference that it uses the bone remodelling inspired algorithm to design the scaffold itself. The principle behind it is that as in bone remodelling, the material will develop as a function of the mechanical stimulus, and in accordance with its properties. It is proposed that the gyroid foam will follow a gradient similar to the gradients verified in bone tissue.",

Then, DEM evolved and the element-free Galerkin method [23] was developed. The smooth particle hydrodynamics method [24] (a pioneer particle/meshless method for particle interactions) was modified and originated the reproducing Kernel particle method [25] . The meshless local Petrov-Galerkin [26] method evolved into the method of the finite spheres [27] , the finite-point method [28, 29] , the radial basis function method [30, 31] . The shape functions constructed through these methods lack the Kronecker delta property [20] , and thus, the essential boundary conditions cannot be directly imposed in the system of equations, increasing the computational cost of the analysis. Thus, other methods have been more recently developed in order to overcome this obstacle such as: the point interpolation method [32] , the point assembly method [33] , the radial point interpolation method (RPIM) [34, 35] , the meshless finite element method [36] , the natural neighbour finite element method [37, 38] and the natural element method (NEM) [39] [40] [41] , the natural radial element method (NREM) [42] [43] [44] and the Natural neighbour radial point interpolation method (NNRPIM) [45] , which is a combination of the NEM and the RPIM.",

Using the isoparametric functions the quadrature points are obtained in Cartesian coordinates (following the same procedure used by FEM to establish the integration points inside each element).

Influence domains are formed by the nodes in the vicinity of a said interest point (which is commonly a integration point).

Due to its simplicity, several meshless methods apply this concept [23, 25, 26, 34, 48] . The performance of the method is heavily dependent on the size and shape of the influence domains. Preferably, each domain should have approximately the same number of nodes. For a 2D problem, the number of n d nodes inside the influence domain should be n d = [9, 16] [20].

Thus, for the voxel model, it was considered an 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 integration scheme for each cell (thus having 8 integration points inside each cell), and for the realistic model, the cells were tetrahedral and the integration scheme consisted of one integration point in the barycenter of each cell.

The applied loads aim to replicate the most prevalent load case at the proximal femur [20] : a compression load at the femur head (from the hip joint) and the traction load at the greater trochanter (from the trochanter inserted tendons). At each iteration, the design variables are brought to their elastic limit, through (25) and (28) , and thus, unitary forces were applied, being that the upwards vertical force corresponds to 1/3 of the downwards vertical force.

In model V, the RPIM calculated higher values of stiffness and for model R the highest values of stiffness coefficient were calculated with the FEM. Due to the properties of the homogenized gyroid model, the stiffness coefficient first decreases slightly and then decreases more abruptly. Thus, when avg app \u2215 0 reaches 0.6, it is observed a high rate of stiffness loss in the material as the apparent density decreases.

This will mean that the porosity configuration will be similar. Figure 7 is shown the apparent density field for structures with 50% of the initial mass, for both materials. Therefore, it can be evaluated if the functional gradients, naturally occurring in bone tissue, can be mimicked by other materials. This is important since bone tissue scaffold design must also include the study of permeability and porosity (which are important for cell proliferation) and thus, viability of the implant [6, 10, 60] . Again, it is visible that the structure evolves into two large bars joined by a thin bar. Since the remodelling algorithm acts as a topology optimization algorithm, the formed structures will present configurations that maximize strength for that load case, hence, the two large trabeculae. The horizontal distance between the load application in NR1 and NR2 generates flexural moment and meaning that strength will depend on the thin bar. Finally, it is studied the possibility of using other materials to manufacture gyroid scaffold with the appropriate mechanical properties. Assuming that the displacements observed in any two materials (defined by a bi-linear elastic-plastic law) can be obtained by a proportionality constant; then, the stiffness coefficient of a titanium scaffold can be approximated from the stiffness coefficient of a PLA scaffold within the elastic regime. For this, the following expression was used to extrapolate the mechanical properties of titanium scaffold: Therefore, using (34) , the mechanical properties of the gyroid infill, adjusted to the Young's modulus of titanium [61] ( E Ti = 110 GPa), were obtained, which are shown in Fig. 8 .

In terms of scaffold adequateness, stiffness is lower than the stiffness of bone, for equivalent porosity values. However, the approximation in (34) is not possible to be used to approximate load-bearing capability, because the material strength is independent of the modulus, i.e. a material can present high modulus and low yield stress. Therefore, the next step in the design could be the evaluation of load-bearing capacity of the scaffold. Thus, for values of avg app \u2215 0 = 0.5 , it is evaluated using the FEM and the RPIM, the von Mises stress in both models considering the bone tissue law (Fig. 9) , which presents the stress values that the hypothetical titanium scaffold should be able to withstand. It can be seen in Fig. 9a that with Model V, the stress level measured with the FEM is lower than the stress level measured with the RPIM. During the remodelling process, the applied force is updated at each remodelling stage. Using (21) the set of points being remodelled is chosen, and based on the stress level, the variables are brought to the elastic limit. During the remodelling process, some points can present a high stress level and still be under the elastic limit, while presenting higher stress than the overall structure. This will update the applied force in a way that a much lower force is applied in the following iteration steps. The stiffness coefficient will remain the same because the lower force will generate a proportionally lower displacement. Figure 10 shows that in model V, from iteration 5 forward, the value of force in the FEM is lower. It can be seen that the stress map at iteration 1 is coherent for both methods, as well as the values of F z from iterations 1 to 5.",

Thus, the von Mises equivalent stress field obtained with the gyroid PLA is not presented. Thus, the titanium scaffold should be able to withstand at least the 700 MPa which occur in bone tissue. According to the work by Bobbert et al. [6] , the titanium scaffolds show enough yield stress. However, since the scaffold geometry tested by Bobbert is not the same as the scaffold geometry tested by Silva et al. [58] it is not possible to obtain conclusions.",

Considering that in a near future, this technique is to be combined with additive manufacturing, an extremely intricate trabecular structure is to complex to be transformed into a gradient part. So, for that reason, the level of detail obtained can be enough to design the scaffold, without wasting computational power in an extremely detailed discretization Finally, the hypothetical titanium scaffold obtains scaffolds with lower density than bone which will prevent stress shielding. However, it should be mentioned that the gyroid infill is an approximation of the gyroid geometry and the manufacturing process will influence the mechanical properties, because the titanium scaffold cannot be manufactured the exact same way as the PLA infill.",
